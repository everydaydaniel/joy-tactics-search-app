0:01:03 - 0:01:04::We are so back.
0:01:04 - 0:01:05::It's awesome.
0:01:05 - 0:01:06::I got an Halloween of all days.
0:01:06 - 0:01:07::Super lightheaded.
0:01:07 - 0:01:08::Me too, man.
0:01:08 - 0:01:10::It's the Halloween one.
0:01:10 - 0:01:21::Everybody wants us to do a themed one, everyone, so while.
0:01:21 - 0:01:22::I know.
0:01:22 - 0:01:24::And finally, we're doing one.
0:01:24 - 0:01:26::Should we explain what our costumes are?
0:01:26 - 0:01:27::Yes, we should.
0:01:27 - 0:01:29::Yeah, let's get this out of the way first off.
0:01:29 - 0:01:34::So, um, I am...
0:01:34 - 0:01:36::Michael Jackson?
0:01:36 - 0:01:38::I'm sort of a weird...
0:01:38 - 0:01:45::So I'm wearing a wig right now and some sunglasses from Walgreens.
0:01:45 - 0:01:51::And my costume is a little bit different than most people's costumes.
0:01:51 - 0:01:58::They dress up like as a character or a figure from history.
0:01:58 - 0:02:04::And what I am is I am my ideal version of myself.
0:02:04 - 0:02:11::So this is how I want to kind of look and be as to the world 24-7.
0:02:11 - 0:02:14::And I'm just becoming that for one day Halloween.
0:02:14 - 0:02:16::That's why Halloween is kind of special to me,
0:02:16 - 0:02:19::because you can be whoever you want to be.
0:02:19 - 0:02:21::Thank God I'm not me.
0:02:21 - 0:02:24::You know, I think you guys can relate to that a little bit.
0:02:24 - 0:02:28::Being taking a break from ourselves once in a while.
0:02:28 - 0:02:30::Yeah, I can relate to that.
0:02:30 - 0:02:35::Yeah, even if that means by being yourself on fucking steroids.
0:02:35 - 0:02:36::Yeah.
0:02:36 - 0:02:38::I feel like some of y'all, some of y'all out there,
0:02:38 - 0:02:41::should your Halloween costume should be the true you?
0:02:41 - 0:02:42::Right.
0:02:42 - 0:02:44::Who are you behind this facade?
0:02:44 - 0:02:46::Who are you behind the mask?
0:02:46 - 0:02:50::Let's see what you really are like at that Halloween party.
0:02:50 - 0:02:53::And what you are, what your costume is,
0:02:53 - 0:02:57::whether you like it or not, but that is what you are.
0:02:57 - 0:03:00::You have come to this conclusion to be that,
0:03:00 - 0:03:04::and it is really who you are, right?
0:03:04 - 0:03:07::If you really think about it, who are you?
0:03:07 - 0:03:09::You are Dr. House.
0:03:09 - 0:03:11::Why?
0:03:11 - 0:03:13::Why are you being Dr. House for Halloween?
0:03:13 - 0:03:18::Because you are holding on to a time in your life when your parents were still together
0:03:18 - 0:03:20::and that was on TV and it sticks in your brain.
0:03:20 - 0:03:21::You know what I mean?
0:03:21 - 0:03:22::Like I could look at, I could, I could,
0:03:22 - 0:03:26::this is, I don't even go to Halloween costumes because all I'm doing is fucking breaking people down
0:03:26 - 0:03:29::and analyzing them psychologically based on health.
0:03:29 - 0:03:33::And in a way, people don't like you coming to parties like that.
0:03:33 - 0:03:37::By the way, I've heard from several people that I'm like the,
0:03:37 - 0:03:42::I'm like the fucking David Blaine of psychological analysis.
0:03:43 - 0:03:45::Outfit based psychological analysis.
0:03:45 - 0:03:47::Eric, go ahead, man.
0:03:47 - 0:03:48::Who the fuck are you?
0:03:48 - 0:03:50::Well, where are you, Jack?
0:03:50 - 0:03:51::Oh, my bad.
0:03:51 - 0:03:52::Yeah, Jack, who are you?
0:03:52 - 0:03:55::I'm Dr. Pull-ups.
0:03:55 - 0:03:56::Dr. Pull-ups.
0:03:56 - 0:03:58::Oh, okay, I see it now.
0:03:58 - 0:03:59::I got the pull-up bar on me.
0:03:59 - 0:04:00::Oh, I see it.
0:04:00 - 0:04:02::Maybe I should be Sergeant Pull-up, Lieutenant Pull-ups.
0:04:02 - 0:04:08::Because looking at the pull-up is one of the best exercises you could do.
0:04:08 - 0:04:12::I would like to see somebody really short-take-a-pull-up on you.
0:04:12 - 0:04:16::Like, you know, somebody who could really like get off the ground or a child.
0:04:16 - 0:04:22::You know who you look like, Jack, is that Australian teenager who has that party with the sunglasses on?
0:04:22 - 0:04:24::He's on the new-gett-interviews on the news.
0:04:24 - 0:04:25::Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
0:04:25 - 0:04:27::He's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he'sincredible.
0:04:27 - 0:04:28::Yeah.
0:04:28 - 0:04:36::Do you feel bad about making a party that bothered you, neighbors and people went to the hospital?
0:04:36 - 0:04:37::I feel horrible.
0:04:37 - 0:04:38::I can't believe I've done this.
0:04:38 - 0:04:39::That's fine.
0:04:39 - 0:04:41::Well, he goes like, nah.
0:04:41 - 0:04:42::Oh, yeah.
0:04:42 - 0:04:43::Nah.
0:04:43 - 0:04:46::Actually, I have fun, man.
0:04:46 - 0:04:47::Halloween.
0:04:47 - 0:04:54::Okay, Eric, who the fuck are you, Ashley Simpson?
0:04:54 - 0:04:56::After the lase, lase it.
0:04:56 - 0:05:00::No, man, I'm not Ashley.

0:05:00 - 0:05:02::just instant after the lycheec.
0:05:02 - 0:05:04.240000::You sounded offended by that.
0:05:04.240000 - 0:05:05.960000::I know, I took a minute to process that
0:05:05.960000 - 0:05:08::because I was shocked that you would say something that
0:05:08 - 0:05:10.320000::who are against Ashley like that?
0:05:10.320000 - 0:05:14.160000::Well, I'm a rocker, a rocker,
0:05:14.160000 - 0:05:16.120000::mourning after a one night stand.
0:05:18.240000 - 0:05:20.600000::And so you, you know what you look like is,
0:05:20.600000 - 0:05:22.080000::well, you look like Skrillex.
0:05:22.080000 - 0:05:22.920000::Who?
0:05:22.920000 - 0:05:23.760000::Skrillex?
0:05:23.760000 - 0:05:26.280000::I don't look like Skrillex, man.
0:05:26.280000 - 0:05:27.120000::Do I?
0:05:27.840000 - 0:05:30.480000::Yeah, no, just because, you know, his trademark
0:05:30.480000 - 0:05:33.120000::or he used to be, he grew out his hair now,
0:05:33.120000 - 0:05:34.920000::but the trademark was the,
0:05:34.920000 - 0:05:37.560000::you know, shaved side of the head.
0:05:37.560000 - 0:05:38.720000::The undercut.
0:05:38.720000 - 0:05:39.560000::Yeah.
0:05:41.760000 - 0:05:42.440000::Cool, man.
0:05:42.440000 - 0:05:43.640000::Well, that's a really fun costume.
0:05:43.640000 - 0:05:46.120000::We got Nate, a rocker.
0:05:46.120000 - 0:05:49.960000::Nate is himself if he had money for the hair transplant.
0:05:49.960000 - 0:05:55.560000::And here is a rocker, not identified.
0:05:55.560000 - 0:05:56.840000::Straight rocker.
0:05:56.840000 - 0:05:58.120000::Who am I?
0:05:58.120000 - 0:06:00.440000::Oh, Eric is a post sexual rocker.
0:06:03.440000 - 0:06:05.760000::And I'm, what did I say, Dr. Pullups?
0:06:07 - 0:06:07.840000::Yes.
0:06:07.840000 - 0:06:08.840000::Dr. P.
0:06:08.840000 - 0:06:10.360000::You know what is funny to the listeners,
0:06:10.360000 - 0:06:12.800000::a little inside information on what has just occurred.
0:06:12.800000 - 0:06:13.800000::Dr. P.
0:06:13.800000 - 0:06:14.640000::Sorry.
0:06:14.640000 - 0:06:17.800000::We all, about 30 seconds before recording said,
0:06:17.800000 - 0:06:20.320000::oh, it's Halloween, let's go get our costumes on.
0:06:20.320000 - 0:06:22.640000::No, none of us had any planned costumes.
0:06:22.640000 - 0:06:25::And we all independently without talking about it,
0:06:25 - 0:06:28.040000::we just showed up with the wig and sunglasses.
0:06:28.040000 - 0:06:28.960000::That's special.
0:06:28.960000 - 0:06:30.360000::There's something, there's something
0:06:30.360000 - 0:06:31.920000::synchronicious about that.
0:06:31.920000 - 0:06:34.400000::Synchroniciously amazing.
0:06:34.400000 - 0:06:35.960000::Can we get a running list of words
0:06:35.960000 - 0:06:37.720000::that we've made up on this?
0:06:37.720000 - 0:06:38.640000::If we're suspicious.
0:06:38.640000 - 0:06:39.640000::I'm not kidding you.
0:06:39.640000 - 0:06:41.160000::We are, you know who else,
0:06:41.160000 - 0:06:43.320000::you know who else used to make up words?
0:06:43.320000 - 0:06:44.800000::Who shakes beer?
0:06:44.800000 - 0:06:46.080000::Shakespeare did.
0:06:46.080000 - 0:06:46.920000::Really?
0:06:46.920000 - 0:06:49.840000::Nobody has really been making up words since.
0:06:49.840000 - 0:06:53.560000::And I'm just, I just want to draw that comparison.
0:06:53.560000 - 0:06:54.400000::Did he really?
0:06:54.400000 - 0:06:56.120000::No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
0:06:56.120000 - 0:06:59.320000::He had, he came up with 100,000 words in the,
0:06:59.320000 - 0:07:00.760000::are you serious?
0:07:00.760000 - 0:07:04.560000::Because he was so prolific, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
0:07:04.560000 - 0:07:06.080000::is this real?
0:07:06.080000 - 0:07:06.800000::Can we Google this?
0:07:06.800000 - 0:07:07.320000::Yes.
0:07:07.320000 - 0:07:08.600000::Can we Google this?
0:07:08.600000 - 0:07:09.520000::There's no need, dude.
0:07:09.520000 - 0:07:12.640000::Can we stop no-googling everything?
0:07:12.640000 - 0:07:13.480000::Yeah.
0:07:13.480000 - 0:07:15.200000::Just believe something for a second.
0:07:15.200000 - 0:07:16.440000::I'm just believe unnecessary.
0:07:16.440000 - 0:07:18.240000::I'm not, I believe you.
0:07:18.240000 - 0:07:22.360000::I just am wanting to know where the
0:07:22.360000 - 0:07:23.360000::end of the book is.
0:07:23.360000 - 0:07:24.360000::I'm going to pull up prison.
0:07:24.360000 - 0:07:25.360000::I am.
0:07:25.360000 - 0:07:28.080000::It's draft, it's, it's, it's latching on the back of my chair.
0:07:28.080000 - 0:07:31.480000::Jack has a pull up bar over his head, by the way.
0:07:31.480000 - 0:07:33.280000::And let me just, just for the listeners,
0:07:33.280000 - 0:07:38.040000::you'll quick describe Eric has a long hair wig.
0:07:38.040000 - 0:07:40.680000::Does look like Skrillex sort of right now.
0:07:40.680000 - 0:07:44.240000::I have a kind of beetle style wig.
0:07:44.240000 - 0:07:45.760000::All of us have sunglasses.
0:07:45.760000 - 0:07:51.800000::Jack has kind of red, like Oakley style,
0:07:51.800000 - 0:07:56.520000::like a trucker style sunglasses.
0:07:56.520000 - 0:08:00.440000::Do you want to hear some of the words that Shakespeare made up?
0:08:00.440000 - 0:08:01.280000::Yeah.
0:08:01.280000 - 0:08:02.120000::God, I just googled this.
0:08:02.120000 - 0:08:04.320000::So Eric just said don't Google this, trust me,
0:08:04.320000 - 0:08:05.800000::and look what you, and look what's out there.
0:08:05.800000 - 0:08:06.320000::Well, guess what?
0:08:06.320000 - 0:08:08.240000::Eric was 30 minutes late today, so I'm not
0:08:08.240000 - 0:08:09.840000::wanting to see you and take you to my shop.
0:08:09.840000 - 0:08:10.600000::Oh, here we go.
0:08:10.600000 - 0:08:11.400000::Oh, God, gas, man.
0:08:11.400000 - 0:08:11.920000::Here we go.
0:08:11.920000 - 0:08:14.080000::I'm going to go.
0:08:14.080000 - 0:08:16.960000::Didn't we just talk about this, Eric?
0:08:16.960000 - 0:08:17.640000::I know.
0:08:17.640000 - 0:08:20.640000::You can't imagine the shame that I felt when I woke up.
0:08:20.680000 - 0:08:21.840000::Well, here's what's interesting.
0:08:21.840000 - 0:08:24.760000::I woke up earlier than all of you guys.
0:08:24.760000 - 0:08:27.080000::And much earlier, I know I didn't text you,
0:08:27.080000 - 0:08:28.400000::but I was up at 8 a.m.
0:08:28.400000 - 0:08:31.200000::walking the dog, taking her out to go potty,
0:08:31.200000 - 0:08:33.080000::giving her her morning routine.
0:08:33.080000 - 0:08:35.680000::And then I just so happened to fall asleep again
0:08:35.680000 - 0:08:37.840000::and woke up very late for this.
0:08:37.840000 - 0:08:40.680000::So in a sense, I was the earliest one up.
0:08:40.680000 - 0:08:43.440000::Sounds like the dog walked you, man.
0:08:43.440000 - 0:08:44.280000::No.
0:08:44.280000 - 0:08:48.680000::Oh, no, she didn't, man.
0:08:48.680000 - 0:08:49.440000::You have to.
0:08:49.440000 - 0:08:52.680000::I feel like you are at a level of you need to repent.
0:08:52.680000 - 0:08:56.640000::Before I was like, you need to apologize and make right
0:08:56.640000 - 0:08:57.240000::with the world.
0:08:57.240000 - 0:08:59.560000::And I feel like a repentance is like the word
0:08:59.560000 - 0:09:01.040000::that I'm looking for right now.
0:09:01.040000 - 0:09:04.560000::You need to make this right with God.
0:09:04.560000 - 0:09:07.080000::This is no longer about us right now.
0:09:07.080000 - 0:09:09.040000::You need to make this right with the universe
0:09:09.040000 - 0:09:11.040000::because you have disrespected us.
0:09:11.040000 - 0:09:15.520000::And in turn, you have disrespected God in the universe.
0:09:15.520000 - 0:09:16.480000::Do you know how to repent?
0:09:16.480000 - 0:09:20.200000::Is that something that's familiar to you?
0:09:20.200000 - 0:09:22.840000::Repentance is how I was raised, man.
0:09:22.840000 - 0:09:25::Don't get me started on repentance.
0:09:25 - 0:09:30::I was so guilt-ridden that I was repenting daily.
0:09:30 - 0:09:31.960000::I know what the problem is with repentance.
0:09:31.960000 - 0:09:33.400000::I'll tell you right now.
0:09:33.400000 - 0:09:34.640000::By the minute.
0:09:34.640000 - 0:09:37.320000::It's similar to a setback being accepted to a comeback.
0:09:37.320000 - 0:09:41.440000::A repentance is a...
0:09:41.440000 - 0:09:45.040000::A repentance is a recipe for repition.
0:09:45.040000 - 0:09:48.640000::Because if you know that you can repent,
0:09:48.640000 - 0:09:51.720000::you are going to repeat.
0:09:51.720000 - 0:09:54.920000::So what needs to happen is there's no more repenting.
0:09:54.920000 - 0:09:58.320000::You can't repent to the God of, there's only repent.
0:09:58.320000 - 0:09:59.480000::There's no repent.
0:09:59.480000 - 0:10:00.480000::I want you to repent.

0:10:00 - 0:10:04.220000::You're in the pentatentiary at that point over and for good damn the joy

0:15:30.200000 - 0:15:38.120000::Oh, so there are 13 years of my life, the most formative years, maybe the most fun years
0:15:38.120000 - 0:15:43.040000::when Halloween is special when you get to dress up like Buzz Lightyear, your favorite character.
0:15:43.040000 - 0:15:46.160000::And you get to go out and get candy and all that.
0:15:46.160000 - 0:15:48.400000::I didn't get to experience that.

0:16:19.920000 - 0:16:21.800000::Because Halloween is such a demonic holiday.
0:16:21.800000 - 0:16:23.280000::I didn't know it's about you.
0:16:23.280000 - 0:16:29.720000::You're Satan and I would have to sit outside the classroom in the hallway with one other

0:16:32.760000 - 0:16:37.600000::And we would have to just do nothing while everyone would make their little Halloween pumpkin

0:19:32.480000 - 0:19:33.480000::No.
0:19:33.480000 - 0:19:34.480000::I can't eat a candy.
0:19:34.480000 - 0:19:35.480000::Oh my god.
0:19:35.740000 - 0:19:37.720000::Parents.
0:19:37.720000 - 0:19:41.560000::Um we love you guys but we don't forgive you for this.
0:19:41.560000 - 0:19:49.040000::Also my mom is I just talked to my mom and she does listen to the podcast.
0:19:49.040000 - 0:19:57.600000::Oh and she will bring up things that basically I mentioned her specifically or like a parent
0:19:57.600000 - 0:20:00::thing and I want to say

0:20:00 - 0:20:05::say mom if you're listening right now, it didn't affect me at all that this was happening
0:20:05 - 0:20:10::and this is one of those moments that I was talking about where I'm like, you know, joking
0:20:10 - 0:20:16.520000::and it's, you know, I'm actually all good. So shout out to mom, love you. Shout out.
0:20:16.520000 - 0:20:22.600000::And you all went through that together by the way. Yeah, exactly. You know, so that is
0:20:22.600000 - 0:20:28.440000::interesting. I can't help but make it political because Nate now, when I see you on Halloween
0:20:28.440000 - 0:20:32.840000::and this now it makes all makes perfect sense. Well, the side profile with the hair is crazy,
0:20:32.840000 - 0:20:39.240000::Nate, you look amazing. Oh, wow, man, you look like the fucking sexy version of the honeycombs
0:20:39.240000 - 0:20:47.640000::kid. Oh my God. God, you look like a sexy man. Yeah. No, no, wait, you're so much sexy
0:20:47.640000 - 0:20:53.480000::without it. No, you're wasted. Too much stop lying. Stop literally stop lying to me.
0:20:53.480000 - 0:21:00.280000::Everyone stop lying to me. Stop it now. You could do with the, you know, exactly. Please
0:21:00.280000 - 0:21:07.280000::stop it. Everyone just stop. Everybody who's ever told me you look better as a bald man,
0:21:07.280000 - 0:21:14.280000::whatever, just stop. It's just, it's enough enough. Yeah. It's over. You look like
0:21:14.280000 - 0:21:20.040000::a great man. Sorry. Thank you. Right now. Oh, wait, right now. It's like I have relief. Yeah.
0:21:20.040000 - 0:21:25.640000::Yeah. All right. Go on. You're about to politicize something that isn't inherently political,
0:21:25.640000 - 0:21:33.880000::classic Jack Benz. Well, man, you just sounded like an idiot because everything within a political
0:21:33.880000 - 0:21:38.440000::system is political, whether you like it or not, and I can't remember what I was saying. So
0:21:39 - 0:21:46.680000::that's all good. Look how scary this looks. Look how scary this looks. Wow. There's your braces.
0:21:48.360000 - 0:21:53.240000::Does not look like Ghoulish? Who's Ghoulish? Oh, if that, if you're listening, I'm putting my mouth
0:21:53.240000 - 0:21:57.880000::open in a way that scares me. My ass just to look at. Here's what I was going to say is this.
0:21:58.760000 - 0:22:05.080000::I was wondering why Nate on Halloween, do you kind of like eat chocolate in a way that looks like
0:22:05.080000 - 0:22:10.920000::you just got rescued from a desert island. A desert? What did you say? Oh, desert island.
0:22:12.680000 - 0:22:16.840000::You know, a lot of people have a hard time spelling desert and desert, but you mix it up just
0:22:16.840000 - 0:22:24.840000::the way you say it. Did I say that wrong? You said a desert island. I did that. All right. Drop it.
0:22:28.040000 - 0:22:33.720000::I have seen Nate eat candy before and it is fucking nuts. It is like a like a frostbitten
0:22:33.720000 - 0:22:42.520000::finger. It's like an animal fry. Yeah. The first time they get some human food. I make a lot
0:22:42.520000 - 0:22:50.280000::of noise. I'll choose kind of like comical the way I do it. Yeah. And so what it to tie
0:22:50.280000 - 0:23:00.040000::this into politics is the age of drinking consent. Wow. In a sense, like how when kids start
0:23:00.040000 - 0:23:04.040000::binging because they're not allowed to drink alcohol till they're 21. You weren't allowed to eat
0:23:04.040000 - 0:23:09.400000::candy until you were 13. And so you're making up for lost time every Halloween, you're dressing up as
0:23:09.400000 - 0:23:15.400000::like fucking for you're switching costumes once an hour. You're like breaking into people's houses
0:23:15.400000 - 0:23:19.880000::for a week afterwards. You don't even want candy. You just bust into the fridge and start slurping
0:23:19.880000 - 0:23:26.040000::roast beef sucking it down. Nate, why are you so still, man? You're like, yeah, why are you so
0:23:26.040000 - 0:23:32.760000::looking like you in neck brace? Well, you know what? I put my mic stand. It's below the computer
0:23:32.760000 - 0:23:41.880000::right here. And sometimes I'm leaning in a little bit to get the audio. I kind of like the mic
0:23:41.880000 - 0:23:47.560000::stand style. I do too. I'm going handheld with it. And I kind of feel more free. I feel like I can
0:23:47.560000 - 0:23:53.240000::say. Same dude. You know, as the people know, I'm part Italian. And Italians like to speak with
0:23:53.240000 - 0:23:59.800000::their hands. So I feel like I'm kind of limiting my racial abilities to, you know, because down
0:23:59.800000 - 0:24:04.680000::here I'm doing a lot of you can't see it, but I'm doing right. I'm very still and we're still
0:24:04.680000 - 0:24:11.800000::manner. When are we going to get the Joe Rogan sure microphones? I like those. They're sexy.
0:24:11.800000 - 0:24:16.200000::Where are you saying that? I was going to ask you to say something Italian. But like that.
0:24:24.200000 - 0:24:30.120000::Man, yeah. Oh, you're really speaking Italian. Yes. But your hands are moving. Is that so?
0:24:30.120000 - 0:24:35::Is it when they speak Italian people speak English? They miss like the rolling of the tongue and
0:24:35 - 0:24:40.040000::stuff. And that's that energy coming out. Oh, maybe yeah, yeah, yeah, totally.
0:24:40.040000 - 0:24:46.120000::I just found this out. Should I do this? I'll bring you guys along with me. What is it, man?
0:24:46.120000 - 0:24:54.760000::What's happening? I just found out that I can have dual citizenship in Italy.
0:24:54.760000 - 0:24:59.800000::And you're bringing us with you? Is that me? Well, I could, I think,

0:25:00 - 0:25:01.240000::I don't know, I don't know.
0:25:01.240000 - 0:25:05.600000::I will do everything in my abilities to get you guys
0:25:05.600000 - 0:25:09.160000::to my Italian villa when the, when shit goes down.
0:25:09.160000 - 0:25:14.160000::But I think that I feel like I need to pursue this.
0:25:16.200000 - 0:25:18.680000::Because I know maybe some apocalyptic.
0:25:18.680000 - 0:25:20.480000::You know about this, right Nate?
0:25:20.480000 - 0:25:24.720000::The dollar homes that they have all was scattered across Italy.
0:25:24.720000 - 0:25:25.560000::Yeah.
0:25:25.560000 - 0:25:28.760000::Dalar, well, they're in extreme disrepair.
0:25:28.760000 - 0:25:32.440000::There's no electricity, but you can pass on these homes
0:25:32.440000 - 0:25:36.960000::for nothing and go in and come in as the American neighbor
0:25:36.960000 - 0:25:41.200000::that everybody's gonna love who just got their dual citizenship,
0:25:41.200000 - 0:25:44.920000::clean up the home, put in a pool, put in DJ booth,
0:25:44.920000 - 0:25:48.560000::and buy all marshmallow, all the DJs to come go crazy.
0:25:49.560000 - 0:25:52.520000::That's gonna be, please, please.
0:25:52.520000 - 0:25:55.160000::What's your Italian name gonna be Nate?
0:25:55.160000 - 0:25:57.840000::Because you can't be Nate or I don't, I guess I know.
0:25:57.840000 - 0:25:58.680000::I don't know.
0:25:58.680000 - 0:25:59.760000::You gotta be Nate.
0:25:59.760000 - 0:26:02.280000::But I gotta be Giovanni.
0:26:02.280000 - 0:26:03.440000::Giovanni.
0:26:03.440000 - 0:26:05.560000::Like Giovanni.
0:26:05.560000 - 0:26:07.160000::Giovanni Salmanella.
0:26:07.160000 - 0:26:08.560000::Lingua.
0:26:08.560000 - 0:26:12.160000::Lingua, lingua, lingua, Zemo.
0:26:12.160000 - 0:26:14.720000::Giovanni, lingua, lingua, Zemo.
0:26:14.720000 - 0:26:17.040000::It's really close to John Lagoza.
0:26:17.040000 - 0:26:19.600000::John Lago, lingua, lingua, lingua, Zemo.
0:26:19.600000 - 0:26:22.120000::Giovanni, I'm gonna be Bradicio Pete.
0:26:22.120000 - 0:26:22.960000::What about this?
0:26:22.960000 - 0:26:23.800000::Bradicio.
0:26:24.640000 - 0:26:29.320000::You sounded like you spoke like perfect Italian just then.
0:26:29.320000 - 0:26:31.080000::I do speak pretty fucking good Italian.
0:26:31.080000 - 0:26:33.400000::Nobody knows that, but I speak pretty good every language.
0:26:33.400000 - 0:26:35.080000::I know, yeah, that's interesting.
0:26:35.080000 - 0:26:37.200000::So no, no, no, regazzo piccolo.
0:26:37.200000 - 0:26:40.880000::I heard that just to compare you to a comedy legend,
0:26:40.880000 - 0:26:42.160000::this is a little comedy,
0:26:43.680000 - 0:26:46.440000::historic knowledge that you can get from Manus Galco.
0:26:46.440000 - 0:26:49.120000::Yeah, I know it's not, man.
0:26:49.120000 - 0:26:51.800000::It's about a guy named, and no one's gonna care about this,
0:26:51.800000 - 0:26:52.640000::and I don't even know him,
0:26:52.640000 - 0:26:54.320000::I'm bringing up right now as I'm saying this,
0:26:54.320000 - 0:26:57.160000::but there was a guy named Sid Caesar.
0:26:57.160000 - 0:26:58::You guys familiar?
0:26:58 - 0:26:59.840000::No, because you don't worry about.
0:26:59.840000 - 0:27:02.560000::Because you guys don't fucking care about the history
0:27:02.560000 - 0:27:05.720000::of comedy, and you don't even know anything about the,
0:27:05.720000 - 0:27:07.360000::the people that came before you.
0:27:07.360000 - 0:27:08.360000::You don't even know.
0:27:08.360000 - 0:27:10.440000::All you have about the comedy in college,
0:27:10.440000 - 0:27:12.320000::at Columbia College, I think you might not know.
0:27:12.320000 - 0:27:14.480000::But you didn't fucking pay attention to it.
0:27:14.480000 - 0:27:17.320000::Because you were too focused on watching adults swim,
0:27:17.320000 - 0:27:19.240000::and that's all you know about right now.
0:27:19.240000 - 0:27:20.080000::You don't know anything.
0:27:20.080000 - 0:27:20.920000::I've never seen adults swim.
0:27:20.920000 - 0:27:22.120000::I don't even know what that is.
0:27:22.200000 - 0:27:23.200000::All of those books.
0:27:23.200000 - 0:27:27.120000::If you don't even talk to me right now, what are you saying?
0:27:27.120000 - 0:27:27.960000::Yeah.
0:27:27.960000 - 0:27:29.200000::What are we talking about?
0:27:29.200000 - 0:27:30.760000::Let me educate you guys,
0:27:30.760000 - 0:27:32.360000::because you guys don't know anything about it.
0:27:32.360000 - 0:27:34.280000::Sid Caesar, of course I know who that is.
0:27:34.280000 - 0:27:36.200000::You guys have no idea who this is.
0:27:36.200000 - 0:27:37.280000::You guys have no idea who this is.
0:27:37.280000 - 0:27:40.040000::Because you don't study history, and you have no fucking.
0:27:40.040000 - 0:27:41.440000::And I just noticed there's a mirror.
0:27:41.440000 - 0:27:42.920000::I can see in the mirror in the background,
0:27:42.920000 - 0:27:45.960000::we can see us on the Zoom.
0:27:45.960000 - 0:27:50.960000::Anyways, Sid Caesar, he's one of the great comedic performers
0:27:51.800000 - 0:27:56.560000::of the 50s, of the 40s, 60s.
0:27:56.560000 - 0:28:01.560000::And he apparently had this ability to speak any language.
0:28:01.560000 - 0:28:03.440000::If you said, hey, speak French,
0:28:03.440000 - 0:28:04.880000::he didn't know how to speak French,
0:28:04.880000 - 0:28:08.480000::but the way that he would speak was so convincing
0:28:08.480000 - 0:28:11.640000::that he would convince people that he could speak that language.
0:28:11.640000 - 0:28:12.480000::Oh.
0:28:12.480000 - 0:28:14.560000::Isn't that kind of incredible?
0:28:14.560000 - 0:28:16.200000::So he was a liar.
0:28:16.200000 - 0:28:18.160000::Yeah, right right now, French.
0:28:21.240000 - 0:28:25.080000::So I can have a little bit of that.
0:28:25.080000 - 0:28:27.560000::You know, based on the way that you pronounce
0:28:27.560000 - 0:28:30.560000::and deal with Spanish speaking people
0:28:30.560000 - 0:28:33.360000::when we're in the country or whatever,
0:28:33.360000 - 0:28:35.960000::you are, I think, born to do French
0:28:35.960000 - 0:28:37.560000::compared to the Spanish.
0:28:37.560000 - 0:28:39.760000::J'acala-cou-lue.
0:28:39.760000 - 0:28:42.760000::J'ai la suyilla, mon chile de cou-lue.
0:28:42.760000 - 0:28:44.160000::Malachak-mala.
0:28:44.160000 - 0:28:46.040000::Malachak-mala.
0:28:46.040000 - 0:28:47.960000::Cheete-le-t-le-t-le-t-le-t-le-t-le-t-le-t-le-t-le.
0:28:47.960000 - 0:28:49.280000::M'achala-cou-lue.
0:28:49.280000 - 0:28:50.880000::Well, that's not what you're saying.
0:28:50.880000 - 0:28:52::So I can't do that.
0:28:54 - 0:28:56.600000::This was Sama-ch-le-t-le-t-le-t-le.
0:28:56.600000 - 0:28:58.160000::I get Jewish with it right away.
0:28:58.160000 - 0:28:59.160000::I can't help that.
0:29:01.200000 - 0:29:04.240000::You should put a Jewish bin on Spanish.
0:29:04.240000 - 0:29:05.600000::Chola.
0:29:05.600000 - 0:29:07.040000::Chola-ch-le.
0:29:09.040000 - 0:29:09.960000::This is so quiet.
0:29:09.960000 - 0:29:11.320000::This is corny, shak.
0:29:11.320000 - 0:29:13.200000::You're Jewish like that.
0:29:13.200000 - 0:29:14.040000::Right.
0:29:14.040000 - 0:29:15.040000::We don't do that.
0:29:15.040000 - 0:29:19.840000::So it's Halloween and people want to be scared to death.
0:29:19.840000 - 0:29:21.640000::Oh, Jesus.
0:29:21.640000 - 0:29:23.720000::They don't need to be people want to be scared to fucking death.
0:29:23.720000 - 0:29:26.520000::Should we tell some scary stories?
0:29:26.520000 - 0:29:30.480000::Dude, we should do a one word at a time.
0:29:30.480000 - 0:29:32.960000::How about some scary stories from our lives?
0:29:32.960000 - 0:29:34::Why don't we do the kids at the age of 20?
0:29:34 - 0:29:37.720000::In 2013, my neighbor died.
0:29:38.040000 - 0:29:43.680000::By being in a car accident.
0:29:43.680000 - 0:29:46.720000::Oh.

0:39:21 - 0:39:27.480000::Everybody better be pouring one piece of chocolate out for fucking Matthew Perry on how I tell you guys something
0:39:28.480000 - 0:39:30.480000::Of course

0:39:36.600000 - 0:39:43.040000::And he signs it off as a madman because he was obsessed with Batman and the caption says the warm water makes me feel good
0:39:43.400000 - 0:39:46.320000::And then caption and then signs off saying I'm madman
0:39:46.960000 - 0:39:50.240000::Eric you need to be a drunk fucking alcoholic detective
0:39:55.240000 - 0:39:59.960000::Okay, no, this is it's truth serum. This is one of the scariest things I was

0:40:00 - 0:40:01.760000::I'm kind of shocked to my core about this.
0:40:01.760000 - 0:40:06.760000::But so last night, I'm on HuffingtonPost.com,
0:40:07.320000 - 0:40:10.480000::doing my, you know, nightly rundown of the news
0:40:10.480000 - 0:40:12.480000::so I can be prepared for the next day to
0:40:12.480000 - 0:40:15.320000::and conversate with everyone at the parties
0:40:15.320000 - 0:40:17.520000::that I'm going to and kind of, you know,
0:40:17.520000 - 0:40:19.040000::keep up to date with everything.
0:40:19.040000 - 0:40:21.960000::And having opinion and formulate.
0:40:21.960000 - 0:40:23.400000::Yeah, what would I want to,
0:40:23.400000 - 0:40:26.120000::what's my opinion was through my independent research,
0:40:26.120000 - 0:40:29.800000::not something that I've bit off of this podcast or something.
0:40:29.800000 - 0:40:33.080000::I'd like to think independently only through looking
0:40:33.080000 - 0:40:33.840000::at HuffingtonPost.
0:40:33.840000 - 0:40:34.680000::Exactly.
0:40:34.680000 - 0:40:37.680000::So I get their opinion and I put my little spin on it first,
0:40:37.680000 - 0:40:39.960000::but I'm not, but I'm not even, anyways,
0:40:39.960000 - 0:40:41.440000::sippington city post.
0:40:41.440000 - 0:40:42.440000::Right.
0:40:42.440000 - 0:40:45.040000::So I see that Matthew Perry's dead, right?
0:40:45.040000 - 0:40:46.040000::Hmm.
0:40:46.040000 - 0:40:47.160000::Present like you guys.
0:40:48.400000 - 0:40:52.600000::And something strange happened where I,
0:40:52.600000 - 0:40:57.600000::the feelings that I had inside were apathy.
0:41:00.760000 - 0:41:01.920000::Is that messed up?
0:41:01.920000 - 0:41:04.680000::I saw this and I said, you don't mean empathy?
0:41:04.680000 - 0:41:05.760000::No, no.
0:41:06.760000 - 0:41:07.760000::You know, apathy.
0:41:07.760000 - 0:41:12.640000::I was like, I wish I could care about this,
0:41:12.640000 - 0:41:14.440000::but I really don't.
0:41:14.440000 - 0:41:15.480000::Is it my fucked up?
0:41:15.480000 - 0:41:18.280000::No, because what you're seeing right now is a world burning
0:41:18.280000 - 0:41:20.880000::at a rate that is very unscathed.
0:41:20.880000 - 0:41:21.400000::Exactly.
0:41:21.400000 - 0:41:24::Things are happening that are so tragic
0:41:24 - 0:41:26.160000::that they are unspeakable.
0:41:26.160000 - 0:41:29.560000::And you see the death of a single 54 year old celebrity
0:41:29.560000 - 0:41:32.280000::man who's seen the high of fame and success.
0:41:32.280000 - 0:41:36.280000::But let me, let me make a case for Matthew Perry right now.
0:41:36.280000 - 0:41:40.120000::Please, this industry is disgusting.
0:41:40.120000 - 0:41:41.040000::OK.
0:41:41.040000 - 0:41:44.800000::This is an industry that milked the talent
0:41:44.800000 - 0:41:48.120000::of a charming handsome young man who was quick-witted,
0:41:48.120000 - 0:41:49.280000::sharp-tongued.
0:41:49.280000 - 0:41:50.560000::He had an amazing person.
0:41:50.560000 - 0:41:56.080000::He brought such presence to a sitcom performance
0:41:56.080000 - 0:41:58.520000::that hadn't been seen since the days of Cheers.
0:41:58.520000 - 0:41:59.280000::OK.
0:41:59.280000 - 0:42:01.320000::He really brought it to the screen.
0:42:01.320000 - 0:42:03.480000::And I loved watching him on friends.
0:42:03.480000 - 0:42:06::But the fame got to be too much.
0:42:06 - 0:42:09.360000::We put too much pressure on these young celebrities
0:42:09.360000 - 0:42:13.760000::to be role models, to be sex icons.
0:42:13.760000 - 0:42:17::And when their bodies change and when they start to break down,
0:42:17 - 0:42:18.520000::where's the support?
0:42:18.520000 - 0:42:20.400000::You know, where's the support?
0:42:20.400000 - 0:42:20.920000::Because it's...
0:42:20.920000 - 0:42:24.080000::It sounds like you're talking to the future version of you.
0:42:24.080000 - 0:42:25.880000::Like, this is a...
0:42:25.880000 - 0:42:26.920000::I feel like you're going to clip...
0:42:26.920000 - 0:42:31.120000::Did somebody clip this and just send it to Eric in like 25 years?
0:42:31.120000 - 0:42:34.240000::Well, Eric used to be the fucking King of the Improv theaters.
0:42:34.240000 - 0:42:36::And now he's had to...
0:42:36 - 0:42:38.680000::He's come up and his body has changed.
0:42:38.680000 - 0:42:40.200000::And people are...
0:42:40.200000 - 0:42:44.320000::He's having to go on stage and beg people to...
0:42:44.320000 - 0:42:45.680000::Well, suck him.
0:42:45.680000 - 0:42:48.680000::You know, last night I was doing a set to a very much...
0:42:48.680000 - 0:42:50.240000::a pretty small house.
0:42:50.240000 - 0:42:53.120000::And I noticed, you know, because I do this with a mic sometimes.
0:42:53.120000 - 0:42:55.240000::I like put it back to them just to get a little feedback.
0:42:55.240000 - 0:42:58.120000::So I feel like I'm something good's happening.
0:42:58.120000 - 0:43:00.360000::And last night our friend came and he was like,
0:43:00.360000 - 0:43:03.160000::you did that last night more than you've ever done it in your life.
0:43:03.160000 - 0:43:05.240000::I feel like after every since.
0:43:05.240000 - 0:43:07.400000::Put the mic back to...
0:43:08.440000 - 0:43:11.400000::But Matthew Perry, man, we know there's a lot of...
0:43:11.400000 - 0:43:13.040000::Even more horrible stuff going on on the planet.
0:43:13.040000 - 0:43:14.120000::But we miss you, man.
0:43:14.120000 - 0:43:16.800000::We're sorry about all that hell that you went through.
0:43:16.800000 - 0:43:17.800000::You see, yeah.
0:43:17.800000 - 0:43:18.800000::And the whole thing.
0:43:18.800000 - 0:43:20.280000::You think he's listening in the after life?
0:43:20.280000 - 0:43:22.280000::Because if the afterlife exists,
0:43:22.280000 - 0:43:26.880000::then certainly you could have access to the...
0:43:26.880000 - 0:43:29.280000::This dimension that we're in right now.
0:43:29.280000 - 0:43:31.200000::So you think there's a lot of ghosts and people...
0:43:31.200000 - 0:43:32.200000::He's too busy doing that.
0:43:32.200000 - 0:43:34.440000::Or listening to this podcast.
0:43:34.440000 - 0:43:39.920000::I think that this dimension becomes just a loading zone.
0:43:39.920000 - 0:43:40.760000::You know what I mean?
0:43:40.760000 - 0:43:42.120000::For the next stage of life.
0:43:42.120000 - 0:43:43.120000::A loading life?
0:43:43.120000 - 0:43:45.880000::You know, it's like when in games when there's a soft load.
0:43:45.880000 - 0:43:49.520000::Like in video games when you have to like squeeze through a crevice.
0:43:49.520000 - 0:43:50.920000::But really, that's the game loading.
0:43:50.960000 - 0:43:51.760000::Yeah.
0:43:51.760000 - 0:43:52.760000::In the background.
0:43:52.760000 - 0:43:54.680000::It's just making you pause for a little bit.
0:43:54.680000 - 0:43:56.840000::Maybe that's what life on Earth is.
0:43:56.840000 - 0:43:57.840000::Damn, I didn't know that.
0:43:57.840000 - 0:43:59.440000::And once we get to the next stage, it all opens up
0:43:59.440000 - 0:44:01.520000::and there's a whole new world.
0:44:01.520000 - 0:44:02.760000::Uh, past this.
0:44:02.760000 - 0:44:03.960000::Who knows?
0:44:03.960000 - 0:44:04.800000::I don't know.
0:44:04.800000 - 0:44:08.320000::It could just be oblivion.
0:44:08.320000 - 0:44:09.320000::Solo.
0:44:09.320000 - 0:44:10.400000::Solo, dole, dole.
0:44:10.400000 - 0:44:11.360000::Would that be so bad?
0:44:11.360000 - 0:44:13.920000::It's so nice to be asleep, isn't it?
0:44:13.920000 - 0:44:15.800000::Yeah, but this isn't sleep.
0:44:15.800000 - 0:44:17.320000::This is something different.
0:44:17.320000 - 0:44:18.960000::Because sleep implies waking up.
0:44:18.960000 - 0:44:20.200000::Sleep implies rest.
0:44:20.240000 - 0:44:22.400000::When I'm asleep, I'm fucking out.
0:44:23.360000 - 0:44:24.040000::All right.
0:44:24.040000 - 0:44:26.560000::What if when you die?
0:44:26.560000 - 0:44:28.400000::What if when you die?
0:44:28.400000 - 0:44:32.800000::Your soul gets connected to the collective consciousness.
0:44:32.800000 - 0:44:39.360000::And you are now a single being that is attached to the infinite amount of
0:44:39.360000 - 0:44:43.840000::souls and realities that have ever existed through this, uh, Earth.
0:44:43.840000 - 0:44:46.680000::I'm talking about all of the animals that have ever exist.
0:44:46.680000 - 0:44:49.320000::Because consciousness is a spectrum.
0:44:49.320000 - 0:44:55.200000::What if you become, uh, one single part and you can feel the, uh, the rhythms
0:44:55.200000 - 0:44:59.680000::and the experiences of all different creatures ever that have ever existed.
0:44:59.680000 - 0:45:00::All.

0:45:00 - 0:45:03.640000::simultaneously in one single seventh dimension.
0:45:03.640000 - 0:45:05.520000::What if that's what happens?
0:45:05.520000 - 0:45:07.320000::You're talking about stimming.
0:45:07.320000 - 0:45:12.480000::It's how stimming is.
0:45:12.480000 - 0:45:14.520000::Yeah, that's what stimming is.
0:45:14.520000 - 0:45:16.320000::We like to think we're so separate
0:45:16.320000 - 0:45:17.960000::that our bodies are so autonomous
0:45:17.960000 - 0:45:20.920000::and so separate from everything.
0:45:20.920000 - 0:45:23.840000::What separates us from the malloc, what is air?
0:45:23.840000 - 0:45:24.680000::You know what I mean?
0:45:24.680000 - 0:45:26.640000::Air is molecules, air is matter.
0:45:26.640000 - 0:45:28::We're connected and what...
0:45:29 - 0:45:31::Well, let me put it this way.
0:45:31 - 0:45:33::What if there's no narrative to it?
0:45:33 - 0:45:34::What if it's not sexy?
0:45:34 - 0:45:35::It's not unsexy.
0:45:35 - 0:45:38::It's just something that we could never have even thought of.
0:45:38 - 0:45:41::What if when you die, you wake up by yourself
0:45:41 - 0:45:42::with six other people
0:45:42 - 0:45:44::and you're all facing in different directions
0:45:44 - 0:45:46::in your inner room sitting facing the wall
0:45:46 - 0:45:48::and your fingers are different colors.
0:45:48 - 0:45:49::Every time you lick your finger,
0:45:49 - 0:45:51::you taste something amazing.
0:45:51 - 0:45:53::And then it switches colors in a new little berry.
0:45:53 - 0:45:55::Fucking futuristic berry grows in your fingers.
0:45:55 - 0:45:57::And you never get fucking answers.
0:45:57 - 0:46:00::You just in this room, something you think is supposed to be back on.
0:46:00 - 0:46:01::Yeah, he looks like he's going back to back.
0:46:01 - 0:46:02::That's what I'm saying.
0:46:02 - 0:46:03::Is this the only...
0:46:03 - 0:46:05::This is going to be much more chaotic
0:46:05 - 0:46:07::than we even fucking realize, man.
0:46:07 - 0:46:09::It might be sucking on a fingerberry's out of you.
0:46:09 - 0:46:12::I used to work at Discovery Education.
0:46:12 - 0:46:14::Do you guys remember when I worked there in Chicago
0:46:14 - 0:46:16::and I was like, yo, I'm making $20 an hour.
0:46:16 - 0:46:18::I can go out to you whenever I want.
0:46:18 - 0:46:19::That's it. Remember that?
0:46:19 - 0:46:20::That was it. Yes.
0:46:20 - 0:46:22::Okay, so I was having to...
0:46:22 - 0:46:25::It was a contract position to full-time hire
0:46:25 - 0:46:27::that didn't choose to re-up my hire.
0:46:27 - 0:46:28::Interesting.
0:46:28 - 0:46:30::They let me go after that first year.
0:46:30 - 0:46:31::That's business, man.
0:46:31 - 0:46:35::But basically, I was editing educational content all day.
0:46:35 - 0:46:39::And one of the series that I edited for the classroom
0:46:39 - 0:46:43::was this like, secrets of the universe type thing.
0:46:43 - 0:46:47::And it was a huge office at the top of this building
0:46:47 - 0:46:49::overlooking like, Michigan.
0:46:49 - 0:46:50::Wow.
0:46:50 - 0:46:52::And all of my coworkers were on the other...
0:46:52 - 0:46:55::For some reason, they put me on a solo
0:46:55 - 0:46:57::on like the sales side of the office.
0:46:57 - 0:46:59::And all the sales people were always on the road.
0:46:59 - 0:47:01::So I never had anybody next to me.
0:47:01 - 0:47:02::It was just me alone.
0:47:02 - 0:47:03::And I would turn the lights off.
0:47:03 - 0:47:07::So I sat in a dark office all day editing these things,
0:47:07 - 0:47:08::losing my mind.
0:47:08 - 0:47:13::And one of the episodes was about the reality of...
0:47:13 - 0:47:16::Like the reality of nature, whatever.
0:47:16 - 0:47:18::And the scientist comes on.
0:47:18 - 0:47:20::She's like, our senses are trying to make sense
0:47:20 - 0:47:22::of what's going on around us.
0:47:22 - 0:47:23::You know what I mean?
0:47:23 - 0:47:25::But the true reality of nature is so incomprehensible
0:47:25 - 0:47:28::and so opposite of what we're seeing right now.
0:47:28 - 0:47:30::I'm not even putting in the right words,
0:47:30 - 0:47:32::but I remember having like really a crisis
0:47:32 - 0:47:34::when she said this in this office.
0:47:34 - 0:47:36::Yeah, I'm not paying attention to what you're saying.
0:47:36 - 0:47:37::I don't get what I'm saying.
0:47:37 - 0:47:38::I'm sorry.
0:47:38 - 0:47:40::What did you just move on?
0:47:40 - 0:47:41::Did you say it's just like that?
0:47:41 - 0:47:42::What did you say?
0:47:42 - 0:47:43::Okay.
0:47:43 - 0:47:44::Well, so funny,
0:47:44 - 0:47:47::because I was like really trying to connect with you guys.
0:47:47 - 0:47:49::Okay, well, we're doing a podcast now.
0:47:49 - 0:47:51::So save it for the fuck you.
0:47:51 - 0:47:52::Save it for the road trip.
0:47:52 - 0:47:54::I was fucking stupid, Eric.
0:47:54 - 0:47:56::Like, do you know what you're right?
0:47:56 - 0:47:58::Like, what you're right?
0:47:58 - 0:47:59::Can we do the...
0:47:59 - 0:48:01::We do this very story or whatever.
0:48:01 - 0:48:04::Hey, we forgot to compliment each other.
0:48:04 - 0:48:06::Maybe that'll be the joyous experience at that.
0:48:06 - 0:48:08::And because we always ramp up.
0:48:08 - 0:48:09::Because we get more joyous...
0:48:09 - 0:48:10::If you haven't noticed,
0:48:10 - 0:48:13::we'd get more joyous as the podcast goes on.
0:48:13 - 0:48:14::Yeah.
0:48:14 - 0:48:16::And that's something that a lot of people have caught on.
0:48:16 - 0:48:18::It's kind of a thing behind the scenes.
0:48:18 - 0:48:20::But this is something we talk about.
0:48:20 - 0:48:23::Can we experience more joy as the podcast is going on?
0:48:23 - 0:48:25::It's a ramp that goes up an hour.
0:48:25 - 0:48:27::And you're on that rollercoaster with us.
0:48:27 - 0:48:29::And at the beginning, it's dark.
0:48:29 - 0:48:30::I know you feel it.
0:48:30 - 0:48:31::You're like, oh, where's this going?
0:48:31 - 0:48:34::By the end, we are ramping up to joyous...
0:48:34 - 0:48:36::Joyous exploration.
0:48:36 - 0:48:37::Enjoyment.
0:48:37 - 0:48:38::And in that state of ecstasy,
0:48:38 - 0:48:41::one, two of the members might stab the other one in the back.
0:48:41 - 0:48:42::And there's no problem.
0:48:42 - 0:48:43::I mean, it's just like,
0:48:43 - 0:48:44::then we're back.
0:48:44 - 0:48:45::You know,
0:48:45 - 0:48:46::that might be real.
0:48:46 - 0:48:48::You know, it's a rail sum podcast, but not this one.
0:48:48 - 0:48:52::Did they stab him or did he back up into the knife?
0:48:52 - 0:48:53::All right.
0:48:53 - 0:48:54::Yep.
0:48:54 - 0:48:55::Gotcha.
0:48:55 - 0:48:57::Oh, hey, it'd be stabbed.
0:48:57 - 0:48:59::It depends where.
0:48:59 - 0:49:02::All right.
0:49:02 - 0:49:04::What are we talking about?
0:49:04 - 0:49:06::Should we tell a scary story?
0:49:06 - 0:49:09::Let's tell one scary fucking story real quick.
0:49:09 - 0:49:12::Let's try to tell the scariest fucking story we can tell.
0:49:12 - 0:49:13::Wait, can we go around Robin?
0:49:13 - 0:49:16.160000::everybody does one sense about a new made up story.
0:49:16.160000 - 0:49:16.760000::It browns.
0:49:16.760000 - 0:49:17.280000::No.
0:49:18.240000 - 0:49:18.560000::All right.
0:49:18.560000 - 0:49:19.880000::And be as scary as possible.
0:49:19.880000 - 0:49:20.520000::Don't be funny.
0:49:21.040000 - 0:49:21.840000::I will start.
0:49:22.240000 - 0:49:23::I'm going to start.
0:49:26.240000 - 0:49:31.640000::There was a cabin in the middle of upstate New York.
0:49:33.560000 - 0:49:41.120000::It was late October in three single men and five.
0:49:41.600000 - 0:49:46.520000::You know, five single women all were all up there.
0:49:48.440000 - 0:49:50.560000::And they were having a cabin trip.
0:49:50.560000 - 0:49:51.440000::One sentence area.
0:49:51.440000 - 0:49:51.840000::OK.
0:49:51.840000 - 0:49:52.840000::One sentence.
0:49:52.840000 - 0:49:53.600000::One sentence.
0:49:57.160000 - 0:49:59.640000::They were about to eat.

0:50:00 - 0:50:07.360000::A delicious piece of pizza together when suddenly they heard a knock at the door.
0:50:08.240000 - 0:50:10.560000::That's my sense. Oh, I thought I was going to pick it up.
0:50:10.560000 - 0:50:15.120000::Sliquely at the door. There was a knock at the door.
0:50:16.320000 - 0:50:23.920000::And who was at the door? A old man with a lantern.
0:50:24.880000 - 0:50:30.240000::And he said to the three single men and five single women.
0:50:30.240000 - 0:50:31.280000::How many senses?
0:50:31.760000 - 0:50:33.520000::Sorry, go ahead. Take over.
0:50:33.840000 - 0:50:40.160000::Have you got enough oil for the night?
0:50:42 - 0:50:43.280000::It's going to be a cold one.
0:50:46 - 0:50:50.560000::And he took a knife out from behind his back and said,
0:50:50.960000 - 0:50:56.800000::I'm going to slice all of you right now.
0:50:59.040000 - 0:51:01.520000::And then he put the knife. I'm sorry, Nate, go ahead.
0:51:01.520000 - 0:51:08.640000::And then one of the single males took out one of their weapons that on the way up from the trip,
0:51:08.640000 - 0:51:13.120000::they said, some of the other single people were like, you shouldn't have a gun.
0:51:13.120000 - 0:51:16.800000::Like, why are you bringing your gun? Oh, it came in handy this time.
0:51:16.880000 - 0:51:20::Now what are you saying about the gun before?
0:51:20 - 0:51:21.600000::Right. Because it's actually saving you're like,
0:51:21.600000 - 0:51:24.720000::she's the guy in the fucking head.
0:51:28.720000 - 0:51:30.480000::I ain't got any fucking died.
0:51:31.600000 - 0:51:33.760000::And then they had to bury his ass.
0:51:34.560000 - 0:51:36.880000::And then it was back to parting.
0:51:38.480000 - 0:51:42.320000::And then they heard a knock, but this time it was a coming from the door.
0:51:43.360000 - 0:51:46.400000::This time it was coming from inside the guy with the guns.
0:51:46.880000 - 0:51:47.840000::Fucking head.
0:51:50.320000 - 0:51:53.600000::I feel like that's a great place just to leave it for a cliffhanger.
0:51:53.600000 - 0:51:54.160000::What do you think?
0:51:54.720000 - 0:51:55.520000::Right. We'll do.
0:51:55.520000 - 0:51:56.640000::Oh, yeah. Next year we can pick it up.
0:51:56.640000 - 0:51:59.360000::Next year we'll show six years down the road.
0:51:59.360000 - 0:52:03.120000::We continue. This is everybody's favorite segment that there's no way they fast forward it through that.
0:52:03.120000 - 0:52:04.160000::And they
0:52:05.280000 - 0:52:07.520000::off your fast forwarding at 54 minutes in.
0:52:07.520000 - 0:52:08.400000::You might get rid of that.
0:52:12.160000 - 0:52:12.960000::That was incredible.
0:52:12.960000 - 0:52:15.680000::You say what gave us joy and go shopping?
0:52:15.680000 - 0:52:18.240000::I think so. We should say what gave us some joy.
0:52:18.240000 - 0:52:19.920000::What is everybody going to be for Halloween?
0:52:19.920000 - 0:52:23.360000::Well, I got this damn wig and I got these vampire
0:52:24.320000 - 0:52:27.120000::fangs that had good reviews.
0:52:28.080000 - 0:52:28.480000::Okay.
0:52:29.600000 - 0:52:30.320000::It looks good.
0:52:30.320000 - 0:52:32::I'm here, but they don't stand.
0:52:32 - 0:52:35.440000::Hold up. The reviews on Amazon are fucking.
0:52:35.440000 - 0:52:36.640000::We can no longer trust.
0:52:36.640000 - 0:52:41.200000::This was my, this is my gripe because I looked at the reviews more in depth after I bought them.
0:52:41.200000 - 0:52:44.560000::And that's clear that these were AI generated.
0:52:45.200000 - 0:52:45.680000::Clear.
0:52:45.680000 - 0:52:46.640000::What can we trust?
0:52:46.640000 - 0:52:50.160000::We can only trust to this point is word of mouth.
0:52:50.160000 - 0:52:50.640000::We can trust.
0:52:50.640000 - 0:52:51.200000::We can only trust.
0:52:52.160000 - 0:52:55.280000::You have to, you have to, if you're getting something,
0:52:56.240000 - 0:53:01.680000::you have to ask your friends for personal recommendation for something because
0:53:01.680000 - 0:53:04.960000::we've gotten to the point where we can't trust any of these fucking reviews.
0:53:04.960000 - 0:53:05.920000::They're all bots.
0:53:06.480000 - 0:53:10.080000::Anything that has a 4.8 rating on Amazon is fucking trash.
0:53:10.080000 - 0:53:12.880000::In fact, if it has the higher the rating, the worse the product is.
0:53:13.600000 - 0:53:17.360000::Okay, because they have to make up for how bad it is with all the AI bots there,
0:53:17.360000 - 0:53:19.120000::fucking reviewing this shit.
0:53:19.120000 - 0:53:20.240000::And I've had enough.
0:53:21.120000 - 0:53:21.600000::Enough.
0:53:21.600000 - 0:53:22.800000::You've got to be a doctor to anybody.
0:53:22.800000 - 0:53:23.600000::Amazon someday.
0:53:23.600000 - 0:53:24.240000::I swear to God.
0:53:25.360000 - 0:53:26.640000::I'd watch the f**k that.
0:53:26.640000 - 0:53:27.520000::I swear to God.
0:53:27.520000 - 0:53:29.440000::I love to take them down.
0:53:29.440000 - 0:53:29.920000::I love you.
0:53:29.920000 - 0:53:31.680000::I want to sandwich right now.
0:53:33.200000 - 0:53:33.600000::All right.
0:53:33.600000 - 0:53:36.080000::So what gave me joy this week?
0:53:36.640000 - 0:53:42.320000::Well, oh, I promised myself I wouldn't let myself do food every time,
0:53:42.320000 - 0:53:46.720000::but yesterday we had, we went and got some Guatemalan food.
0:53:47.280000 - 0:53:49.600000::And Jack, I know this shit will be right up your alley.

0:53:53.200000 - 0:53:55.840000::disgusting, horrible fall heat.
0:53:55.840000 - 0:53:57.840000::It shouldn't be that hot with leaves on the ground.
0:53:58.080000 - 0:53:58.960000::You know what I mean?
0:53:58.960000 - 0:54:02.480000::And you want to be wearing your new sweater, whatever, and your getting all sweaty.
0:54:02.480000 - 0:54:03.120000::That's the worst.
0:54:03.840000 - 0:54:05.040000::Al Gore warned us.
0:54:05.040000 - 0:54:05.760000::Yeah, he did.

0:54:11.920000 - 0:54:12.560000::Yeah, I was.
0:54:12.560000 - 0:54:15.680000::This soup was one of the best soup I ever had in my life.

0:54:18.080000 - 0:54:20.320000::when's the last time you heated up soup at 2 a.m.
0:54:20.320000 - 0:54:21.920000::and ate it down like it was a breito?
0:54:22.880000 - 0:54:25.520000::I did last night because it was so, every bite was delicious.

0:55:24.560000 - 0:55:25.560000::Sandwiches.
0:55:25.560000 - 0:55:26.560000::I'm trying to figure out how to talk about it.

1:02:15.120000 - 1:02:17.040000::But that gave me joy even though my girlfriend said,
1:02:17.040000 - 1:02:19.080000::when are you going to start eating like an adult?
