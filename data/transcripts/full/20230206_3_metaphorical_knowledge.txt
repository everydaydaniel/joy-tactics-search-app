0:03:40.800000 - 0:03:44.200000::Just kind of couldn't grab couldn't grapple with the idea of

0:09:53.800000 - 0:09:56::even if it's not nice, we're gonna tell you
0:09:56 - 0:09:57.600000::how we motherfucking feel.
0:09:57.600000 - 0:09:58.760000::We're real about it.
0:09:58.760000 - 0:09:59.600000::Because we're real.
0:09:59.600000 - 0:10:00.440000::That's what.

0:10:00 - 0:10:03.840000::But I've been to every neighborhood in New York multiple times.
0:10:03.840000 - 0:10:07.840000::And in the last weeks since this shit dropped.
0:10:07.840000 - 0:10:09.600000::Oh shit, what's that here?
0:10:09.600000 - 0:10:12.160000::I hear blasting from that SUV.
0:10:12.160000 - 0:10:13.320000::Broom.
0:10:13.320000 - 0:10:14.560000::Beginning of joy tactics.
0:10:14.560000 - 0:10:18.120000::It's the Nate going off on some crazy astangent.
0:10:18.120000 - 0:10:19.240000::We're in Bronx.
0:10:19.240000 - 0:10:21.600000::It's Jack singing a song on the podcast.
0:10:21.600000 - 0:10:22.600000::Broom.
0:10:22.600000 - 0:10:23.440000::Tribeca.
0:10:23.440000 - 0:10:26.280000::They like me and Tribeca the most.
0:10:26.280000 - 0:10:28.320000::This has started as a podcast.
0:10:28.320000 - 0:10:32.440000::And I was like, oh, you know, we'll just upload this to Spotify, whatever.
0:10:32.440000 - 0:10:34.360000::Like it's just me and my friends hanging out.
0:10:34.360000 - 0:10:41.160000::But I am so shocked because this is now a movement that we've created.
0:10:41.160000 - 0:10:46.960000::It's no longer this thing that we started as, which we had zero expectations.
0:10:46.960000 - 0:10:50.120000::You always hear people, oh, what George Lucas, what do you think of Star Wars?
0:10:50.120000 - 0:10:52.360000::I would just have him fun making a movie.
0:10:52.360000 - 0:10:54.200000::I didn't know it would end up like this.
0:10:54.200000 - 0:10:55.360000::And that's how we feel.
0:10:55.360000 - 0:10:59.200000::We were just like, oh, maybe one, two people will listen to this.
0:10:59.200000 - 0:11:05.640000::But we have created such a solid movement that is dipping and zipping into the fucking
0:11:05.640000 - 0:11:07.640000::zeitgeist where people are kind of.
0:11:07.640000 - 0:11:09.120000::Tipping and zipping.
0:11:09.120000 - 0:11:10.640000::People are feeling different.
0:11:10.640000 - 0:11:15.560000::I feel like everyone has kind of changed and has been affected by this.
0:11:15.560000 - 0:11:19.120000::Whether they're listening or not, they have been, because we know somebody that's
0:11:19.120000 - 0:11:23.920000::listened to, you know, you're probably four degrees away from somebody who's listening
0:11:23.920000 - 0:11:26.840000::to a joy-tactor set this point statistically in a little bit.
0:11:26.840000 - 0:11:27.840000::Zero.
0:11:27.840000 - 0:11:29.200000::Literally I'm walking down the street in New York.
0:11:29.200000 - 0:11:31.760000::I'm thinking about going to get potbellies to try and do sandwich.
0:11:31.760000 - 0:11:32.760000::I didn't try it yet.
0:11:32.760000 - 0:11:33.760000::I've tried almost everything.
0:11:33.760000 - 0:11:34.760000::But then this guy comes up to me.
0:11:34.760000 - 0:11:37.280000::He starts putting, tucking my head into his shirt from the bottom.
0:11:37.280000 - 0:11:41.320000::You know when you lift your shirt up and bag them and I'm thinking, what the hell is this?
0:11:41.320000 - 0:11:42.320000::I look up.
0:11:42.320000 - 0:11:45.320000::It's a hair and a, all the way up.
0:11:45.320000 - 0:11:46.800000::Look at what the hell.
0:11:46.800000 - 0:11:48.920000::It's Mayor Eric Adams of New York.
0:11:48.920000 - 0:11:51.520000::And he's trying to tuck me into his shirt from the bottom, kidnap style.
0:11:51.520000 - 0:11:53.120000::And I'm like, what the fuck are you doing, man?
0:11:53.120000 - 0:11:54.120000::Do I know you?
0:11:54.120000 - 0:11:55.800000::Oh snap, it's the president or the mayor.
0:11:55.800000 - 0:11:57.360000::And he goes, yeah, dude, I want you.
0:11:57.360000 - 0:11:58.360000::I'm tired.
0:11:58.360000 - 0:12:00.880000::This is, I need you to do this because you're the most suited for it.
0:12:00.880000 - 0:12:04.120000::So I'm trying to put you in my clothes so I can slide out.
0:12:04.120000 - 0:12:05.920000::That's how crazy the podcast is getting on.
0:12:05.920000 - 0:12:06.920000::Oh, man.
0:12:06.920000 - 0:12:09.040000::This should be subsidized by the government.
0:12:09.040000 - 0:12:16.200000::I didn't tell you guys this, but I recently was at a party with 99% models.
0:12:16.200000 - 0:12:19.880000::And two of the most famous models came over to me and I was like, chill, chill.
0:12:19.880000 - 0:12:22.200000::I got a girlfriend and chill.
0:12:22.200000 - 0:12:27.760000::And they say to me, hey, would you, they're like, do you know what we dream of every day?
0:12:27.760000 - 0:12:29.320000::It's a male and female model, by the way.
0:12:29.320000 - 0:12:30.480000::This isn't just women.
0:12:30.480000 - 0:12:32.720000::It's all genders love the fuck out of us.
0:12:32.720000 - 0:12:34.880000::And they're like, do you know what?
0:12:34.880000 - 0:12:35.880000::We would love so much.
0:12:35.880000 - 0:12:37.640000::And I'm like, what chill?
0:12:37.640000 - 0:12:39.240000::First off, chill.
0:12:39.240000 - 0:12:44.960000::They said we would love if you guys could be, if we could get you recording in our bedroom.
0:12:44.960000 - 0:12:45.960000::Whoa.
0:12:45.960000 - 0:12:46.960000::Oh shit.
0:12:46.960000 - 0:12:47.960000::What the fuck?
0:12:47.960000 - 0:12:48.960000::The podcast.
0:12:49.680000 - 0:12:52.920000::They want to have sex.
0:12:52.920000 - 0:12:54.560000::That's something I'm so comfortable with.
0:12:54.560000 - 0:13:02.400000::If the three of us were in a five-sum with two models, let me just say, that'll be the most natural I've ever felt in my life.
0:13:02.400000 - 0:13:05.560000::I would definitely be involved in that type of shit with you guys.
0:13:05.560000 - 0:13:11.040000::Yeah, that would be awesome if we were all, you know, whatever, single ever.
0:13:11.040000 - 0:13:11.880000::Which we're not.
0:13:11.880000 - 0:13:12.880000::Attention ladies.
0:13:12.880000 - 0:13:13.880000::Attention ladies.
0:13:13.880000 - 0:13:14.400000::Stop.
0:13:14.400000 - 0:13:15.200000::Stop.
0:13:15.200000 - 0:13:16.040000::What you're doing?
0:13:16.040000 - 0:13:16.880000::Stop right now.
0:13:16.880000 - 0:13:21.280000::Stop DMing us because we're not going to fucking look at it because guess what?
0:13:21.280000 - 0:13:23.840000::I'm running the most loyal fucking people on the planet.
0:13:23.840000 - 0:13:28::I don't even think about anything else besides my girl.
0:13:28 - 0:13:29.840000::And that's why the ladies rock with me.
0:13:29.840000 - 0:13:33.320000::That's why I'm one of the best partners and boyfriends on the fucking planet.
0:13:33.320000 - 0:13:35.840000::Because when you're with me, it's a laser focus.
0:13:35.840000 - 0:13:37.560000::It's just about you, baby.
0:13:37.560000 - 0:13:39.280000::And it about anybody else.
0:13:39.280000 - 0:13:40.400000::But you and me right now.
0:13:40.400000 - 0:13:42.800000::This is this is this nice about you right now.

0:13:43.920000 - 0:13:46.640000::I'm going to make you feel special, you know?
0:13:46.720000 - 0:13:47.640000::Let me quote Metallica.
0:13:47.640000 - 0:13:48.640000::Dream on.
0:13:48.640000 - 0:13:49.640000::Dream on.
0:13:49.640000 - 0:13:50.640000::Yeah.
0:13:50.640000 - 0:13:51.640000::If you're listening.

0:13:52.640000 - 0:13:55.120000::I think you think about it.
0:13:55.120000 - 0:13:59.960000::But we also understand that a lot of people out there would love to date us, to even
0:13:59.960000 - 0:14:02.520000::be around us desperately.
0:14:02.520000 - 0:14:04::And we get that.
0:14:04 - 0:14:07.760000::And, you know, I would too if I was in your position.
0:14:07.760000 - 0:14:12.200000::But it's just the case right now that we're all taken and happily.
0:14:12.200000 - 0:14:13.200000::Yeah.
0:14:13.200000 - 0:14:16.600000::And you guys know that and that's why you're not saying it to us.
0:14:16.600000 - 0:14:17.600000::Right.
0:14:17.600000 - 0:14:18.600000::Out of respect.
0:14:18.600000 - 0:14:19.600000::Right.
0:14:19.600000 - 0:14:20.600000::Right.

0:14:28.600000 - 0:14:29.600000::But here's the thing.
0:14:29.600000 - 0:14:30.600000::It doesn't mean that we all can't have friends like celebrity friends.
0:14:30.600000 - 0:14:31.600000::The poor.
0:14:31.600000 - 0:14:32.600000::Like we want to be still meeting and hanging out with everybody.
0:14:32.600000 - 0:14:33.600000::But like just don't expect.

0:17:22.880000 - 0:17:26.960000::I'm walking around New York City. I'm trying to go to the pot belly to see what kind of sandwiches new sandwiches
0:17:26.960000 - 0:17:30.880000::I haven't tried yet there this guy comes up to me and starts putting my head in the bottom of the shirt
0:17:32 - 0:17:34::All of a sudden I go
0:17:35.040000 - 0:17:37.040000::All of a sudden look up
0:17:38.800000 - 0:17:40.800000::I
0:17:41.040000 - 0:17:45.280000::Been shooting a lot of grape flavored ice cube bubble them. It's okay, man
0:17:45.840000 - 0:17:51.760000::But that was so that was such a good riff that I think you could have even gone twice with it and people would have been okay
0:17:52 - 0:17:56::And not turned off or like you know like shutting that with the lottery
0:17:56.320000 - 0:18:01.120000::Like sometimes sometimes you know you hear a song twice. Why can't you hear it like a riff
0:18:02.080000 - 0:18:08::Twice, you know, you're hitly you're listening to all the lights by Kanye West over and over again
0:18:08.240000 - 0:18:15.200000::Well, why aren't you listening to this episode like five 10 15 times, you know what I'm saying which actually a lot of people are
0:18:16.080000 - 0:18:19.280000::The real heads do because if your brain is wired
0:18:20.080000 - 0:18:22.320000::More advancedly, which I think a lot of people listening
0:18:22.960000 - 0:18:26.560000::You know that about yourself. Let's be honest. Yeah, you will be able to
0:18:28 - 0:18:34.720000::Like regular intellectual sentences get stuck in your head in the way that a lay person maybe like a song a song
0:18:34.800000 - 0:18:39.440000::That's on the radio gets stuck in their head for you. It's like oh four score and seven years ago
0:18:40.160000 - 0:18:42.160000::That's so catchy. Oh
0:18:42.160000 - 0:18:44.640000::Treat everybody the way you want to be treated. That's a bob
0:18:45.600000 - 0:18:47.600000::right so
0:18:48.800000 - 0:18:51.600000::That's what I'm just saying now
0:18:52.640000 - 0:18:54.640000::I'm done
0:18:54.800000 - 0:19:01.840000::I wanted to quickly shoot off of the you brought up the bubble gum in your tune. Yeah, and we were getting drinks
0:19:02.480000 - 0:19:09.200000::With a group about a week ago and I offered somebody some gum and he said no thanks. I don't want cancer
0:19:09.600000 - 0:19:17.040000::Yo really and I said what info do you have that I I'm not aware of because I chew this shit like
0:19:18.240000 - 0:19:24::Every day it makes my breath smell good as fuck and I like the way it fills on my teeth
0:19:24.880000 - 0:19:28.320000::And I didn't ask him that but I haven't looked it up on Google because I'm too afraid
0:19:29.120000 - 0:19:32.640000::If anybody listening is a doctor or nurse or
0:19:33.360000 - 0:19:35.360000::hospice nurse
0:19:36.400000 - 0:19:42.240000::Let us know if you know anything about gum way in cancer is the person didn't respond when you asked him that
0:19:42.720000 - 0:19:46.480000::I didn't answer. I just said. I mean this is the type of coward. I am I said oh
0:19:46.720000 - 0:19:50.160000::Oh, then I popped the piece of five gum in my mouth. Well, dude
0:19:50.560000 - 0:19:55.360000::That's a great response to any question that anybody asked you know things. I don't want cancer
0:19:55.360000 - 0:19:58.240000::Yeah, you what are you doing now you want to chill nothing?

0:20:00 - 0:20:08.160000::about is that I think that in, let's say 25 years, I think we are going to be a generation
0:20:08.160000 - 0:20:14.960000::that will have the cure to any type of disease. So I'm saying if you're smoking six right now,
0:20:16 - 0:20:21.600000::you're good. Like go ahead, get by another pack, double up the smoking, you know what I'm saying?
0:20:21.600000 - 0:20:26.800000::Because it's going to, it's going to be all good once you're about 65 years old and the,
0:20:27.520000 - 0:20:32.480000::the adverse effects of smoking are about to hit you. There's going to be some, you know, type of
0:20:32.480000 - 0:20:39.840000::robot like CRISPR drone, AIR is going to be able to cure whatever you got going down. So
0:20:40.400000 - 0:20:44.880000::doesn't it seem like you just get dry as you get older and that's the problem? Maybe people
0:20:44.880000 - 0:20:50::just get more wet. Like when I think about like what's, because aging is a disease, isn't it?
0:20:50 - 0:20:56.160000::That's the disease. Yes. It's the, finally, we're categorizing it appropriately.
0:20:57.760000 - 0:21:03.680000::It's a disease. It's not good for you. It is a disease that I'm suffering from.
0:21:04.640000 - 0:21:09.520000::Like it's a crippling. I feel like I have a kind of a crazier version of aging than most.
0:21:10.480000 - 0:21:15.920000::Well, it's funny because your body ages and they say that's a bad thing, but your brain ages
0:21:15.920000 - 0:21:22.320000::and it's called wisdom. Well, oh, and your soul ages and that's called storytelling of the
0:21:22.320000 - 0:21:27.440000::wisdom. Well, Eric, speak a little bit about wisdom real quick. What does that mean to you?
0:21:27.440000 - 0:21:33.120000::That order because something tells me that something tells me that you have sort of a
0:21:33.920000 - 0:21:41.040000::opinion about wisdom and what that means to people as a human and what that does to you as you
0:21:41.040000 - 0:21:46.480000::age and get older and what you can contribute to others with that so-called wisdom.
0:21:47.440000 - 0:21:49.360000::That's so interesting. You say that.
0:21:50.080000 - 0:21:54.400000::Well, I'll speak on it for a second. Wisdom to me just means seasoning.
0:21:55.760000 - 0:22:01.040000::And let me expand on that. So you get born in this life. Everybody's born a baked potato, right?
0:22:03.040000 - 0:22:07.920000::Smiling because I love the fuck out of baked potatoes. But you're born out of plain potato,
0:22:08.640000 - 0:22:13.840000::right? And as you get, oh, you might have been born a rich potato or a poor potato.
0:22:13.840000 - 0:22:19.120000::The poor potatoes, they get whatever seasoning is around. So it's a little bit of old-ass
0:22:19.920000 - 0:22:25.520000::salt that they use on the roads, some dirt that you're mixing some horrible
0:22:25.520000 - 0:22:31.040000::shit, tasting shit in there. The rich people get different type of seasoning. All the expensive spices.
0:22:32.880000 - 0:22:36.080000::And let me see where I'm going with this. What I wanted to cover from there is-
0:22:37.440000 - 0:22:38.080000::What are you saying?
0:22:38.800000 - 0:22:42.800000::So I wanted to somehow get into this. Rich people are more wise.
0:22:43.520000 - 0:22:50.080000::In World War One, we send all the boys off to maybe one of the most violent-
0:22:50.080000 - 0:22:52.960000::Eric Panicking right now, like with the metaphor of a traditional-
0:22:52.960000 - 0:22:58.800000::May just give you the biggest alley of all time, like a 45-second long intro for you to call
0:22:58.800000 - 0:23:05.440000::with the sickest shit. Whatever Eric brings up World War One, he is panicking, he's spinning his
0:23:05.440000 - 0:23:11.920000::wheel back. He's like back in World War One. Eric just right back to 2015 Chicago.
0:23:14.240000 - 0:23:18.240000::Well, I didn't want to say like the people who have seen the worship and the planet,
0:23:18.240000 - 0:23:23.920000::the death and the violence and human nature and evil and blood and their friends ripped apart
0:23:23.920000 - 0:23:30.480000::in front of them, they are seeing the most realist part of humanity. And when they come back,
0:23:30.480000 - 0:23:37.120000::they're shell-shocked, they're broken, they don't want to be in some cases alive anymore.
0:23:37.760000 - 0:23:41.920000::And maybe they're the wisest people and everybody else is just dumb.
0:23:43.680000 - 0:23:50.720000::So you're saying that sort of through the trials and tribulations of suffering, pain, disease,
0:23:50.720000 - 0:23:58.080000::war, famine, that actually contributes to the amount of wisdom and knowledge that you have and
0:23:58.080000 - 0:24:04.640000::that you can share and give to the world. So in a way, the pain and the struggle is
0:24:05.440000 - 0:24:10.960000::transcends and transmutes, which I love that word, transmutes. What's that mean?
0:24:10.960000 - 0:24:15.680000::It means you take something and change it into something different and more different and positive
0:24:15.680000 - 0:24:22.560000::than it was in the, for instance, if you're feeling sad as fuck, you can transmute that energy
0:24:22.560000 - 0:24:29.520000::using ancient techniques into happiness and having fun. But I won't give away those secrets.
0:24:29.520000 - 0:24:37.120000::You'll have to take my e-course for that, which I'm putting out on my website and making a lot
0:24:37.120000 - 0:24:42.560000::of money from, by the way, way more than this shit than this fucking podcast. All right, man.
0:24:46 - 0:24:49.920000::I think we're pretty much on the same page, but what I finally want to say is this.
0:24:49.920000 - 0:24:55.280000::People have seen the worst of the world and who end up hopeless and broken.
0:24:56.080000 - 0:24:59.920000::I think they're the wisest because they see life out really is.

0:25:00 - 0:25:03.400000::which is just ultimately a sad, sad affair.
0:25:03.400000 - 0:25:05.600000::And life is a terminal illness.
0:25:05.600000 - 0:25:10.400000::And to be distracted by TV and video games and good dinners,
0:25:10.400000 - 0:25:13.200000::you're just putting off the inevitable,
0:25:13.200000 - 0:25:18::which is a long, cold death and return to nothingness.
0:25:18 - 0:25:19::Wow.
0:25:19 - 0:25:20::Good God.
0:25:20 - 0:25:23.600000::And you kind of said something also about
0:25:23.600000 - 0:25:25.200000::how sometimes they want to kill themselves
0:25:25.200000 - 0:25:26.200000::and that's the right thing.
0:25:26.200000 - 0:25:28::Did you say that?
0:25:29 - 0:25:30::I didn't say that's right.
0:25:30 - 0:25:34::I just said, I, no, no, I mean, we'll bleep all of that shit.
0:25:34 - 0:25:37::Look, we're going to talk about some dark topics on this podcast
0:25:37 - 0:25:41::because a lot of dark topics don't get even talked about
0:25:41 - 0:25:43::in the mainstream media.
0:25:43 - 0:25:45::That's what pieces me and I look on.
0:25:45 - 0:25:46::And they are so complex.
0:25:46 - 0:25:47::Oh.
0:25:47 - 0:25:50::And there's so many different, different points that you can,
0:25:50 - 0:25:53::you know, talk about these issues and not all everyone's
0:25:53 - 0:25:54::talk about.
0:25:54 - 0:25:57::And what we're trying to do is just put out these things
0:25:57 - 0:26:00::and saying, hey, we can talk about this because when we talk
0:26:00 - 0:26:04::about it, people learn more, people grow more, you understand
0:26:04 - 0:26:06::these issues a little bit more.
0:26:06 - 0:26:10::So let's stop being afraid to talk about dark shit and crazy,
0:26:10 - 0:26:15::crazy, maybe evil subjects and parts of humanity that
0:26:15 - 0:26:16::we're not as proud of.
0:26:16 - 0:26:19::But let's talk about it because that's how we change the world
0:26:19 - 0:26:21::is through dialogue and conversation.
0:26:21 - 0:26:24::If I see a Republican on the street, I'm saying, hey,
0:26:24 - 0:26:26::man, what's up?
0:26:26 - 0:26:27::Like, let's chat.
0:26:27 - 0:26:29::Let's let's let's let's let's chop it up.
0:26:29 - 0:26:30::Like, I'm not afraid of you.
0:26:30 - 0:26:31::Yeah.
0:26:31 - 0:26:33::Let's see what kind of commonalities we have in you because
0:26:33 - 0:26:35::I bet there's a lot more similarities than there are differences
0:26:35 - 0:26:36::in the end.
0:26:36 - 0:26:42::Because you put people in the dirt, you put feelings and emotions
0:26:42 - 0:26:47::and death and violence in the dirt or in a dark cellar.
0:26:47 - 0:26:48::Guess what happens to it?
0:26:48 - 0:26:50::Just like what happens to alcohol.
0:26:50 - 0:26:51::It grows.
0:26:51 - 0:26:52::It grows.
0:26:52 - 0:26:55::It grows and it becomes a funky and disgusting.
0:26:55 - 0:26:58::But if you put that shit in the light of day,
0:26:58 - 0:27:02::you put violence and beatings, whatever,
0:27:02 - 0:27:03::right into the sunlight.
0:27:03 - 0:27:05::Guess what happens?
0:27:05 - 0:27:11::It fades like a magazine in a window display of a fucked-up
0:27:11 - 0:27:13::store gets all faded.
0:27:13 - 0:27:15::Eric, can I just say that's right.
0:27:15 - 0:27:17::That's a good right.
0:27:17 - 0:27:18::Yeah, go ahead.
0:27:18 - 0:27:21::Can I just say Eric, dude, your metaphors are on fleek today.
0:27:21 - 0:27:26::The way that, well, I'm serious right now, dude.
0:27:26 - 0:27:29::We are taking subjects that people typically don't want to
0:27:29 - 0:27:32::hear about or don't, can't even process in their brains
0:27:32 - 0:27:33::emotionally.
0:27:33 - 0:27:37::And we are using this little thing called a metaphor to help
0:27:37 - 0:27:39::you understand it in a different light.
0:27:39 - 0:27:42::Because sometimes when people see something in a different,
0:27:42 - 0:27:45::you know, framing, a different point of view,
0:27:45 - 0:27:48::they can understand it a little bit more.
0:27:48 - 0:27:52::And that's kind of what we do as, and that's kind of a
0:27:52 - 0:27:54::special skill that we have as comedians.
0:27:54 - 0:27:57::Well, we're more artists, I would say, than comedians,
0:27:57 - 0:27:59::but we're in more philosophers.
0:27:59 - 0:28:00::Isn't that interesting?
0:28:00 - 0:28:01::Isn't it?
0:28:01 - 0:28:02::It's interesting.
0:28:02 - 0:28:06::It's interesting, sorry, that in order to understand
0:28:06 - 0:28:10::something, it helps to have it be described incorrectly.
0:28:10 - 0:28:11::Whoa.
0:28:11 - 0:28:13::That's what a metaphor is.
0:28:13 - 0:28:16::So somebody might say, hey, you go plug in that plug for me
0:28:17 - 0:28:20::in the outlet hole, and you'd say, you know, I might take you
0:28:20 - 0:28:21::a second to comprehend.
0:28:21 - 0:28:25::But if somebody said, hey, man, would you go breathe life
0:28:25 - 0:28:29::electronically as the snake goes into the cave of,
0:28:29 - 0:28:33::and the snake goes into the cave of internet,
0:28:33 - 0:28:40::facilitation, current portal, you might go, wow, you know,
0:28:40 - 0:28:42::now I have, I don't just get it.
0:28:42 - 0:28:45::It's actually going from my short-term memory into my
0:28:46 - 0:28:47::long-term memory.
0:28:47 - 0:28:49::There's significance to what you say now.
0:28:49 - 0:28:52::I don't just hear the fact it's staying with me forever
0:28:52 - 0:28:54::because it has significance.
0:28:54 - 0:28:59::You know what we need to have is a kind of metaphor competition.
0:28:59 - 0:29:03::So any metaphors that you have, let us know in the
0:29:03 - 0:29:05::motherfucking comments.
0:29:05 - 0:29:06::All right.
0:29:06 - 0:29:10::Just we're taking any type of metaphor at all that you are coming
0:29:10 - 0:29:11::up with.
0:29:11 - 0:29:14::This is a met, and the best metaphor wins.
0:29:14 - 0:29:15::What do you win?
0:29:15 - 0:29:16::I don't know.
0:29:16 - 0:29:17::We'll determine that.
0:29:17 - 0:29:18::That's the metaphor.
0:29:18 - 0:29:19::That, yes.
0:29:19 - 0:29:25::But I think we need to transform the world with these,
0:29:25 - 0:29:29::transmute, and transform the world with language.
0:29:29 - 0:29:31::You know what I'm saying?
0:29:31 - 0:29:32::Oh, you know what?
0:29:32 - 0:29:34::Somebody was saying earlier about speaking in tongues.
0:29:34 - 0:29:36::Is that speaking in teeth?
0:29:36 - 0:29:37::Oh, oh.
0:29:38 - 0:29:39::Oh.
0:29:39 - 0:29:40::Oh.
0:29:40 - 0:29:41::Oh.
0:29:41 - 0:29:42::Oh.
0:29:42 - 0:29:43::Teeth.
0:29:43 - 0:29:44::Chatter, only podcast.
0:29:44 - 0:29:48::Speaking in teeth, it's a new heightened, even more
0:29:48 - 0:29:49::non-denominational talent.
0:29:49 - 0:29:50::And spirituality.
0:29:50 - 0:29:52::If you're not Christian, you have to feel comfortable speaking in tongues,
0:29:52 - 0:29:53::give the teeth a rattle.
0:29:53 - 0:29:54::Good God.
0:29:54 - 0:29:55::Genius.
0:29:55 - 0:29:56::Genius.
0:29:56 - 0:29:59::So what do you guys think about this, Alex Baldwin shit.
0:29:59 - 0:30:00::Yeah.

0:30:00 - 0:30:04::So what happened? He shot somebody a while back. This ain't good.
0:30:04 - 0:30:09::First off, thank you for asking this important question.
0:30:09 - 0:30:13::And I know a lot of people want to hear sort of our angle on this.
0:30:13 - 0:30:17::And a lot of people I think have withheld their own opinions
0:30:17 - 0:30:20::because they want to listen to, oh, what are the joy tactics
0:30:20 - 0:30:24::lads have to say about this? And then all kind of, you know,
0:30:24 - 0:30:27::reformulate what I think and copy what their thoughts are.
0:30:27 - 0:30:30::Which we don't, we don't really want people to do that.
0:30:30 - 0:30:34::But if you're kind of stupid as fuck and dumb and don't have opinions for yourself,
0:30:34 - 0:30:38::you can co-opt our opinions. And that's what we're here for.
0:30:38 - 0:30:44::But if you want sort of a crazy, like, you know, morally sound right opinion,
0:30:44 - 0:30:48::I say lock that mother fucker up.
0:30:48 - 0:30:53::Get him in jail. And treat him badly there.
0:30:53 - 0:30:59::And because I don't think I was bottling is the best person.
0:30:59 - 0:31:03::Well, Nate, that's a little bit, I don't mean to offend you,
0:31:03 - 0:31:06::but I feel like that's a little bit of an antiquated take.
0:31:06 - 0:31:09::And what I think we need to do instead of just putting people away,
0:31:09 - 0:31:13::disagreeing, but it's healthy. Healthy disagreement coming up.
0:31:13 - 0:31:15::No worries. We're about to get into it. Get ready.
0:31:15 - 0:31:17::Okay, go ahead, Jack. No, no, no.
0:31:17 - 0:31:19::For a second, I still don't know. It's a respect for you.
0:31:19 - 0:31:21::You're not right. You're not right. You're not right.
0:31:21 - 0:31:23::I'm going to tell you right now what I think. No, I would love.
0:31:23 - 0:31:25::No, I would actually love to hear what you think, Jack.
0:31:25 - 0:31:27::What do you want to talk to me? I could tell.
0:31:27 - 0:31:29::I could tell from your tone. Okay, go ahead.
0:31:29 - 0:31:31::I could tell. All right, here I go. Here I go. And mute yourself.
0:31:31 - 0:31:33::All right, here I go.
0:31:33 - 0:31:34::Okay.
0:31:34 - 0:31:41::Instead of having the approach of punishment lock them up forever,
0:31:41 - 0:31:44::it's something called rehabilitation.
0:31:44 - 0:31:47::What I, and I'm talking about radical rehabilitation.
0:31:47 - 0:31:51::So this Alec Baldwin, I agree with you actually on this.
0:31:51 - 0:31:53::He's fucked up beyond the pale.
0:31:53 - 0:31:57::And everybody in his, well, I won't get into his family.
0:31:57 - 0:32:01::But we need to put him back at square one.
0:32:01 - 0:32:05::Let's have him adopted right now by people who are in front.
0:32:05 - 0:32:09::And they will be able to say, Alec Baldwin, you're about to take a pill cocktail.
0:32:09 - 0:32:12::It's going to wipe all of your memories and behaviors.
0:32:12 - 0:32:16::And we are going to start from square one physically and mentally.
0:32:16 - 0:32:18::You're not going to be able to walk. You're not going to be able to talk.
0:32:18 - 0:32:20::And you're not going to remember any of this.
0:32:20 - 0:32:27::But in 20 years, we're going to, we are going to reintroduce you to yourself through movies that you've been in.
0:32:27 - 0:32:28::Oh my God.
0:32:28 - 0:32:31::Finally, the day is in a come where he's going to be back on set.
0:32:31 - 0:32:33::And he's going to be back in that scenario.
0:32:33 - 0:32:36::And he's, we're going to see.
0:32:36 - 0:32:38::Can you do the right thing?
0:32:38 - 0:32:42::That is so futuristic legini.
0:32:42 - 0:32:46::So I'm like, really, my eyes are kind of sparkling out.
0:32:46 - 0:32:47::Interesting.
0:32:47 - 0:32:48::I'm serious.
0:32:48 - 0:32:57::I'm kind of blown away by this sort of creative take on basically the justice system right now.
0:32:57 - 0:33:00::Wipe there to clean, put them in the foster care system,
0:33:00 - 0:33:06::and then kind of reintegrate them into their past life and see how they,
0:33:06 - 0:33:11::their opinion with kind of clean, a clean slate, a clean vision.
0:33:11 - 0:33:13::Wow.
0:33:13 - 0:33:18::Shave them down to the bone and then regrow the meat metaphorically.
0:33:18 - 0:33:19::So Eric.
0:33:19 - 0:33:20::That's amazing.
0:33:20 - 0:33:22::So what do I think should happen to out of Baldwin?
0:33:22 - 0:33:24::Yeah, what, what do you think?
0:33:24 - 0:33:31::I am also conflicted on this because what he did was not chill.
0:33:31 - 0:33:37::And I think that consequences need to be dispensed.
0:33:37 - 0:33:40::Well, where does, where do you think the buck of responsibility is passed?
0:33:40 - 0:33:42::Is it the person holding it?
0:33:42 - 0:33:45::Is it the person who came up with the idea for the movie?
0:33:45 - 0:33:47::Is it like what?
0:33:47 - 0:33:48::Where do you know?
0:33:48 - 0:33:51::As somebody, because you're going to be, you're going to be in his shoes one day.
0:33:51 - 0:33:52::Is it actions?
0:33:52 - 0:33:53::You are, huh?
0:33:53 - 0:33:55::You're going to be in his shoes with like killing somebody.
0:33:55 - 0:33:56::You're really like Eric.
0:33:56 - 0:33:57::I know it.
0:33:57 - 0:33:59::A stunt's going to go wrong.
0:33:59 - 0:34:01::And it's not going to be with a weapon.
0:34:01 - 0:34:02::It's going to be with your strength.
0:34:02 - 0:34:03::My fists.
0:34:03 - 0:34:04::I know.
0:34:04 - 0:34:08::Well, actually one time I did a short film for real.
0:34:08 - 0:34:10::And do you guys know this?
0:34:10 - 0:34:13::There's a part where I'm like, why you did a short film?
0:34:13 - 0:34:14::Yeah.
0:34:14 - 0:34:16::I've done more than you.
0:34:16 - 0:34:17::I've done more than you.
0:34:17 - 0:34:18::I've done more than you.
0:34:18 - 0:34:19::I've done more than you.
0:34:19 - 0:34:20::I've done more than you.
0:34:20 - 0:34:21::That's awesome.
0:34:21 - 0:34:22::I've been here.
0:34:22 - 0:34:23::Hang, man.
0:34:23 - 0:34:24::I could really see you.
0:34:24 - 0:34:26::There's a part where I'm checking someone's blood pressure.
0:34:26 - 0:34:27::And we all know this guy.
0:34:27 - 0:34:32::And I'm pumping up the blood pressure on this actor.
0:34:32 - 0:34:34::And we're in the scene.
0:34:34 - 0:34:37::I'm not recognizing that this thing is actually working
0:34:37 - 0:34:39::and like constricting on his arm.
0:34:39 - 0:34:41::And it constricts so tightly.
0:34:41 - 0:34:43::And then he says, like, can we stop?
0:34:43 - 0:34:45::And it really hurt him really badly.
0:34:45 - 0:34:47::And I went, oh, stop, stop.
0:34:47 - 0:34:48::And you just are literally.
0:34:48 - 0:34:51::I didn't even think about it being connected.
0:34:51 - 0:34:53::And I felt so bad.
0:34:53 - 0:34:55::And I've been trying to think about punishment for myself
0:34:55 - 0:34:57::for that for years.
0:34:57 - 0:34:59::And I just need to be.

0:35:00 - 0:35:02.560000::You need to be squeezed as hard as you squeezed them
0:35:03.080000 - 0:35:05.280000::Someone's exactly we could do that on the pod
0:35:05.280000 - 0:35:11.600000::We should do the redemption pod where we pick the 10 worst things we've done and we kind of get physical redemption on ourselves
0:35:11.600000 - 0:35:12.600000::Oh
0:35:12.600000 - 0:35:14.120000::Interesting
0:35:14.120000 - 0:35:19.460000::I also think you know, I don't know about my that that's perfect for my punishment for that crime
0:35:19.720000 - 0:35:26.360000::But for out Baldwin if he did some type of mukbang with the nastiest foods on the planet and it's a
0:35:26.360000 - 0:35:29.920000::24 48 hour marathon mukbang of like
0:35:30.680000 - 0:35:37.920000::Sharp ass foods dog foods stink. Yes nasty ass foods, and he's like wants to stop eating so bad
0:35:37.920000 - 0:35:41.560000::But he can't and he goes through the basically the gauntlet
0:35:42.440000 - 0:35:48.100000::Having to eat live octopus and all this shit and he loves octopus it's proctopie. So air
0:35:49 - 0:35:52.400000::It's really you know, I know it's it's
0:35:53.360000 - 0:35:59.840000::We are so create able to speak so creatively about it because we don't know these people right mm-hmm right so let me ask you this
0:36:00.320000 - 0:36:03.160000::If it was the person you love most in your life Eric
0:36:04.200000 - 0:36:06.200000::Which is
0:36:06.200000 - 0:36:10.900000::I don't know Charlize Theron. Yeah, it's probably somebody you don't know personally and that's like
0:36:10.900000 - 0:36:16.240000::I'm so happy that you were so what it make you know and they were murdered savagely by a
0:36:16.880000 - 0:36:18.160000::negligent
0:36:18.160000 - 0:36:20.160000::sexy as fuck dude
0:36:20.480000 - 0:36:26.580000::Me probably alright. Yeah, so if Nate murdered your most love person on the planet
0:36:27.240000 - 0:36:30::Mm-hmm is that is that what would you really feel like that was enough?
0:36:30.720000 - 0:36:35.920000::Here's what I do man if you can to me of Nate and you apologized wholeheartedly. Yeah, hey man
0:36:35.920000 - 0:36:37.920000::I was not feeling that good. I'm sorry
0:36:38.920000 - 0:36:40.920000::I told you I'm so understanding
0:36:40.920000 - 0:36:45.360000::But then very likely something in me even after the apology some
0:36:46.280000 - 0:36:48.280000::upsetness would spring back
0:36:48.840000 - 0:36:57.480000::Into action and I'd take a put a glock in your mouth. I would like to point out once again
0:36:58.280000 - 0:37:03.960000::This is what I'm saying where we only have about 10 or 15 topics that we could do
0:37:05.640000 - 0:37:10.680000::We're lupin oh we didn't use that episode. I don't think we use that one. Yeah, this is my bad art my bad
0:37:15.360000 - 0:37:20.480000::Make a brain. Is that a right what you just made that up? You're crazy, dude. We might have to believe
0:37:22.080000 - 0:37:23.920000::Something tells me Eric when
0:37:24.720000 - 0:37:26.240000::when you
0:37:26.240000 - 0:37:28.880000::sort of go to that place of
0:37:29.640000 - 0:37:32.040000::Darkness and if you had to
0:37:32.800000 - 0:37:40.240000::Become physically violent to protect somebody. I don't think that you would remember what you did
0:37:40.240000 - 0:37:43.560000::I think you would black out you're one of those people that would just
0:37:43.960000 - 0:37:45.960000::fully black out and
0:37:45.960000 - 0:37:53.680000::Kind of go like hawk style and it's like somebody has to like smack you like get them off of you know like get them off of him
0:37:53.680000 - 0:37:56.760000::You know and you're just like you kind of wake up and you're like what have I done?
0:37:56.760000 - 0:38:01.520000::And there's like blood everywhere and you're kind of like shocked out of it. You know what I'm saying
0:38:03.160000 - 0:38:06.640000::Which that's a crazy conundrum which has it's you can see that happening
0:38:06.640000 - 0:38:09.360000::I could see that I could see that happening to you. Yes
0:38:09.480000 - 0:38:16.040000::Well because I'm such a nice guy and people think I'm so calm and they could do whatever to me
0:38:16.320000 - 0:38:19.200000::But if you press the right buttons in the right combination
0:38:20.560000 - 0:38:28.120000::Game shark style you'll unlock a cheat code for me that is not too pleasant and it's a game-ender and it'll corrupt your save file
0:38:29.320000 - 0:38:33.920000::What I just got so sad imagining you as kind of an emotional Hulk?
0:38:34.280000 - 0:38:39.440000::Where you're like this imagine this like basically you turn into this other version of Eric
0:38:39.640000 - 0:38:41.640000::Maybe you're green. It's not important
0:38:41.720000 - 0:38:47.800000::Where you are so fucking fun and helpful and useful to be around
0:38:48.840000 - 0:38:55.760000::But you don't remember any of it and then you wake up from being that Hulk the emotional Hulk and it's like dang man like
0:38:56.280000 - 0:39:02.040000::Who do I who do I love is it Eric or is it the other one?
0:39:02.040000 - 0:39:06.960000::So you're saying like there's a Hulk like a different type of Hulk style where it's like you turn into this person
0:39:06.960000 - 0:39:10.680000::That's like volunteering and you know like promoting like
0:39:11.720000 - 0:39:16.280000::Philanthropic like right endeavor is the beast
0:39:18.960000 - 0:39:21.840000::Mr. Beast deserves some type of I
0:39:22.400000 - 0:39:29.200000::Think mobile metal he needs I can he is very soon in the future when Trump is president in 2024
0:39:29.200000 - 0:39:32.720000::I'm not saying I'm for that. I just think you know, maybe that's possible
0:39:32.720000 - 0:39:39.160000::I think Trump will be I could see him putting on some sort of metal on Mr. Beast that's meant for
0:39:39.680000 - 0:39:46.880000::Marines that have been in combat because he starts like World War III as a YouTube video of some sort and it's just kind of like
0:39:47.080000 - 0:39:54.760000::You know kind of pranks the whole world in that regard and that's it. I can't reveal what my what my master plan is
0:39:54.760000 - 0:40:00.040000::You know it's gonna be crazy because come on man because it's gonna be so surprised

0:40:00 - 0:40:03::that people are going to be like, yo, this is...
0:40:03 - 0:40:06::Eric, don't you think he should just tell us?
0:40:06 - 0:40:07::I do think that.
0:40:07 - 0:40:09::All right, I'm gonna fake my death
0:40:09 - 0:40:11::and then I'm gonna show up in Times Square
0:40:11 - 0:40:12::or just kind of...
0:40:12 - 0:40:13::Probably just...
0:40:13 - 0:40:15::I'm gonna fake my death.
0:40:15 - 0:40:16::I'm gonna fake my death.
0:40:16 - 0:40:18::They do boaster beasts.
0:40:18 - 0:40:19::They do boaster beasts.
0:40:19 - 0:40:21::We need him on the pod immediately.
0:40:21 - 0:40:22::We need to talk to that man.
0:40:22 - 0:40:23::And get into his fucking head.
0:40:23 - 0:40:26::I wanna get into his brain for one minute.
0:40:26 - 0:40:27::I'm afraid.
0:40:27 - 0:40:28::I feel like that's...
0:40:28 - 0:40:30::I'm gonna move you whiplast with J.K. Simons.
0:40:30 - 0:40:31::Yeah.
0:40:31 - 0:40:33::I feel like I'd be afraid that Mr. Beast on
0:40:33 - 0:40:36::because we're just so not gonna be at his tempo
0:40:36 - 0:40:38::that he's gonna be like, what the fuck is this?
0:40:38 - 0:40:39::You guys have no retention skills.
0:40:39 - 0:40:40::You're not ready.
0:40:40 - 0:40:41::Where is the...
0:40:41 - 0:40:42::What the fuck?
0:40:42 - 0:40:43::Where's the click?
0:40:43 - 0:40:46::Yeah, you think that Mr. Beast is entirent?
0:40:46 - 0:40:47::I think so.
0:40:47 - 0:40:48::I think he definitely is.
0:40:48 - 0:40:50::Jack, would you...
0:40:50 - 0:40:54::If you had the opportunity to be mentored by Mr. Beast
0:40:54 - 0:40:55::and he was like,
0:40:55 - 0:41:00::I'm gonna help you become basically Mr. Beast
0:41:00 - 0:41:02::2.0.
0:41:02 - 0:41:05::And he was, you know, Simons style whiplash.
0:41:05 - 0:41:07::You're like creating YouTube videos
0:41:07 - 0:41:09::and he's like, the thumbnail isn't fucking right.
0:41:09 - 0:41:11::You know what I'm saying?
0:41:11 - 0:41:12::Like screaming at you.
0:41:12 - 0:41:13::Would you endure that?
0:41:13 - 0:41:15::And do you think like that would help you
0:41:15 - 0:41:19::as a content creator put out some amazing shit in the end?
0:41:19 - 0:41:22::Or do you think that you would suffer a lot of trauma
0:41:22 - 0:41:25::and come out of it a shell of yourself
0:41:25 - 0:41:29::and kind of resenting Mr. Beast
0:41:29 - 0:41:31::for putting you through that shit?
0:41:31 - 0:41:34::Um, that's tough,
0:41:34 - 0:41:36::because there's a side of me that's like,
0:41:36 - 0:41:38::I am very sensitive.
0:41:38 - 0:41:40::If anybody raises their voice at me,
0:41:40 - 0:41:41::I'll start crying right away
0:41:41 - 0:41:42::and I won't be able to focus.
0:41:42 - 0:41:44::And then I'll just be thinking about that moment
0:41:44 - 0:41:46::for the rest of my life.
0:41:46 - 0:41:47::Wow.
0:41:47 - 0:41:48::But there's another side of me that's like,
0:41:48 - 0:41:49::you know what?
0:41:50 - 0:41:53::Maybe I need to be shook,
0:41:53 - 0:41:56::really hard by somebody my size,
0:41:56 - 0:41:59::who's gonna just push me to the brink.
0:41:59 - 0:42:01::And then while he's teaching me all that stuff,
0:42:01 - 0:42:03::I can start looking over his shoulder trying to memorize
0:42:03 - 0:42:05::his password, stall his emails and stuff
0:42:05 - 0:42:08::and slowly start siphoning money out of his organization.
0:42:08 - 0:42:10::And then I can kind of piece out,
0:42:10 - 0:42:12::get out of the country, fake my own death,
0:42:12 - 0:42:14::and then not have to worry about any of this shit.
0:42:14 - 0:42:16::Oh, that's interesting.
0:42:16 - 0:42:17::Wow.
0:42:17 - 0:42:19::I'm not gonna turn there, but I'm always thinking
0:42:19 - 0:42:20::about the exit route.
0:42:20 - 0:42:21::You know when you go into a restaurant,
0:42:21 - 0:42:23::you're thinking, where's the nearest exit?
0:42:23 - 0:42:25::I think about that with my career,
0:42:25 - 0:42:29::with the country, with every relationship I have.
0:42:29 - 0:42:32::What's the fastest way I could cut ties and ghost
0:42:32 - 0:42:36::to the point where nobody will ever see me again?
0:42:36 - 0:42:38::Because life is one giant restaurant.
0:42:38 - 0:42:39::Do you think that's...
0:42:39 - 0:42:41::And what's on the menu?
0:42:41 - 0:42:46::Do you think that is possible to actually fake your own death
0:42:46 - 0:42:51::and live your life a second life in some sort of
0:42:51 - 0:42:53::other country you go to South America
0:42:53 - 0:42:55::and be in kind of a remote village
0:42:55 - 0:43:00::and have kind of like a second version of yourself
0:43:00 - 0:43:02::where you're with the people there
0:43:02 - 0:43:05::and they don't know who you are
0:43:05 - 0:43:10::and you have a new partner and children there
0:43:10 - 0:43:13::and you're one with the community.
0:43:13 - 0:43:14::And know of course.
0:43:14 - 0:43:18::Do you think that has happened like a famous person?
0:43:18 - 0:43:20::Well, I do know, I'll speak on this really quickly.
0:43:20 - 0:43:22::There was just a case in Germany
0:43:22 - 0:43:25::where a woman found another woman
0:43:25 - 0:43:27::that looked like her, a doppelganger.
0:43:27 - 0:43:32::And she stabbed this woman many times to her death
0:43:32 - 0:43:36::and tried to convince everybody that that was her.
0:43:36 - 0:43:39::So she used this other person's body thinking,
0:43:39 - 0:43:41::make people think that that was her death
0:43:41 - 0:43:43::and then she could leave her life.
0:43:43 - 0:43:44::Oh my God.
0:43:44 - 0:43:47::So you have to have the same voice and you'd have to...
0:43:47 - 0:43:48::Well, but this person's dead.
0:43:48 - 0:43:50::So the, I mean, you see it then.
0:43:50 - 0:43:52::Yeah, but then you go to hang out with their friends
0:43:52 - 0:43:53::and they're like, oh, yeah.
0:43:53 - 0:43:54::No, she didn't want to take her life.
0:43:54 - 0:43:56::She just wanted to escape.
0:43:56 - 0:43:57::Wait, what?
0:43:59 - 0:44:00::What happened?
0:44:00 - 0:44:03::Somebody killed somebody that looked like them?
0:44:03 - 0:44:07::Uh-huh. And then tried to convince everybody that that person was her body.
0:44:07 - 0:44:09::Like try to make it look like that was her body.
0:44:09 - 0:44:10::Oh.
0:44:10 - 0:44:12::So that's your standard.
0:44:12 - 0:44:13::I thought, okay.
0:44:13 - 0:44:15::She wasn't trying to take over that person's life.
0:44:15 - 0:44:16::She was trying to reverse.
0:44:16 - 0:44:17::Exactly.
0:44:17 - 0:44:18::Interesting.
0:44:18 - 0:44:19::Wow.
0:44:19 - 0:44:21::But then they would just do the DNA test, obviously.
0:44:21 - 0:44:23::And then I guess they probably did the DNA test.
0:44:23 - 0:44:25::And it was a pretty easy fix.
0:44:25 - 0:44:28::Yeah, they, and then something that my missing kind of looked like her.
0:44:28 - 0:44:29::I don't know.
0:44:29 - 0:44:32::I would love to fake my own death.
0:44:32 - 0:44:34::But then come back.
0:44:34 - 0:44:35::Yeah, right.
0:44:35 - 0:44:36::Fade my death for two years.
0:44:36 - 0:44:37::Watch all the...
0:44:37 - 0:44:38::I legit...
0:44:38 - 0:44:39::I don't want...
0:44:39 - 0:44:41::They are going to play this back when I die.
0:44:41 - 0:44:44::They're going to play this moment back on the pod.
0:44:44 - 0:44:46::You know, 40 years from now.
0:44:46 - 0:44:49::But I have a kind of a secret plan.
0:44:49 - 0:44:51::And that's all I'm going to say.
0:44:51 - 0:44:52::And that's all I'm going to say.
0:44:52 - 0:44:55::And I'm just going to leave this little sound white right here.
0:44:55 - 0:44:58::For when I mysteriously pass away.
0:44:58 - 0:44:59::When I am...

0:45:00 - 0:45:05.820000::You know 82 years old or whatever and everybody thinks that it is from a
0:45:06.460000 - 0:45:10.820000::Terminal disease or something like that just know just know
0:45:11.940000 - 0:45:16.360000::There's something else going on that's all I'm gonna say no no no no no no
0:45:16.480000 - 0:45:21.300000::That's all I can say right now because I have a kind of a master plan because I don't want to reveal
0:45:21.540000 - 0:45:25.560000::You know what the plan is because that's that it'll be a surprise you know what I'm saying
0:45:26.340000 - 0:45:28.340000::Yeah, and that's it
0:45:28.340000 - 0:45:35.180000::I can't reveal what my what my master plan is dude. You know, it's gonna be crazy because come on man
0:45:35.180000 - 0:45:39.160000::Because it's gonna be so surprising that people are going to be like yo
0:45:40.500000 - 0:45:44.600000::Eric, don't you think he should just tell us I do think that all right
0:45:44.600000 - 0:45:48.100000::I'm gonna fake my death and then I'm gonna show up in Times Square or just kind of
0:45:48.100000 - 0:45:50.100000::I
0:45:53.220000 - 0:45:56.680000::That's it. So if I die so if I die just kind of like
0:45:57.380000 - 0:46:03.440000::Just just just kind of look around in Times Square like a couple years after and there's gonna be a older version of me
0:46:03.440000 - 0:46:05.440000::That's kind of looks
0:46:05.440000 - 0:46:10.520000::You know like he's been through a lot of shit in a different country and it's you know
0:46:10.520000 - 0:46:16.700000::It's taken a lot for him to get back to New York City via small boats and you know cargo ships
0:46:16.700000 - 0:46:23.240000::And I'm gonna smell and it might not be recognizable but just just keep your eyes open. That's all say I
0:46:23.660000 - 0:46:25.940000::Feel like there's a couple people like that right now
0:46:26.420000 - 0:46:32.360000::Yeah, right you might mistake it as like somebody else, but you'll know you'll know if it's me like
0:46:32.660000 - 0:46:35.720000::Because I'm really nice and in person and
0:46:37.740000 - 0:46:43.880000::You're nice, but you're also sexy man dude, and you know, we're all different times of sexy in a way
0:46:43.880000 - 0:46:52::We kind of all are and that's weird that there's different complexities and multitudes to being sexy and a lot of people can be sexy
0:46:52 - 0:46:57.160000::But in their own kind of unique separate ways and all of us have our own unique sort of
0:46:57.400000 - 0:47:03::Riz and sexiness to us wait. Should we go around and describe each other sexiness?
0:47:03.840000 - 0:47:05.840000::Yeah, yes
0:47:05.840000 - 0:47:07.840000::Absolutely, that's such a good idea
0:47:11.120000 - 0:47:13.120000::Who she's are with?
0:47:14.160000 - 0:47:16.160000::Let's start with yeah
0:47:16.160000 - 0:47:22.120000::How is Jack like what's his own kind of like sexiness? What is he bringing to the sexiness spectrum?
0:47:22.120000 - 0:47:30.040000::Yeah, I don't even know if you know this man, but you bring a sense of mysteriousity to your environments
0:47:30.800000 - 0:47:39.360000::You walk in the room. Oh snap. He's tall. Oh snap. He's got an amazing BMI as as far as I know
0:47:39.360000 - 0:47:43.520000::Oh snap. He dresses like a skater and oh snap
0:47:43.520000 - 0:47:51.920000::I'm feeling magnetized to him and oh snap. He's got that facial structure that I like and
0:47:53.040000 - 0:47:55.680000::I just know when you walk in the room
0:47:56.680000 - 0:47:58.680000::people are gone like this
0:48:00.040000 - 0:48:06.520000::When we're at SNL and there are many celebrities abounding all around us. Here's what happened when we walked into that one room
0:48:07.160000 - 0:48:12.840000::People in Eric's turning turning a property. I was turning around looking at your ass and your face
0:48:13.720000 - 0:48:17.160000::There there is a type of mystery to your
0:48:18.040000 - 0:48:22.680000::To your sexiness and Eric I will say that your sexiness is
0:48:23.760000 - 0:48:28.200000::Kind of like it's kind of shocking in a way when you step into a room
0:48:28.200000 - 0:48:35.600000::It is like it's kind of energetic and palpable like people can say people can feel it like if you step into a room
0:48:35.640000 - 0:48:39.080000::They might not see you but they like that something perked up
0:48:39.320000 - 0:48:43.840000::You know, I'm saying they see you there's no such thing as seeing Eric from a distance
0:48:43.840000 - 0:48:47.760000::If you see Eric the second you see him you feel like you are fucking nose to nose
0:48:48 - 0:48:52.080000::Four head to forehead with him you feel like you are shoved in a sleeping bag body to body
0:48:52.480000 - 0:48:55.920000::Sweat in on each other that's what it feels like to just look at you in the eyes man
0:48:55.920000 - 0:49:00.080000::No matter how far away go a little deeper on this because I'm like trying to run my head around this
0:49:00.480000 - 0:49:01.480000::No, right
0:49:01.560000 - 0:49:06.520000::So well funny because it's hard to see just like an elephant doesn't see themselves as a giant in the mirror, right
0:49:07.320000 - 0:49:10.760000::But you are so sexy and what way though like charisma
0:49:11.400000 - 0:49:13.400000::In a way that feel
0:49:13.640000 - 0:49:19.560000::Tell you're dressing first of all wow lately man you've been on this incredible like
0:49:20.200000 - 0:49:22.200000::Wow, this guy maybe used to be like a
0:49:22.920000 - 0:49:29.160000::Olympic wrestler for a different country and he lived in like Albania or Montenegro for a while
0:49:29.640000 - 0:49:33.240000::But now he's back and he's doing his thing with the amateur golf and he's
0:49:34.360000 - 0:49:40.680000::You know pressing everybody out listens to all the all types of amazing music that I wouldn't really even necessarily think that he did
0:49:40.680000 - 0:49:42.680000::But he knows so much about all these
0:49:43.400000 - 0:49:46.040000::And bands like European Polish techno
0:49:48.120000 - 0:49:54.040000::Like shit that like New Yorkers are like if there was if there was a New York if there was like a level of New York
0:49:54.520000 - 0:49:58.440000::Underneath New York. I guess I'm talking about the underground scene. Yeah
0:49:58.440000 - 0:50:00.840000::Well, I don't want to talk too much

0:50:00 - 0:50:02.860000::about my involvement there because I'll start to.
0:50:02.860000 - 0:50:06.100000::You're feeling kind of a legend in the underground scene.
0:50:06.100000 - 0:50:09.840000::Maybe nobody knows about you outside of that,
0:50:09.840000 - 0:50:14.040000::but underground is like you are the Brad Pitt of underground.
0:50:14.040000 - 0:50:16.760000::And it is like you walk into a certain type of club
0:50:16.760000 - 0:50:18.760000::where it's like there's low lighting.
0:50:18.760000 - 0:50:23.240000::The the the wait staff there is fucking everybody's so attractive
0:50:23.240000 - 0:50:26.800000::wearing the craziest clothes, but it's like kind of vintage.

0:50:42.480000 - 0:50:44.680000::Let me say one more thing about Eric.
0:50:44.680000 - 0:50:48.480000::Eric, you might not be the sexiest version of anything.
0:50:48.480000 - 0:50:49.560000::But guess what?
