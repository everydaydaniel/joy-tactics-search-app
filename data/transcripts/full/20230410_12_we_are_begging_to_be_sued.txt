0:00:00 - 0:00:06::Keele's deodorant and a mixture of margella.
0:00:06 - 0:00:08::It's right there, bitch.
0:00:08 - 0:00:10::I don't know why I said that.
0:00:10 - 0:00:12::I'm not that sweet.
0:00:12 - 0:00:21::Welcome to Joy Tactics, the podcast dedicated to all things joyful, joyous and meeting as many celebrities as humanly possible.

0:00:25 - 0:00:27::Enjoy.
0:00:28 - 0:00:32::There's no bleeping for anything you say on this episode, right Eric?
0:00:32 - 0:00:34::Just I don't care what the fuck you say.
0:00:34 - 0:00:38::You are going down and in flames with whatever that you got to be careful.
0:00:38 - 0:00:40::I'm not I'm so soon.
0:00:40 - 0:00:46::I would give anything to just fucking rip a hookah with Jonah Hill and freestyle all.
0:00:46 - 0:00:55::And just sit in like an apartment complex about an hour outside of Baltimore at my parent like my friends parents place.
0:00:55 - 0:00:59::I just pick some 90s style freestyle with the whiteies.
0:00:59 - 0:01:03::You start having so much on with Jonah Hill that you make a Macaulay.
0:01:03 - 0:01:05::Is he sober?
0:01:05 - 0:01:06::I don't know if he is.
0:01:06 - 0:01:08::No, he deals with any addictions.
0:01:08 - 0:01:10::God help me for saying that.
0:01:10 - 0:01:16::But that's just the amount of fun that we have where people wouldn't want to stop drinking with us the first time that you'll with us.
0:01:16 - 0:01:17::You know what I'm saying?
0:01:17 - 0:01:19::Yeah, but they want to keep that high going.
0:01:19 - 0:01:20::I understand that.
0:01:20 - 0:01:24::Do you remember when that video of Leonardo DiCaprio?
0:01:24 - 0:01:26::He bum rushes.
0:01:26 - 0:01:28::Oh, he's on the hill on the street.
0:01:28 - 0:01:33::Yeah, and he said, oh, God, what the fuck is fans about to oh shit?
0:01:33 - 0:01:34::My man.
0:01:34 - 0:01:35::Yeah.
0:01:35 - 0:01:37::Let me ask you.
0:01:37 - 0:01:38::I'm sorry.
0:01:38 - 0:01:39::I just see Leonardo DiCaprio right now.
0:01:39 - 0:01:40::I say this.
0:01:40 - 0:01:42::Could you really not fit on the door?
0:01:42 - 0:01:43::Mm-hmm.
0:01:43 - 0:01:44::Fit on the door.
0:01:44 - 0:01:45::Wait, what?
0:01:45 - 0:01:46::It's Titanic.
0:01:46 - 0:01:48::Could you really not fit on the door?
0:01:48 - 0:01:52::Or is it because what people don't realize about that debate is it's not just shape wise.
0:01:52 - 0:01:53::It's buoyancy.
0:01:53 - 0:01:54::Right.
0:01:54 - 0:01:56::It's a little bit of a buoyancy factor.
0:01:56 - 0:01:57::Right.
0:01:57 - 0:02:02::And especially what the water's cold, it's moving more rapidly for people to fall through.
0:02:02 - 0:02:05::Man, what you guys weren't right now.
0:02:05 - 0:02:19::Hey, what I got on right now is some khakis, a probably 20 year old shirt that is, I think it's at the cusp of fraying and getting old and no, man.
0:02:19 - 0:02:20::Are you kidding me?
0:02:20 - 0:02:21::You're medium?
0:02:21 - 0:02:22::No, I'm alive.
0:02:22 - 0:02:23::This is a lodge.
0:02:23 - 0:02:26::Larges come in medium sizes.
0:02:26 - 0:02:27::I feel like I know.
0:02:27 - 0:02:28::I know.
0:02:28 - 0:02:29::I know.
0:02:29 - 0:02:30::It's not true.
0:02:30 - 0:02:31::It's not because I'm weighed on.
0:02:31 - 0:02:32::I know that the large has changed.
0:02:32 - 0:02:33::The largest have changed.
0:02:33 - 0:02:34::Yeah.
0:02:34 - 0:02:38::And it's in, we're not, they think we're dumb.
0:02:38 - 0:02:39::These clothing companies.
0:02:39 - 0:02:40::They're sneaking in.
0:02:40 - 0:02:41::Oh, reverse.
0:02:41 - 0:02:45::Yeah, they're taking away fabrics from us.
0:02:45 - 0:02:46::Mm-hmm.
0:02:46 - 0:02:47::We notice.
0:02:47 - 0:02:48::We notice.
0:02:48 - 0:02:51::And what else am I worried?
0:02:51 - 0:02:54::Garvey, Garvey, the conservatory of Chicago.
0:02:54 - 0:02:57::I just got the gift shop because I wondered.
0:02:57 - 0:02:59::And you know what, it's free to go there.
0:02:59 - 0:03:01::But I said, I'm going to go to the gift shop and I'm going to support this.
0:03:01 - 0:03:02::How much was that?
0:03:02 - 0:03:03::$25?
0:03:03 - 0:03:04::$15.
0:03:04 - 0:03:06::Oh, that's a steal for a new one.
0:03:06 - 0:03:10::And I tip to, and I tip at places you don't, you're not supposed to.
0:03:10 - 0:03:11::What are you doing?
0:03:11 - 0:03:12::Yeah.
0:03:12 - 0:03:13::Yeah.
0:03:13 - 0:03:14::I'm like, here, just take it.
0:03:14 - 0:03:15::Take it.
0:03:15 - 0:03:16::And I said, don't put it in the system.
0:03:16 - 0:03:17::Take that back to your family.
0:03:17 - 0:03:18::Go buy it.
0:03:18 - 0:03:19::Yeah.
0:03:19 - 0:03:20::I'll be.
0:03:20 - 0:03:21::I'm doing ASMR.
0:03:21 - 0:03:22::I would love.
0:03:22 - 0:03:23::I would do Jax.
0:03:23 - 0:03:24::Fashion ASMR style.
0:03:24 - 0:03:25::Yeah.
0:03:25 - 0:03:27::Alright, here I go, y'all.
0:03:27 - 0:03:30::I'm wearing jeans.
0:03:30 - 0:03:39::I'm also wearing a sweater from the 80s that I got eBayed.
0:03:39 - 0:03:43::And I'm wearing a glasses.
0:03:43 - 0:03:47::And I'm wearing the same underwear I've been wearing yesterday.
0:03:47 - 0:03:54::And I feel like I had something else to say back in my clothes.
0:03:54 - 0:03:57::I got dress socks on.
0:03:57 - 0:04:01::I got dress socks on that I've got for my cousin's wedding.
0:04:01 - 0:04:03::You don't like a guy with a smoky voice?
0:04:03 - 0:04:04::I got dress.
0:04:04 - 0:04:05::I got one.
0:04:05 - 0:04:06::That's my voice.
0:04:06 - 0:04:07::That's my voice.
0:04:07 - 0:04:11::That's the dress socks that get so much nastier than regular cotton socks.
0:04:11 - 0:04:12::I know.
0:04:12 - 0:04:14::You wear dress socks for four hours.
0:04:14 - 0:04:16::Oh, you think of the wetness?
0:04:16 - 0:04:17::Yeah, good.
0:04:17 - 0:04:18::Good.
0:04:18 - 0:04:19::Good.
0:04:19 - 0:04:20::Dress socks need to change.
0:04:20 - 0:04:25::When you get like an every man's dress sock that thinks about how man actually sweats.
0:04:25 - 0:04:30::I just remember I was going to say, I feel like people who haven't seen me in person would be shocked
0:04:30 - 0:04:32::to hear what my shirt sizes are.
0:04:32 - 0:04:34::Because where are you wearing?
0:04:34 - 0:04:36::You're wearing a large, right?
0:04:36 - 0:04:38::Are you in a triple XL?
0:04:38 - 0:04:39::Tall tee?
0:04:39 - 0:04:43::I wear XL shirts and I wear double XL dress shirts.
0:04:43 - 0:04:44::Double?
0:04:44 - 0:04:45::You're not wearing a double XL dress.
0:04:45 - 0:04:46::I'm not.
0:04:46 - 0:04:47::It's because you got long arms.
0:04:47 - 0:04:48::It's because of the length.
0:04:48 - 0:04:49::It's not because of the length.
0:04:49 - 0:04:50::It's because my, you know, my legs are so long.
0:04:50 - 0:04:57::You need to hit the B and T store and get the T store.
0:04:57 - 0:04:58::You're not.
0:04:58 - 0:04:59::No, I need to hit the BLT store.

0:05:00 - 0:05:02.440000::What is B and T big and tall?
0:05:02.440000 - 0:05:05.080000::Oh, I've been to the big and tall store, but they denied me.
0:05:05.080000 - 0:05:06.280000::But you don't need the big part.
0:05:06.280000 - 0:05:08.280000::You have to be big and tall.
0:05:08.280000 - 0:05:09.600000::It's not big or tall for real.
0:05:09.600000 - 0:05:10.600000::They kicked me out.
0:05:10.600000 - 0:05:12.400000::I was looking for some clothes for big people.
0:05:12.400000 - 0:05:13.240000::And they said,
0:05:13.240000 - 0:05:14.240000::If you're just tall, be tall.
0:05:14.240000 - 0:05:19.240000::Well, if you're tall, not big, then you need to go to a tailor, I guess.
0:05:19.240000 - 0:05:20.840000::The world's not fair.
0:05:20.840000 - 0:05:21.840000::The opposite of that.
0:05:21.840000 - 0:05:25.480000::A short and tiny or a little and a small little as shit and fucking little.
0:05:25.480000 - 0:05:26.480000::Different way.
0:05:26.480000 - 0:05:27.480000::Little as shit and store.
0:05:27.480000 - 0:05:28.480000::You know they do.
0:05:28.480000 - 0:05:29.480000::They got them.
0:05:29.480000 - 0:05:30.480000::Small and short.
0:05:30.480000 - 0:05:31.480000::Oh, nice.
0:05:31.480000 - 0:05:32.480000::Yeah.
0:05:32.480000 - 0:05:34.480000::Everybody's got a store these days.
0:05:34.480000 - 0:05:36.480000::You tell me, man, are we shrinking?
0:05:36.480000 - 0:05:37.480000::Is this one size?
0:05:37.480000 - 0:05:39.480000::The skinniest shortest man is.
0:05:39.480000 - 0:05:40.480000::Hmm.
0:05:40.480000 - 0:05:42.480000::Let's think of who the shortest skinniest one.
0:05:42.480000 - 0:05:44.480000::We're not going to get disrespectful with this.
0:05:44.480000 - 0:05:45.480000::No, it's not this one.
0:05:45.480000 - 0:05:46.480000::Why is it this one?
0:05:46.480000 - 0:05:47.480000::It's just like,
0:05:47.480000 - 0:05:48.480000::World culture is so crazy.
0:05:48.480000 - 0:05:51.480000::I can't literally say somebody's height and weight.
0:05:51.480000 - 0:05:55.480000::Is there anything more scientifically rude or unrealistic?
0:05:55.480000 - 0:06:01.240000::Any size, if you are literally any size of anything that we just want to say that we
0:06:01.240000 - 0:06:02.240000::love you whatever time.
0:06:02.240000 - 0:06:04.920000::We love to size your short.
0:06:04.920000 - 0:06:11.240000::If you are big, if you are medium, if you are medium, traditionally, hot and sexy as
0:06:11.240000 - 0:06:13.160000::fuck, we like you guys as well.
0:06:13.160000 - 0:06:17.800000::But we also like people who are traditionally, I'm not saying this, but just how the Hollywood
0:06:17.800000 - 0:06:20.680000::and media portrays people to be ugly.
0:06:20.680000 - 0:06:22.200000::We like those people as well.
0:06:22.200000 - 0:06:23.200000::All talking people.
0:06:23.200000 - 0:06:24.200000::I like ugly people.
0:06:24.200000 - 0:06:25.200000::I'll say it.
0:06:25.200000 - 0:06:28.840000::You hang out with the ugliest people I've ever seen.
0:06:28.840000 - 0:06:32.200000::I think people with boils and whores and all type of disfigureations.
0:06:32.200000 - 0:06:33.200000::Yeah, clay and iron.
0:06:33.200000 - 0:06:37.920000::I surround myself with them physically.
0:06:37.920000 - 0:06:41.760000::And I'll say this, give me any celebrities weight and I'll guess it.
0:06:41.760000 - 0:06:48.880000::Well, if we tell you the weight then, I mean, all right, let's do an easy one.
0:06:48.880000 - 0:06:49.880000::Guess what?
0:06:49.880000 - 0:06:50.880000::Where do we give you a weight?
0:06:50.880000 - 0:06:57.560000::Yes, it's a clean one, a very mussely one, 73.
0:06:57.560000 - 0:06:59.080000::Crispine way too high.
0:06:59.080000 - 0:07:00.080000::He's 156.
0:07:00.080000 - 0:07:01.080000::He's 150.
0:07:01.080000 - 0:07:04.120000::No, how is that like Googleable knowledge?
0:07:04.120000 - 0:07:06.120000::It tells you in kilograms.
0:07:06.120000 - 0:07:07.880000::I guess he's got that short.
0:07:07.880000 - 0:07:09.280000::He's got that yummy.
0:07:09.280000 - 0:07:10.280000::Yummy.

0:07:14.280000 - 0:07:15.280000::Yeah, Tom Cruise.

0:07:30 - 0:07:31.520000::movie that got in trouble for.
0:07:31.520000 - 0:07:32.520000::Oh, Ezra.
0:07:32.520000 - 0:07:33.520000::Ezra, whatever.
0:07:33.520000 - 0:07:34.520000::He loved that.
0:07:34.520000 - 0:07:36.080000::Tom Cruise loved movies so much.
0:07:36.080000 - 0:07:41.920000::He called the director and said you made a masterpiece.
0:07:41.920000 - 0:07:43.240000::So oh, you want me to guess?
0:07:43.240000 - 0:07:44.240000::Chris Pines, wait.
0:07:44.240000 - 0:07:45.240000::Chris Pines.
0:07:45.240000 - 0:07:46.240000::I know this.
0:07:46.240000 - 0:07:47.240000::One 81.
0:07:47.240000 - 0:07:48.240000::One 81.
0:07:48.240000 - 0:07:49.240000::No way.
0:07:49.240000 - 0:07:50.240000::Do you guys have before?
0:07:50.240000 - 0:07:51.240000::He is 172.
0:07:51.240000 - 0:07:52.240000::172.
0:07:52.240000 - 0:07:57.840000::Oh, I'm surprised you didn't do it in kilograms because you are, you don't agree with that.
0:07:57.840000 - 0:08:02.560000::Well, I think in the metric system, but I translate it so quickly to the imperial.
0:08:02.560000 - 0:08:03.560000::That's Chris Pines.
0:08:03.560000 - 0:08:06::Wait, is Imperial what we use?
0:08:06 - 0:08:07.520000::The, uh, Imperials?
0:08:07.520000 - 0:08:08.520000::I use my own system.
0:08:08.520000 - 0:08:09.520000::I can't even do anything.
0:08:09.520000 - 0:08:11.520000::Imperial's on a little bridge.
0:08:11.520000 - 0:08:12.520000::Brish.
0:08:12.520000 - 0:08:13.520000::Aye.
0:08:13.520000 - 0:08:19.320000::Wait, don't you guys think that Chris Pines is like too good looking up a guy that it kind

0:08:21.640000 - 0:08:26.080000::You're like, no, no one, who, when do you just walk around seeing somebody that looks
0:08:26.080000 - 0:08:27.840000::like Chris Pines?
0:08:27.840000 - 0:08:28.840000::You don't.
0:08:28.840000 - 0:08:29.840000::You just don't.
0:08:29.840000 - 0:08:30.840000::It's so unrealistic.
0:08:30.840000 - 0:08:34.760000::And I want to say to any of the casting people that are casting the Dungeons and Dragons
0:08:34.760000 - 0:08:41.360000::movies or whatever, just, we need to see ourselves in these movies.
0:08:41.360000 - 0:08:42.840000::And we're like, Chris Pines.
0:08:42.840000 - 0:08:43.840000::Right.
0:08:43.840000 - 0:08:45.760000::He's just, he's just too good to find.
0:08:45.760000 - 0:08:46.760000::He's too fine.
0:08:46.760000 - 0:08:47.760000::I can compliment someone.
0:08:47.760000 - 0:08:48.760000::You're too fine.
0:08:48.760000 - 0:08:53.120000::Chris Pines looks like, can you be like, well, you know, it, because by the way, you
0:08:53.120000 - 0:08:58.160000::saw him, why in the 50s and 40s, nobody had enough nourishment to be hot.
0:08:58.160000 - 0:08:59.160000::You know what I'm saying?
0:08:59.160000 - 0:09:03.680000::And so that's why we had the real, uh, we look at people back then.
0:09:03.680000 - 0:09:04.680000::That bow bar.
0:09:04.680000 - 0:09:05.680000::That's a very, whatever.
0:09:05.680000 - 0:09:09.160000::Carry, well, carry granite had it like that.
0:09:09.160000 - 0:09:11.760000::Remember, carry, brand, that's a guy.
0:09:12.600000 - 0:09:16.840000::Oh, yeah, carry, I'm thinking of, uh, look, look, you grant.
0:09:16.840000 - 0:09:17.880000::I mean, he was handsome.
0:09:17.880000 - 0:09:18.720000::He was handsome.
0:09:18.720000 - 0:09:19.720000::Look at that guy.
0:09:19.720000 - 0:09:20.720000::He's handsome.
0:09:20.720000 - 0:09:21.720000::He was handsome.
0:09:21.720000 - 0:09:22.720000::Carry.
0:09:22.720000 - 0:09:23.720000::Carry.
0:09:23.720000 - 0:09:24.720000::He looks like, he was classic.
0:09:24.720000 - 0:09:25.720000::He looks like George Clooney, really.
0:09:25.720000 - 0:09:27.720000::But he would be a character actor today.
0:09:27.720000 - 0:09:28.720000::I'm telling you that much.
0:09:28.720000 - 0:09:29.720000::Yeah.
0:09:29.720000 - 0:09:30.720000::He'd be like that.
0:09:30.720000 - 0:09:32.040000::The humpback and 300.
0:09:32.040000 - 0:09:36.880000::There needs to be more respect for character actors and they, we just, we are, we are
0:09:36.880000 - 0:09:37.880000::character.
0:09:37.880000 - 0:09:38.880000::I know.
0:09:38.880000 - 0:09:39.880000::I'm saying that.
0:09:39.880000 - 0:09:40.880000::That's a character.
0:09:40.880000 - 0:09:41.880000::Yeah.
0:09:41.880000 - 0:09:42.880000::I don't want to hear that term thrown around.
0:09:42.880000 - 0:09:43.880000::I disagree.
0:09:43.880000 - 0:09:48.400000::It implies a specific physical attribute or behavioral type, but it's a character.
0:09:48.400000 - 0:09:49.800000::Who do we glorify?
0:09:49.800000 - 0:09:53.040000::People that play themselves in every single movie.
0:09:53.040000 - 0:09:55.440000::You think that is easy.
0:09:55.440000 - 0:09:56.440000::That's easy.
0:09:56.440000 - 0:09:59.440000::We are doing like hunchback of Notre Dame style.
0:09:59.440000 - 0:10:00.440000::Like, yeah.

0:10:00 - 0:10:02.080000::full chain. I'm doing the reverse
0:10:02.080000 - 0:10:03.640000::hunchback where I got the belly out.
0:10:05 - 0:10:06.320000::The fucking chest and put it on
0:10:06.320000 - 0:10:08.320000::back 40 pounds or less three years
0:10:08.320000 - 0:10:09.680000::for a role in nobody's cast me in
0:10:09.680000 - 0:10:11.880000::you. Just you're preparing, but
0:10:11.880000 - 0:10:13.480000::you know it's good. I know I'm
0:10:13.480000 - 0:10:14.640000::broke actually. Well, what you do
0:10:14.640000 - 0:10:16.200000::is this is a great strategy. Look
0:10:16.200000 - 0:10:17.640000::at somebody who's on the rise. You
0:10:17.640000 - 0:10:19.240000::look at like I've been studying
0:10:19.240000 - 0:10:20.240000::personally, Mario Screli for the
0:10:20.240000 - 0:10:21.640000::last 10 years trying to get his
0:10:21.640000 - 0:10:22.920000::style and everything perfectly
0:10:22.920000 - 0:10:24.480000::done. Knowing your client's pick
0:10:24.480000 - 0:10:26.160000::is coming up. You're close. All I
0:10:26.160000 - 0:10:27.920000::need to do is lose about a couple
0:10:27.920000 - 0:10:29.960000::more skeletal bit of skeleton
0:10:29.960000 - 0:10:31.640000::weight bone mass and everything.
0:10:31.640000 - 0:10:33.520000::Yeah, lose some bones like well
0:10:33.520000 - 0:10:35.040000::Maryland man's in style so you can
0:10:35.040000 - 0:10:36.520000::do this else. But not not
0:10:36.520000 - 0:10:37.880000::sexually, but yeah. Yeah, yeah.
0:10:37.880000 - 0:10:40.520000::Of course. Let me say it. Just like
0:10:40.520000 - 0:10:42.640000::food and style and everything.
0:10:42.640000 - 0:10:44.560000::Things move in trends, right? And
0:10:44.560000 - 0:10:46.080000::things that are trendy one decade
0:10:46.080000 - 0:10:48::become the opposite of trendy the
0:10:48 - 0:10:49.520000::next decade. Say who right now is
0:10:49.520000 - 0:10:50.680000::very hot, right? It's Timothy
0:10:50.680000 - 0:10:52.160000::Shallame. Right. I'm thinking
0:10:52.160000 - 0:10:54.080000::10 years in the future. What's the
0:10:54.080000 - 0:10:56.040000::opposite of Timothy Shallame? If the
0:10:56.040000 - 0:10:58.440000::body top shot. You are the opposite.
0:10:58.440000 - 0:11:02.360000::The complete night and day opposite
0:11:02.360000 - 0:11:04.560000::of Timothy Shallame is Eric
0:11:04.560000 - 0:11:06.240000::Rahill just personality wise.
0:11:06.240000 - 0:11:07.320000::Right. Vod's.
0:11:07.320000 - 0:11:08.120000::Right.
0:11:08.120000 - 0:11:09.320000::Right.
0:11:09.320000 - 0:11:11.120000::Not chill at all.
0:11:11.120000 - 0:11:12.120000::Yeah.
0:11:12.120000 - 0:11:14.880000::Shallame, your time is up.
0:11:14.880000 - 0:11:15.640000::B.O.T.
0:11:15.640000 - 0:11:17.160000::Bye.
0:11:17.160000 - 0:11:20.320000::No, I do want to wish Timothy

0:11:23.240000 - 0:11:25.480000::new Wonka and we just know that
0:11:25.480000 - 0:11:27.120000::he's gonna crush that. He's playing
0:11:27.120000 - 0:11:29.120000::with Mr. Will. But is he? He's not gonna
0:11:29.120000 - 0:11:30.480000::do it better than Gene.
0:11:30.480000 - 0:11:32.640000::Why is he will? No, he won't.
0:11:32.640000 - 0:11:33.480000::Oh, you know what my
0:11:33.480000 - 0:11:35.560000::original wilder thing is. He was
0:11:35.560000 - 0:11:37.400000::saying in the rain and at him.
0:11:38.520000 - 0:11:40.400000::No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
0:11:40.400000 - 0:11:41.200000::That's Gene Kelly.

0:11:42.720000 - 0:11:43.720000::right?
0:11:43.720000 - 0:11:46.120000::Um, but no, Gene Wilder did this.
0:11:46.120000 - 0:11:47.760000::Uh, what will show? It's my favorite
0:11:47.760000 - 0:11:49.800000::thing I've ever seen.
0:11:49.800000 - 0:11:51.400000::Timothy Shallame, lowkey look like
0:11:51.400000 - 0:11:54.080000::a little ass Vegeta. Oh, shit.
0:11:55.080000 - 0:11:58.080000::He was in Alice in Wonderland. Oh, really?
0:11:58.080000 - 0:11:59.080000::Soup. Congrats.
0:11:59.080000 - 0:12:01.080000::And there's a part where he sings this song
0:12:01.080000 - 0:12:03.080000::called Beautiful Soup and he's a
0:12:03.080000 - 0:12:04.680000::little turtle and it goes like this.
0:12:04.680000 - 0:12:06.680000::This song has been stuck in my head
0:12:06.680000 - 0:12:08.320000::for I'm not kidding you. Seven years.
0:12:08.320000 - 0:12:10.320000::You probably heard me singing it goes like this.
0:12:10.320000 - 0:12:17.320000::Beautiful soup. So rich and green.
0:12:17.320000 - 0:12:20.560000::Made in a hot,
0:12:20.560000 - 0:12:23.720000::touring soup of the evening.
0:12:23.720000 - 0:12:24.960000::Dude, dude, what?
0:12:24.960000 - 0:12:27.720000::Super the evening beautiful soup.
0:12:27.720000 - 0:12:31.560000::And then it goes like beautiful soup.
0:12:31.560000 - 0:12:35.800000::Beauty. I have a feeling that when you are
0:12:35.800000 - 0:12:38.880000::what's a terrain? That's like a big pot, dude.
0:12:38.880000 - 0:12:41.440000::Eric, when you are going to be 90
0:12:41.440000 - 0:12:45.040000::eight years old and you have lost all like motor function,
0:12:45.040000 - 0:12:46.560000::it's going to be like everyone's
0:12:46.560000 - 0:12:47.960000::your grandkids are going to visit you
0:12:47.960000 - 0:12:48.960000::and they're going to be like,
0:12:48.960000 - 0:12:49.960000::you don't recognize them at all.
0:12:49.960000 - 0:12:50.960000::And you're going to be like,
0:12:50.960000 - 0:12:52.960000::beautiful soup.
0:12:52.960000 - 0:12:54.960000::And they're like, what the fuck is going on?
0:12:54.960000 - 0:12:56.960000::I want everybody to look up Gene Wilder,
0:12:56.960000 - 0:12:58.960000::Beautiful Soup and watch this because this song
0:12:58.960000 - 0:13:02.960000::is somehow the most catchiest thing I've ever heard.
0:13:02.960000 - 0:13:03.960000::And you're not going to believe the idea
0:13:03.960000 - 0:13:05.960000::that just came into my head.
0:13:05.960000 - 0:13:06.960000::You probably don't even want me to say it
0:13:06.960000 - 0:13:08.960000::because it's so off the beaten path.
0:13:08.960000 - 0:13:09.960000::Let's move on then.
0:13:12.960000 - 0:13:13.960000::All right. It's just a big matter.
0:13:13.960000 - 0:13:15.960000::Well, you just, you just,
0:13:16.960000 - 0:13:19.960000::I thought about you being in an elderly home and whatnot
0:13:19.960000 - 0:13:21.960000::and I'm singing that thing for a childhood
0:13:21.960000 - 0:13:23.960000::and I thought, wouldn't it be nice
0:13:23.960000 - 0:13:26.960000::if human beings and you got old,
0:13:26.960000 - 0:13:27.960000::you got little buttons all over you
0:13:27.960000 - 0:13:31.960000::that let you kind of say something from each age?
0:13:31.960000 - 0:13:33.960000::Dude, that is,
0:13:33.960000 - 0:13:34.960000::I'm saying that.
0:13:34.960000 - 0:13:36.960000::You have the dumbest and greatest ideas
0:13:36.960000 - 0:13:37.960000::I've ever heard you have.
0:13:37.960000 - 0:13:39.960000::Likes from the universe ideas.
0:13:39.960000 - 0:13:41.960000::Wait, somebody else can poke it on you?
0:13:41.960000 - 0:13:42.960000::Like 56.
0:13:42.960000 - 0:13:43.960000::Hey, hey.
0:13:44.960000 - 0:13:45.960000::I want to know my car.
0:13:45.960000 - 0:13:46.960000::My car. Yeah.
0:13:46.960000 - 0:13:47.960000::Cars stuck again.
0:13:49.960000 - 0:13:50.960000::Dude, what the hell that?
0:13:53.960000 - 0:13:55.960000::That's why I'm such a hard time talking to everybody
0:13:55.960000 - 0:13:57.960000::because I just, yeah, insecure because
0:13:57.960000 - 0:14:01.960000::I'm entrepreneurializing every second of the day.
0:14:01.960000 - 0:14:03.960000::Literally, it's fucking annoying.
0:14:03.960000 - 0:14:07.960000::It's a personal museum's like interactive science museums.
0:14:07.960000 - 0:14:10.960000::Yeah, biological, biological age museum.
0:14:10.960000 - 0:14:11.960000::I'm so glad that you all.
0:14:11.960000 - 0:14:14.960000::I just told you about a button that you can put inside your skin.
0:14:14.960000 - 0:14:15.960000::Oh, yeah.
0:14:15.960000 - 0:14:16.960000::So I really know.
0:14:16.960000 - 0:14:18.960000::I have a sleep apnea.
0:14:18.960000 - 0:14:21.960000::Many people suffer from this and it's not because of weight.
0:14:21.960000 - 0:14:22.960000::And,
0:14:24.960000 - 0:14:29.960000::and I keep getting these ads for this alternative
0:14:29.960000 - 0:14:32.960000::to CPAT machines, which is like a button.
0:14:32.960000 - 0:14:34.960000::They go into your neck,
0:14:34.960000 - 0:14:36.960000::put a slice into your neck.
0:14:36.960000 - 0:14:37.960000::They do something where they attach
0:14:37.960000 - 0:14:40.960000::like an electrical current to one of your muscles.
0:14:40.960000 - 0:14:43.960000::That like, it's a low level electrical current that goes
0:14:43.960000 - 0:14:47.960000::and like weakens your muscle that causes the throat to collapse
0:14:47.960000 - 0:14:48.960000::and sleep apnea.
0:14:48.960000 - 0:14:49.960000::Collapse.
0:14:49.960000 - 0:14:50.960000::Whatever that makes you snore.
0:14:50.960000 - 0:14:51.960000::Yeah.
0:14:51.960000 - 0:14:55.960000::And to turn it on, you push a button inside of your skin
0:14:55.960000 - 0:14:56.960000::and then you go,

0:15:37.320000 - 0:15:39.880000::They can they've been burned in the past
0:15:39.880000 - 0:15:42.120000::and they can't take that technological leap.
0:15:42.120000 - 0:15:46::Our our version of that is going to be this the sub dermal

0:18:02.360000 - 0:18:05.960000::That's different like a book a book a teeny spaghetti.
0:18:05.960000 - 0:18:09.440000::Yeah, kind of, but your fingers are there a hole in the front of it or
0:18:09.440000 - 0:18:10.440000::is it just on the top?
0:18:10.440000 - 0:18:11.440000::It's like a glove on the top.
0:18:11.440000 - 0:18:12.960000::Wait, what are you talking about?
0:18:12.960000 - 0:18:16.280000::Your whole finger is hollow and there's a hole at the top.

0:18:21.080000 - 0:18:23::This doesn't fuck with me.
0:18:23 - 0:18:26.080000::Because hold on, if I had a hole, if my finger was hollow, what I do is I drill
0:18:26.080000 - 0:18:27.080000::one on the top.
0:18:27.080000 - 0:18:28.080000::That's my carb.
0:18:28.080000 - 0:18:29.080000::I spark it up.
0:18:29.080000 - 0:18:36.080000::You don't know what it's like getting high out of your own hand.

0:18:41.960000 - 0:18:43.960000::Put a little bit of weed in your mouth.
0:18:43.960000 - 0:18:45.960000::Plug your ear like this.
0:18:45.960000 - 0:18:47.960000::Put the mouth on the other ear.
0:18:47.960000 - 0:18:49.960000::What are you like in that?
0:18:49.960000 - 0:18:51.920000::You suck, you're light in the mouth.
0:18:51.920000 - 0:18:53.920000::You're sucking on my ear and I'm closing this one.
0:18:53.920000 - 0:18:57.120000::Oh, suck on your brain.

0:18:58.120000 - 0:19:00.040000::You can literally smoke out of anything.
0:19:00.040000 - 0:19:02::You could smoke out of your best friend.
0:19:02 - 0:19:03::You know what?
0:19:03 - 0:19:04.720000::That's a great idea.
0:19:04.720000 - 0:19:08::I know you could smoke, you could smoke out of your hand like this, but that's boring.
0:19:08 - 0:19:09::Yeah, that's...
0:19:09 - 0:19:10::Yeah, anybody can do that.
0:19:10 - 0:19:12::I would smoke out of somebody else's skull.
0:19:12 - 0:19:13::You know what was living?
0:19:13 - 0:19:14::You know what was living?
0:19:14 - 0:19:16.640000::Doing shit like this was probably the cake back in the day when we didn't have a glass
0:19:16.640000 - 0:19:17.640000::or anything.
0:19:17.640000 - 0:19:22.160000::We're probably using bones and probably using crazy shit to smoke herbs.
0:19:22.160000 - 0:19:23.160000::Oh, of course.
0:19:23.160000 - 0:19:26.840000::Thinking about it's time that when we don't have glasses scaring me to a hell of a back.
0:19:26.840000 - 0:19:30.840000::And do you guys know this guy who did all this plastic surgery to look like an alien?
0:19:30.840000 - 0:19:33.840000::Oh, you're using it right now.
0:19:33.840000 - 0:19:35.080000::Oh, look at this guy.
0:19:35.080000 - 0:19:36.080000::Oh my God.
0:19:36.080000 - 0:19:37.560000::And he chopped off his fingers.
0:19:37.560000 - 0:19:38.560000::That looks like Nate when he took it off.
0:19:38.560000 - 0:19:39.560000::And now we have two fingers.
0:19:39.560000 - 0:19:40.560000::He removes his fingers.
0:19:40.560000 - 0:19:41.560000::Oh.
0:19:41.560000 - 0:19:42.560000::He's only got two of them.
0:19:42.560000 - 0:19:43.560000::And now he has two fingers.
0:19:43.560000 - 0:19:44.560000::He's got a little claw.
0:19:44.560000 - 0:19:45.560000::He's got a little claw.
0:19:45.560000 - 0:19:46.560000::And a thumb.
0:19:46.920000 - 0:19:48.920000::I got a song for him.
0:19:48.920000 - 0:19:51.920000::So sick of fingers.
0:19:51.920000 - 0:19:56.040000::I got a song to be you look motherfucking weird dude.
0:19:56.040000 - 0:19:58.040000::Why don't you look normal?
0:19:58.040000 - 0:19:59.040000::I know, man.
0:19:59.040000 - 0:20:00.040000::I know.

0:20:00 - 0:20:01.540000::to hell with that.
0:20:01.540000 - 0:20:02.380000::Well, you know what?
0:20:02.380000 - 0:20:04.180000::Not to hell with that.
0:20:04.180000 - 0:20:05.500000::Congratulations.
0:20:05.500000 - 0:20:08.180000::Because it sounds like you are loving how you look.
0:20:08.180000 - 0:20:09.740000::I'm jealous of people that can just
0:20:09.740000 - 0:20:11.260000::do something like that.
0:20:11.260000 - 0:20:15.460000::Like look so incredibly unique.
0:20:15.460000 - 0:20:17.020000::They don't even give a fuck away.
0:20:17.020000 - 0:20:19.100000::Anyone thinks, because people say that,
0:20:19.100000 - 0:20:20.980000::I don't care what anybody thinks about me,
0:20:20.980000 - 0:20:23.060000::then go ahead and make yourself an alien.
0:20:23.060000 - 0:20:24.560000::If that's the case.
0:20:24.560000 - 0:20:29.060000::Literally glue elbows together behind your back and get,
0:20:29.980000 - 0:20:32.900000::get the fucking chicken wing piercing that goes one
0:20:32.900000 - 0:20:35.380000::hearing through both your elbows behind your back
0:20:35.380000 - 0:20:36.660000::and then come tell me that you don't care
0:20:36.660000 - 0:20:37.860000::what other people think.
0:20:37.860000 - 0:20:40.460000::Because we as ourselves, we claim to be outsiders, right?
0:20:40.460000 - 0:20:41.300000::We're artists.
0:20:41.300000 - 0:20:42.300000::I've always claimed that.
0:20:42.300000 - 0:20:43.420000::Whatever you call that.
0:20:43.420000 - 0:20:48.420000::Eric, for $100,000, would you do the thing
0:20:48.820000 - 0:20:51.180000::where your nipples are pierced,
0:20:51.180000 - 0:20:53.020000::your belly button is pierced?
0:20:53.020000 - 0:20:54.940000::You have piercing on your eyebrows
0:20:54.940000 - 0:20:56.860000::and it is attached to the ceiling
0:20:56.860000 - 0:20:58.900000::and you are hanging down from there.
0:20:58.900000 - 0:21:01.660000::For three days without food or water.
0:21:01.660000 - 0:21:03.540000::No, no, no, for how much?
0:21:03.540000 - 0:21:04.380000::I wouldn't.
0:21:04.380000 - 0:21:06.700000::100,000, 100,000 times.
0:21:06.700000 - 0:21:07.820000::Times that by.
0:21:07.820000 - 0:21:08.660000::I would do that with food.
0:21:08.660000 - 0:21:09.660000::Food.
0:21:09.660000 - 0:21:10.660000::To.
0:21:10.660000 - 0:21:11.660000::With food.
0:21:11.660000 - 0:21:12.660000::I can have food.
0:21:12.660000 - 0:21:13.900000::Can I have any food I want?
0:21:13.900000 - 0:21:14.900000::Yeah, yeah.
0:21:14.900000 - 0:21:17.220000::Yeah, that's an area you can have any type of food
0:21:17.220000 - 0:21:18.060000::that you want.
0:21:18.060000 - 0:21:20.220000::If someone's giving these fucking chicken wings
0:21:20.220000 - 0:21:21.300000::and spanked my legs and legs.
0:21:21.300000 - 0:21:22.140000::There's no toilet.
0:21:22.140000 - 0:21:24.220000::Anything you gotta shout all over the floor.
0:21:24.220000 - 0:21:25.820000::Is that all right?

0:26:03.920000 - 0:26:04.920000::on the team.
0:26:04.920000 - 0:26:10.080000::She's got you don't want to mess with a judge named Judy, but Judd Judy is kind of bad.
0:26:10.080000 - 0:26:11.080000::What do you mean?
0:26:11.080000 - 0:26:12.080000::She's kind of bad.

0:26:32.960000 - 0:26:37.360000::can make so much money and have such longevity with.
0:26:37.360000 - 0:26:44.200000::And we are one sort of law degree from taking over that whole sector of daytime TV point
0:26:44.200000 - 0:26:47.200000::at a good point.
0:26:47.200000 - 0:26:48.520000::I would go back to law school.
0:26:48.520000 - 0:26:49.520000::Law school.

0:27:05.160000 - 0:27:07.400000::It takes 10 years just to enter the race.
0:27:07.400000 - 0:27:09.600000::That is way longer than a law degree.
0:27:09.600000 - 0:27:11.960000::What you guys are what your guys is years in comedy.
0:27:11.960000 - 0:27:12.960000::I don't do years.
0:27:12.960000 - 0:27:15.960000::I do hours and I'm at some like six hundred.
0:27:15.960000 - 0:27:18.600000::Practice because when I get off stage, I'm doing my head.

0:48:14.940000 - 0:48:18.460000::Jack, me and Max are all moving to New York in 2018.
0:48:18.460000 - 0:48:20.220000::We're happening in the RV.
0:48:20.220000 - 0:48:21.180000::Everybody's crying.
0:48:21.180000 - 0:48:22.460000::Our friends are out there.

0:48:22.940000 - 0:48:24.060000::We're in the alley.
0:48:24.060000 - 0:48:28.780000::It's the most blue, clear sky day you've ever seen in your life.
0:48:28.780000 - 0:48:29.660000::It's hottest fuck.
0:48:29.660000 - 0:48:30.380000::It's August.
0:48:31.340000 - 0:48:31.660000::Nope.
0:48:31.660000 - 0:48:33.020000::Not a cloud in the sky.
0:48:33.740000 - 0:48:37.260000::And Rubin is for some reason standing around like chilling with us all
0:48:37.260000 - 0:48:39.420000::as like we're crying hugging saying goodbye.
0:48:39.420000 - 0:48:40.380000::Why was he there?
0:48:40.380000 - 0:48:41.020000::I don't know.
0:48:41.020000 - 0:48:42.060000::I think he was aging.
0:48:42.060000 - 0:48:43.020000::He was.
0:48:43.020000 - 0:48:46.300000::Rubin is probably 60 for now.
0:48:46.300000 - 0:48:48.700000::He would smoke cigars in our basement all the time
0:48:48.700000 - 0:48:51.260000::and like drink liquor down there by himself.
0:48:51.260000 - 0:48:53.020000::And like just come up and say what's up.
0:48:53.020000 - 0:48:55.020000::And the basement was disgusting.
0:48:55.020000 - 0:48:57.020000::He was like the last of those concrete.
0:48:57.020000 - 0:48:57.900000::It was not disgusting.
0:48:57.900000 - 0:48:59.660000::The basement was kind of like he kind of hooked it up
0:48:59.660000 - 0:49:00.940000::so he could have a good time down there.
0:49:00.940000 - 0:49:03.260000::Oh, he was like his, his like quiet zone.
0:49:03.260000 - 0:49:05.020000::A little bathroom for he reflected.
0:49:05.020000 - 0:49:08.300000::But he's in a moment of silence for whoever that siren's headed for.
0:49:08.300000 - 0:49:08.780000::Right.
0:49:08.780000 - 0:49:10.620000::There's a siren in the background right now.
0:49:10.620000 - 0:49:12.380000::There we know that something bad.
0:49:12.380000 - 0:49:14.220000::Somebody's not in a good way.
0:49:16.220000 - 0:49:16.540000::Sweet.

0:49:20.060000 - 0:49:21.020000::They probably came in here.
0:49:21.020000 - 0:49:21.820000::Yeah, for sure.
0:49:21.820000 - 0:49:22.140000::Okay.
0:49:22.140000 - 0:49:24.220000::So what happens is Rubin standing there
0:49:24.220000 - 0:49:26.780000::leaning against the like you know a house
0:49:26.780000 - 0:49:28.620000::or wherever next to the alley.
0:49:28.620000 - 0:49:31.260000::And there's a pipe that is dripping.
0:49:31.260000 - 0:49:32.780000::He's going like, man, what the hell?
0:49:32.780000 - 0:49:33.500000::It's raining.
0:49:33.500000 - 0:49:35.420000::Why you guys feel this rain?
0:49:35.420000 - 0:49:38.380000::And there's a little like gutter that's sticking out.
0:49:38.380000 - 0:49:41.020000::It's dropping single droplets onto his head.
0:49:41.020000 - 0:49:42.140000::And he's like, what the hell?
0:49:42.140000 - 0:49:44.220000::He's like, cannot believe that it's raining.
0:49:44.220000 - 0:49:46.940000::And we're all starting to cry laughing at him saying
0:49:46.940000 - 0:49:48.140000::that it's raining because the pipe
0:49:48.140000 - 0:49:49.580000::was just dropping single droplets.
0:49:49.580000 - 0:49:52.780000::And then we like realize it was his thing where it was like,
0:49:52.780000 - 0:49:54.300000::why aren't you moving out of the way?
0:49:54.300000 - 0:49:55.100000::Yeah, yeah.
0:49:55.100000 - 0:49:57.180000::This is like we all laugh.
0:49:57.180000 - 0:49:58.620000::And he's still just standing there.
0:49:58.620000 - 0:49:59.980000::It was making you know.

0:50:00 - 0:50:02.600000::I don't know, you didn't think that was funny.
0:50:02.600000 - 0:50:03.640000::Nate.

0:50:05.400000 - 0:50:10.240000::No, I am trying to think of what gave me joy this week.
0:50:10.240000 - 0:50:13.080000::Remembering that moment just gave me joy.
0:50:13.080000 - 0:50:13.880000::That's my joy.
0:50:13.880000 - 0:50:14.720000::That's your joy.
0:50:14.720000 - 0:50:17.080000::Do you want to brainstorm with us about what gave you joy this week?
0:50:17.080000 - 0:50:18.080000::Yeah, let's see here.
0:50:18.080000 - 0:50:19.080000::I was gonna say over it.
0:50:19.080000 - 0:50:21.360000::How about what you wore yesterday when we saw you?
0:50:21.360000 - 0:50:22.360000::Oh, yeah.
0:50:22.360000 - 0:50:24.960000::So sometimes I will do this when I,

0:50:29.040000 - 0:50:32.240000::I'm coming up with a short film that's gonna basically change how people perceive me
0:50:32.240000 - 0:50:37.480000::and gonna put me into it, an uprash line of creatives in the world and it's gonna kind of
0:50:37.480000 - 0:50:38.480000::shock the system.
0:50:38.480000 - 0:50:42.880000::So anyways, I'm working on the script right now and it's going swimmingly.
0:50:42.880000 - 0:50:49.800000::And when I write, I like to dress up sometimes, like put on something, you know, a dress for
0:50:49.800000 - 0:50:50.800000::the JVM.
0:50:50.800000 - 0:50:54.200000::I swear to God, I'll be in my apartment and put on a full suit.

0:51:03.760000 - 0:51:05.880000::And I went there at about nine p.m.
0:51:05.880000 - 0:51:09.800000::This is how Bayes is getting his steps to eccentricity and you're gonna be the most eccentric
0:51:09.800000 - 0:51:10.800000::way.
0:51:10.800000 - 0:51:14.120000::But it makes you feel like when you're at the laptop, like, oh shit, like I better make
0:51:14.120000 - 0:51:19.360000::something happen because I'm dressed up, you know, it's funny, but it changes your perception
0:51:19.360000 - 0:51:22.160000::of how you approach the work.
0:51:22.160000 - 0:51:26.840000::And you were wearing kind of a, all-based, all-based tucked in dresser.
0:51:26.840000 - 0:51:32.480000::Your head to toe beige, I'm not going to you hat beige, suit beige, pants beige, shoes
0:51:32.480000 - 0:51:37::were dusty and white, but they looked beige because they were so dusty and f**king old
0:51:37 - 0:51:38::beige.
