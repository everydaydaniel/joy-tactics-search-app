0:01:02.240000 - 0:01:04.240000::We allow them to keep that on our sleeves.
0:01:04.240000 - 0:01:05.240000::It's not classy.

0:01:33.240000 - 0:01:37.240000::How come whenever I see a baddie, I want to see the goodies.
0:01:37.240000 - 0:01:38.240000::Oh.
0:01:38.240000 - 0:01:39.240000::Curious.

0:01:40.240000 - 0:01:41.240000::Yeah.
0:01:41.240000 - 0:01:43.240000::That felt so bad to say.
0:01:43.240000 - 0:01:44.240000::Oh, that's a lot of work.
0:01:44.240000 - 0:01:46.240000::Oh, I see where you're saying you're being dirty.
0:01:46.240000 - 0:01:48.240000::No, I'm just saying.
0:01:48.240000 - 0:01:50.240000::And I'm honestly not meaning to be naughty.
0:01:50.240000 - 0:01:57.240000::I'm just making a basically a, I saw the alley right there for that little play on words.
0:01:57.240000 - 0:02:01.240000::I should go down the drain back in the back in the old time.
0:02:01.240000 - 0:02:02.240000::The area.
0:02:02.240000 - 0:02:03.240000::Yeah.
0:02:03.240000 - 0:02:04.240000::Fellows were just like.
0:02:04.240000 - 0:02:05.240000::Come on.

0:02:07.240000 - 0:02:08.240000::Right.
0:02:08.240000 - 0:02:09.240000::Like there was a different type of horniness.
0:02:09.240000 - 0:02:10.240000::They had no chill.
0:02:10.240000 - 0:02:11.240000::Tunish.
0:02:11.240000 - 0:02:12.240000::They had no chill.
0:02:12.240000 - 0:02:13.240000::Come on.
0:02:13.240000 - 0:02:14.240000::Come on.
0:02:14.240000 - 0:02:17.240000::You know, and they were built like and looked like Frank Sinatra.
0:02:17.240000 - 0:02:20.240000::Frank Sinatra was a fucking bombshell.
0:02:20.240000 - 0:02:22.240000::You know, I'm saying that was a heartthrob.
0:02:22.240000 - 0:02:23.240000::Look at his ass.
0:02:23.240000 - 0:02:24.240000::Yeah.
0:02:24.240000 - 0:02:26.240000::Did he have unlimited talent and charisma?
0:02:26.240000 - 0:02:27.240000::Sure.
0:02:27.240000 - 0:02:28.240000::Did he have a golden voice?
0:02:28.240000 - 0:02:29.240000::Yeah.
0:02:29.240000 - 0:02:32.240000::Did he have a resilience against a turbulent career?
0:02:32.240000 - 0:02:33.240000::Yeah.
0:02:33.240000 - 0:02:34.240000::He did.
0:02:34.240000 - 0:02:37.240000::Was he the perfect voice for the 40s, 50s and 60s and beyond?
0:02:37.240000 - 0:02:38.240000::Yeah.
0:02:38.240000 - 0:02:39.240000::He was.
0:02:39.240000 - 0:02:41.240000::But was he fine like that?
0:02:41.240000 - 0:02:42.240000::No.
0:02:42.240000 - 0:02:46.240000::Did he deserve to be dating and be married to and having a fair with Ava Gardener?
0:02:46.240000 - 0:02:50.240000::Hell nah, based on his looks.
0:02:50.240000 - 0:02:53.240000::Eric Grayhill, the Frank Sinatra scholar.
0:02:53.240000 - 0:02:54.240000::Always appreciated.
0:02:54.240000 - 0:02:56.240000::Always classy man.
0:02:56.240000 - 0:03:01.240000::I mean, have you seen a picture of Frank Sinatra and Ava Gardener together?
0:03:01.240000 - 0:03:04.240000::Yeah, on my bedroom wall.
0:03:04.240000 - 0:03:07.240000::You know who had no idea what the beauty of the rat pack.
0:03:07.240000 - 0:03:08.240000::Who?
0:03:08.240000 - 0:03:09.240000::You know what I mean?
0:03:09.240000 - 0:03:10.240000::Davis, Jr.
0:03:10.240000 - 0:03:14.240000::Well, yes, but who I was thinking of is Dean Martin.
0:03:14.240000 - 0:03:15.240000::Oh, yeah.
0:03:15.240000 - 0:03:16.240000::Yeah.
0:03:16.240000 - 0:03:19.240000::Martin had the ladies.
0:03:19.240000 - 0:03:20.240000::He had a wet.
0:03:20.240000 - 0:03:22.240000::He had a, he had the 40s.
0:03:22.240000 - 0:03:23.240000::Oh, man.
0:03:23.240000 - 0:03:24.240000::The 40s were wet, man.
0:03:24.240000 - 0:03:25.240000::The girls were there.
0:03:25.240000 - 0:03:26.240000::Where are they wearing back then?
0:03:26.240000 - 0:03:27.240000::Gertles and stuff.
0:03:27.240000 - 0:03:28.240000::Yeah.
0:03:28.240000 - 0:03:29.240000::Oh, they had to wear two girdles back then.
0:03:29.240000 - 0:03:30.240000::Where is a girdle?
0:03:30.240000 - 0:03:31.240000::What even is a girdle?
0:03:31.240000 - 0:03:32.240000::I don't know what that is.
0:03:32.240000 - 0:03:33.240000::So what time you have a garment?
0:03:33.240000 - 0:03:34.240000::It's a garment.
0:03:34.240000 - 0:03:35.240000::I'm sure Gertle.
0:03:35.240000 - 0:03:36.240000::Gertle.
0:03:36.240000 - 0:03:37.240000::Gertle.
0:03:37.240000 - 0:03:38.240000::Gertle.
0:03:38.240000 - 0:03:39.240000::In the 40s.
0:03:39.240000 - 0:03:40.240000::Oh, you could see you needed a tissue.
0:03:40.240000 - 0:03:41.240000::Around, back then.
0:03:41.240000 - 0:03:50.240000::You see somebody walking by who's attractive.
0:03:50.240000 - 0:03:52.240000::You got five friends right next to you.
0:03:52.240000 - 0:03:54.240000::Three of them probably dropped dead.
0:03:54.240000 - 0:03:56.240000::Everybody knew somebody back then that just died.
0:03:56.240000 - 0:04:02.540000::Just saw somebody that was so fine that they said, if I can't be with them, I'd rather be
0:04:02.540000 - 0:04:03.540000::with the creator.
0:04:03.540000 - 0:04:07.240000::Right there on the motherfucking hoagie line.
0:04:07.240000 - 0:04:11.360000::And by the way, if I was in the 40s and I saw Dean Martin, the floor would be getting wet
0:04:11.360000 - 0:04:16.240000::from my pee because I'd be so nervous to be around a great like him.
0:04:16.240000 - 0:04:17.240000::You know what I mean?
0:04:17.240000 - 0:04:18.240000::Yes.
0:04:18.240000 - 0:04:19.240000::Hello, sir.
0:04:19.240000 - 0:04:20.240000::Right.
0:04:20.240000 - 0:04:21.240000::Like a dog.
0:04:21.240000 - 0:04:22.240000::Like when you see your dog.
0:04:22.240000 - 0:04:23.240000::A submissive.
0:04:23.240000 - 0:04:25.240000::I would be so submissive to Mr. Dean Martin.
0:04:25.240000 - 0:04:26.240000::Oh, you are a social sub.
0:04:26.240000 - 0:04:31.240000::I used to be submissive out of respect.
0:04:31.240000 - 0:04:35.240000::Out of respect for his voice.
0:04:35.240000 - 0:04:39.400000::And if you know what's funny and interesting to me, as we go, sorry, everybody, we're going
0:04:39.400000 - 0:04:41.080000::to talk about the dames.
0:04:41.080000 - 0:04:43::We're going to talk about the broads.
0:04:43 - 0:04:44.720000::Well, so far we haven't.
0:04:44.720000 - 0:04:49.360000::We've talked about the men and I don't know that that's going to change.
0:04:49.360000 - 0:04:52.080000::I mean, hey, look right behind me.
0:04:52.080000 - 0:04:54.160000::That's a dead guy who's hot as a fox.
0:04:54.160000 - 0:04:58.240000::For those who don't know, that's Victor Hara.
0:04:58.240000 - 0:04:59.960000::Victor Hara.

0:05:00 - 0:05:03.720000::He was murdered by the government on 9-11-17, 1973.
0:05:03.720000 - 0:05:07.280000::Yep, you didn't know there's a lot of 9-11s out there.
0:05:07.280000 - 0:05:08.280000::Who is that?
0:05:08.280000 - 0:05:10.280000::Yeah, sorry, I'm sorry, man.
0:05:10.280000 - 0:05:14.120000::Yeah, but what is, what's his deal?
0:05:14.120000 - 0:05:20.680000::He is a Chilean musician who has passed, who was made some beautiful, beautiful, just
0:05:20.680000 - 0:05:28.160000::love songs back in the day, a lot of acoustic guitar, and then a lot of really evocative and
0:05:28.160000 - 0:05:34.800000::beautiful political music that was so evocative during this election back in the day that when
0:05:34.800000 - 0:05:42.080000::this coup happened, they basically came in that fucking dude took over IND or whatever,
0:05:42.080000 - 0:05:45.520000::somebody else, somebody took over and bombed the shit out of everybody.
0:05:45.520000 - 0:05:49.320000::They're rounding up all these supporters in a soccer stadium or something.
0:05:49.320000 - 0:05:54.920000::They bring Victor Harra in and what do they do in front of everybody in the whole stadium?
0:05:54.920000 - 0:05:56.400000::Because his music was so good.
0:05:56.400000 - 0:05:57.400000::They killed it.
0:05:57.520000 - 0:06:00.640000::First they cut his fingers off so he could never play guitar again.
0:06:00.640000 - 0:06:02.880000::No, then they took him out back.
0:06:04.720000 - 0:06:06.960000::They cut his fingers off and then killed him.
0:06:06.960000 - 0:06:08.240000::Now that seems cruel.
0:06:08.240000 - 0:06:13.200000::And his wife is still around and she has a nice documentary and a book and stuff.
0:06:13.200000 - 0:06:16.200000::But their music is, his music is fucking amazing.
0:06:16.200000 - 0:06:17.080000::I'm going to look at him.
0:06:17.080000 - 0:06:21.640000::I'm afraid, Nate, be careful when you listen to that music because you're going to want to be
0:06:21.640000 - 0:06:25.760000::in a zone in your life where you can get shit down because I know the minute you pop
0:06:25.760000 - 0:06:28.160000::that music on your earphones.
0:06:28.160000 - 0:06:30.320000::You're going to be starting a revolution.
0:06:30.320000 - 0:06:31.720000::Well, let me shout out two songs.
0:06:31.720000 - 0:06:32.840000::If I may, I know.

0:16:22.660000 - 0:16:24.180000::Are you kidding me?
0:16:24.180000 - 0:16:25.020000::Nothing.
0:16:25.100000 - 0:16:25.860000::You would love.
0:16:25.860000 - 0:16:30.860000::I'm gonna type who it is in the chat.
0:16:33.300000 - 0:16:36.260000::Nate, I'm getting a vision of you near end of life.
0:16:36.260000 - 0:16:37.500000::You had this point.
0:16:37.500000 - 0:16:39.420000::You've lost the function of your legs.
0:16:39.420000 - 0:16:42.980000::You're in a wheelchair and you are getting crowd-served
0:16:42.980000 - 0:16:43.820000::through.
0:16:43.820000 - 0:16:45.660000::It's like a packed out thing and you're on the chair
0:16:45.660000 - 0:16:49.180000::just getting crowd-served right on the stage.
0:16:49.180000 - 0:16:51.380000::Taiman Paula hands you a mic and you sing the rest
0:16:51.380000 - 0:16:52.940000::of the fucking concert.
0:16:53.020000 - 0:16:55.860000::And then you pass away on stage, Crumple.
0:16:55.860000 - 0:16:58.540000::I would be, that sounds incredible, man.
0:16:58.540000 - 0:17:01.660000::You're last, that's how, my last moment,
0:17:01.660000 - 0:17:03.940000::singing our fucking borderline.
0:17:03.940000 - 0:17:05.420000::Yeah.
0:17:05.420000 - 0:17:06.940000::Nate, did you see the chat?
0:17:06.940000 - 0:17:07.780000::Yes.
0:17:07.780000 - 0:17:10.380000::That's incredible.
0:17:10.380000 - 0:17:11.540000::I love that.
0:17:11.540000 - 0:17:14.620000::It's so, you're aiming to have a song like that.
0:17:14.620000 - 0:17:15.780000::It's just, you know what it is?
0:17:15.780000 - 0:17:17.140000::It's pop music.
0:17:17.140000 - 0:17:21.420000::I think at the end of the day, I really like somebody who can,
0:17:22.300000 - 0:17:24.500000::it's, you know, it is psychedelic, it's rock,
0:17:24.500000 - 0:17:26.060000::but at the end of the day, it's pop.
0:17:26.060000 - 0:17:27.740000::He's making pop music.
0:17:27.740000 - 0:17:32.740000::But he's making pop music that is like on the same level
0:17:32.940000 - 0:17:37.940000::as, you know, Prince or the mainstream pop.
0:17:37.940000 - 0:17:40.860000::That's a, it's like, you can't not love this.
0:17:40.860000 - 0:17:41.860000::You can't put this in.
0:17:41.860000 - 0:17:43.860000::Why is pop music so sick?
0:17:43.860000 - 0:17:46.380000::Pop music is by the way.
0:17:46.380000 - 0:17:47.420000::And country.
0:17:47.420000 - 0:17:49.500000::No, no, and in all countries,
0:17:49.500000 - 0:17:52.580000::oh yeah, you tap into the pop music in Mexico,
0:17:52.580000 - 0:17:55.340000::tap into the pop music in France in Japan.
0:17:55.340000 - 0:17:57.140000::It's always popping.
0:17:57.140000 - 0:17:58.780000::Pop is pop is pop.
0:17:58.780000 - 0:18:00.220000::It's popping.
0:18:00.220000 - 0:18:01.300000::I'm a pop musician.
0:18:01.300000 - 0:18:04.340000::Like we haven't had someone come out recently and be like,
0:18:04.340000 - 0:18:06.060000::there's a lot of people coming out saying like,
0:18:06.060000 - 0:18:07.220000::yeah, I'm a rocker.
0:18:07.220000 - 0:18:09.540000::Yeah, I'm a classic country singer.
0:18:09.540000 - 0:18:11.540000::No one's come out and own the pop label.
0:18:11.540000 - 0:18:13.660000::Yeah, I'm a pop star, bitch.
0:18:13.660000 - 0:18:15.380000::Take me or leave me.
0:18:15.380000 - 0:18:16.380000::Right.
0:18:16.380000 - 0:18:17.220000::Right.
0:18:17.220000 - 0:18:18.060000::Yeah, I kind of did.
0:18:18.060000 - 0:18:20.140000::My heart on my sleeve.
0:18:20.140000 - 0:18:22.340000::Didn't Drake have that pop star song?
0:18:22.340000 - 0:18:26.020000::Bitches calling my phone like I'm doing it ironically, almost.
0:18:26.020000 - 0:18:27.540000::Oh, he's afraid he can't trust you.
0:18:27.540000 - 0:18:28.540000::He is.
0:18:28.540000 - 0:18:30.540000::Right, because then what's his name came out,
0:18:30.540000 - 0:18:32.820000::member, just see this interview recently,
0:18:32.820000 - 0:18:34.900000::where they said, is Drake a rapper?
0:18:34.900000 - 0:18:36.860000::Does Drake do rap?
0:18:36.860000 - 0:18:40.220000::And he says, he goes like this.
0:18:40.220000 - 0:18:41.900000::Anthony Fantano?
0:18:41.900000 - 0:18:43.860000::No.
0:18:43.860000 - 0:18:47.580000::He makes, he says, he makes shopping music.
0:18:47.580000 - 0:18:48.580000::Oh.
0:18:48.580000 - 0:18:50.580000::I thought.
0:18:50.580000 - 0:18:52.900000::So what I like to shop.
0:18:52.900000 - 0:18:55.100000::By the way, you're always shopping.
0:18:55.100000 - 0:18:58.100000::If it's not monetarily, then it's just with your interest.
0:18:58.100000 - 0:19:01.180000::I'm shopping around right now with what I want to look at in my room.
0:19:01.180000 - 0:19:04.060000::Now I'm shopping around for what I'm sentenced and going to say next.
0:19:04.060000 - 0:19:07.060000::Oh, I want to talk about the jelly peanut butter and jelly sandwich I didn't buy today
0:19:07.060000 - 0:19:08.060000::at the gym.
0:19:08.060000 - 0:19:09.060000::They had a peanut butter.
0:19:09.060000 - 0:19:11.060000::That is in jelly sandwich at the gym.
0:19:11.060000 - 0:19:12.220000::That's all they had.
0:19:12.220000 - 0:19:15.660000::They had a couple stacks of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches in the fridge.
0:19:15.660000 - 0:19:16.860000::God damn.
0:19:16.860000 - 0:19:17.860000::How weird.
0:19:17.860000 - 0:19:19.420000::I watched this movie last night.
0:19:19.420000 - 0:19:20.420000::Okay.
0:19:20.420000 - 0:19:24.420000::The killers with Ava Gardner and a bunch of other people that are long dead.
0:19:24.420000 - 0:19:25.420000::Don't remember their names.
0:19:25.420000 - 0:19:26.420000::Oh, what's a Lancaster?
0:19:26.420000 - 0:19:27.420000::Berlancaster.
0:19:27.420000 - 0:19:28.420000::Berlancaster.
0:19:28.420000 - 0:19:31.020000::And one of the characters, they sit down at a restaurant.
0:19:31.020000 - 0:19:33.060000::She orders a hot milk.
0:19:33.060000 - 0:19:35.500000::This is what they were munching on in the 50s.
0:19:35.500000 - 0:19:37.260000::She orders a hot milk.
0:19:37.260000 - 0:19:41.300000::The guy says, I'll take a beer and a steak sandwich.
0:19:41.300000 - 0:19:42.300000::Rare.
0:19:42.300000 - 0:19:43.300000::Oh.
0:19:43.300000 - 0:19:44.300000::Rare.
0:19:44.300000 - 0:19:46.740000::Can you imagine eating like that?
0:19:46.740000 - 0:19:50.580000::Milk, beer and a rare steak sandwich.
0:19:50.580000 - 0:19:53.780000::That reminds me of what you kind of have a little bit sometimes there when you come
0:19:53.780000 - 0:19:58.380000::on and say, I just made roast beef and potatoes for breakfast.
0:19:58.380000 - 0:19:59.900000::You need to take my food.

0:20:00 - 0:20:04::creations out of your mouth before they poison you.
0:20:04 - 0:20:06.280000::You need to take your food creations out of your mouth
0:20:06.280000 - 0:20:07.280000::for their poison.
0:20:07.280000 - 0:20:08.780000::You do, you don't say.
0:20:08.780000 - 0:20:11.120000::Damn.
0:20:11.120000 - 0:20:13.080000::Say less.
0:20:13.080000 - 0:20:13.920000::Cabbage.
0:20:13.920000 - 0:20:15.040000::Yeah, cabbage.
0:20:15.040000 - 0:20:16.800000::They used to eat so differently.
0:20:16.800000 - 0:20:19.160000::It's crazy how fast that changes, though,
0:20:19.160000 - 0:20:23.840000::because look even to our own very own childhoods.
0:20:23.840000 - 0:20:25.520000::Raise your hand right now if you're listening.
0:20:25.520000 - 0:20:28.480000::Did you drink milk growing up a lot?
0:20:28.480000 - 0:20:30.640000::I had a neighbor who'd drink it on over ice.
0:20:30.640000 - 0:20:32.600000::Tall ass, full glass.
0:20:32.600000 - 0:20:33.440000::Oh, milk.
0:20:33.440000 - 0:20:36::I would put ice cubes up in that fucking shit.
0:20:36 - 0:20:36.840000::Hell yeah.
0:20:36.840000 - 0:20:39.320000::Are you putting strawberry, flavoring in there?
0:20:39.320000 - 0:20:41.080000::Hell no.
0:20:41.080000 - 0:20:41.720000::No way.
0:20:41.720000 - 0:20:43.120000::Did I have a glass of milk?
0:20:43.120000 - 0:20:44.120000::I have.
0:20:44.120000 - 0:20:44.880000::Siam.
0:20:44.880000 - 0:20:46.480000::Raw.
0:20:46.480000 - 0:20:47.120000::I love scum.
0:20:47.120000 - 0:20:48.120000::I would have all of you in there.
0:20:48.120000 - 0:20:49.120000::Siam.
0:20:49.120000 - 0:20:50.120000::Siam.
0:20:50.120000 - 0:20:51.120000::What's the calorie difference?
0:20:51.120000 - 0:20:52.120000::Siam milk.
0:20:52.120000 - 0:20:53.520000::Give me that Siam milk.
0:20:53.520000 - 0:20:55.400000::S.K.I.M.
0:20:55.400000 - 0:20:57.040000::That's what I like to drink in my milk.
0:20:57.040000 - 0:20:58.040000::Tell me, skim.
0:20:58.040000 - 0:21:00.040000::That is the ring.
0:21:00.040000 - 0:21:02.040000::Don't start freestyle right now.
0:21:02.040000 - 0:21:04.040000::You know what is crazy?
0:21:04.040000 - 0:21:05.840000::The milk tapes?
0:21:05.840000 - 0:21:11.960000::I can smell my dead protein sugar that he made with way the kind of like crude way protein
0:21:11.960000 - 0:21:17.600000::of the 2000s and skim milk and not a good washing every time you know what I'm saying?
0:21:17.600000 - 0:21:18.600000::You know that smell?
0:21:18.600000 - 0:21:19.600000::Yeah.
0:21:19.600000 - 0:21:20.600000::Yep.
0:21:20.600000 - 0:21:25.400000::How come dishes don't smell so great all the time coming out of the dishwasher?
0:21:25.400000 - 0:21:26.400000::You need to change the filter.
0:21:26.400000 - 0:21:27.400000::Yeah.
0:21:27.400000 - 0:21:29.280000::Change the filter in your dishwasher.
0:21:29.280000 - 0:21:31.280000::But even growing up, it's the same smell.
0:21:31.280000 - 0:21:33.280000::Can you smell it?
0:21:33.280000 - 0:21:36.120000::Because you're just making the, yeah, I don't know.
0:21:36.120000 - 0:21:39.600000::Maybe I don't like water.
0:21:39.600000 - 0:21:40.600000::You see what I just did?
0:21:40.600000 - 0:21:41.600000::I didn't know the answer to something.
0:21:41.600000 - 0:21:42.600000::I didn't bullshit.
0:21:42.600000 - 0:21:43.600000::I just said, you know what?
0:21:43.600000 - 0:21:45.160000::I don't know.
0:21:45.160000 - 0:21:47.080000::That's what I do at restaurants all the time.
0:21:47.080000 - 0:21:48.080000::I ask, hello.
0:21:48.080000 - 0:21:50.440000::I'll just tell you right off the bat.
0:21:50.440000 - 0:21:52.960000::It's not going to be that easy deal with me, but it's going to be worth it if you treat
0:21:52.960000 - 0:21:55.080000::me right in the end on that tip.
0:21:55.080000 - 0:21:57.080000::Next question.
0:21:57.080000 - 0:21:58.640000::Do you have avocado?
0:21:58.640000 - 0:22:00.400000::Second question.
0:22:00.400000 - 0:22:03.320000::Can you fucking, like, is there dairy in the egg cream?
0:22:03.320000 - 0:22:04.560000::You know what I'm saying?
0:22:04.560000 - 0:22:09.400000::Now I see them stammer for one second or whatever and I say, stop.
0:22:09.400000 - 0:22:12.600000::I see you're about to fucking make something up.
0:22:12.600000 - 0:22:21::Walk back to the kitchen right now and ask them before you give me an allergic reaction.
0:22:21 - 0:22:22::See what I'm saying?
0:22:22 - 0:22:23::Yep.
0:22:23 - 0:22:27.440000::I'm just basically saying exactly what you just said, Eric, but I'm going on about something
0:22:27.440000 - 0:22:28.440000::different.
0:22:28.440000 - 0:22:29.440000::Yep.
0:22:29.440000 - 0:22:31.240000::It's okay.
0:22:31.240000 - 0:22:35.080000::I asked them what was for family tonight.
0:22:35.080000 - 0:22:37.320000::Let me get a dose of that.
0:22:37.320000 - 0:22:39.760000::You said what's for family?
0:22:39.760000 - 0:22:44.520000::What was for family tonight, brother?
0:22:44.520000 - 0:22:49.520000::Tell me you watch the bear without telling me you watch the bear.
0:22:49.520000 - 0:22:51.920000::You know what is my pet peeve?
0:22:52.920000 - 0:22:57.480000::We go to, we all know someone in our lives, probably who does this.
0:22:57.480000 - 0:23:02.960000::We can sink offline about who it might be, but going in, the server is slammed and then
0:23:02.960000 - 0:23:07.040000::trying to indeed yourself a little bit too much of the server and going like, what's your
0:23:07.040000 - 0:23:08.840000::favorite thing on the menu?
0:23:08.840000 - 0:23:11.080000::Or like, I'm having a quandary.
0:23:11.080000 - 0:23:15.040000::Can you tell me which to pick from from this, this, this, just order your food and move
0:23:15.040000 - 0:23:16.040000::along.

0:36:12.920000 - 0:36:14.040000::So I'll wake up.
0:36:14.040000 - 0:36:14.920000::I brush my teeth.

0:36:34.200000 - 0:36:35.560000::Well, that's what man.
0:36:35.560000 - 0:36:39.320000::They weren't listening to podcasts, but what they were listening to was something
0:36:39.320000 - 0:36:40.200000::very similar.
0:36:41.800000 - 0:36:43.120000::It's called the radio.
0:36:43.280000 - 0:36:46.760000::They were listening to plays and narratives and people.
0:36:47.400000 - 0:36:51.720000::They were listening to FDR presidents talk on their fireside chats,
0:36:51.720000 - 0:36:55.400000::getting, you know, getting culturally,
0:36:55.400000 - 0:36:57.320000::getting down to the culturally tapping.
0:36:57.320000 - 0:36:57.640000::Yeah.
0:36:57.640000 - 0:37:02.120000::So listen to the news, listen to the world, right?
0:37:02.120000 - 0:37:04.720000::Because then you're, that's the problem.
0:37:05.040000 - 0:37:08::And this is, we don't want to knock joy tactics listeners,
0:37:08 - 0:37:12.360000::but people are atomizing to the point where I don't know if we're able to get
0:37:12.360000 - 0:37:16.480000::along together anymore because if, oh, what do you like to do when you get
0:37:16.520000 - 0:37:17.200000::home from work?

0:37:24.240000 - 0:37:26.280000::And it's like, okay, well, there's infinite back walls.
0:37:26.440000 - 0:37:29.600000::Now how are we going to relate when we get back on the back street, back on
0:37:29.600000 - 0:37:30.120000::the street?
0:37:30.800000 - 0:37:31.120000::Yeah.

0:37:34.560000 - 0:37:38.720000::I'm just thinking about the 40s baddies.
0:37:39.080000 - 0:37:42.760000::Can you imagine seeing Rosie, the MFN Riveter?
0:37:43.760000 - 0:37:45.600000::Listen with your own eyes.
0:37:45.600000 - 0:37:50.880000::Can you imagine the, if I saw Rosie, the Riveter in my, with my two eyes,
0:37:51.120000 - 0:37:55.240000::tears would come first off, right to, to my face.

0:38:04.840000 - 0:38:07.560000::this world and for the women and for actually men as well.
0:38:09.160000 - 0:38:09.760000::Wow.

0:38:17.280000 - 0:38:21.400000::Well, I think I think to when James Gandalfini,
0:38:21.400000 - 0:38:27::remember him from sopranos, when he would give at the at Christmas parties or at parties,
0:38:27.920000 - 0:38:31::just like a mobster, he would give people envelopes.

0:39:02 - 0:39:04.240000::that he had like not showed up.

0:39:07.720000 - 0:39:09.240000::It was like $10,000.

0:50:07.600000 - 0:50:08.600000::I don't know.
0:50:08.600000 - 0:50:09.600000::I don't know.
0:50:09.600000 - 0:50:10.600000::I don't know.
0:50:10.600000 - 0:50:11.600000::I don't know.
0:50:11.600000 - 0:50:12.600000::I don't know.
0:50:12.600000 - 0:50:13.600000::I don't know.
0:50:13.600000 - 0:50:14.600000::I don't know.
0:50:14.600000 - 0:50:15.600000::I don't know.
0:50:15.600000 - 0:50:16.600000::I don't know.
0:50:16.600000 - 0:50:17.600000::I don't know.
0:50:17.600000 - 0:50:18.600000::I don't know.
0:50:18.600000 - 0:50:19.600000::I don't know.
0:50:19.600000 - 0:50:20.600000::I don't know.
0:50:20.600000 - 0:50:21.600000::I don't know.
0:50:21.600000 - 0:50:22.600000::I don't know.
0:50:22.600000 - 0:50:23.600000::I don't know.
0:50:23.600000 - 0:50:24.600000::I don't know.
0:50:24.600000 - 0:50:25.600000::I don't know.
0:50:25.600000 - 0:50:26.600000::I don't know.
0:50:26.600000 - 0:50:27.600000::I don't know.
0:50:27.600000 - 0:50:28.600000::I don't know.

0:50:00 - 0:50:03.280000::When you're with him, things sure didn't drag.
0:50:03.280000 - 0:50:05.680000::He dig up a rose bush to spite me.
0:50:05.680000 - 0:50:08.320000::And when I'd grab him, he'd bite me.
0:50:08.320000 - 0:50:11.100000::Pant a picture of a difficult dog.
0:50:11.100000 - 0:50:14.280000::He bit lots of folks from day to day.
0:50:14.280000 - 0:50:17.800000::The delivery boy was his favorite prey.
0:50:17.800000 - 0:50:20.080000::The gasman wouldn't read our meter.
0:50:20.080000 - 0:50:23.560000::He said, we own a real man eater.
0:50:23.560000 - 0:50:27.720000::He set the house on fire, but the story is long to tell.
0:50:28.200000 - 0:50:29.240000::Boom, boom, boom.
0:50:29.240000 - 0:50:31.200000::How do you love getting it?
0:50:31.200000 - 0:50:33.440000::Suffice to say he survived.
0:50:33.440000 - 0:50:35.880000::And the house survived as well.
0:50:35.880000 - 0:50:40.200000::On evening walks and Gloria took him, he was always
0:50:40.200000 - 0:50:41.720000::the first out the door.
0:50:41.720000 - 0:50:44.520000::The old one and I brought up the rear because our bones
0:50:44.520000 - 0:50:45.800000::were sore.
0:50:45.800000 - 0:50:48.400000::He charged up the street with mom hanging on.
0:50:48.400000 - 0:50:50.560000::What a beautiful pair they were.
0:50:50.560000 - 0:50:53.120000::And if it was still light and the tourists were out,
0:50:53.120000 - 0:50:55.160000::they created a bit of a stir.
0:50:55.160000 - 0:50:56.720000::We did, we're almost done here.
0:50:56.720000 - 0:50:58.200000::But every day, every once in a while,
0:50:58.200000 - 0:51:00.040000::he'd stop in his tracks with a frown on his face
0:51:00.040000 - 0:51:01.320000::and look around.
0:51:01.320000 - 0:51:03.920000::It was just to make sure the old one was there
0:51:03.920000 - 0:51:06.720000::to follow him where he was bound.
0:51:06.720000 - 0:51:09.320000::Were early betters at our house, I guess
0:51:09.320000 - 0:51:11.240000::I'm the first to retire.
0:51:11.240000 - 0:51:13.160000::And as I would leave the room, he'd
0:51:13.160000 - 0:51:16.240000::look at me from his place by the fire.
0:51:16.240000 - 0:51:19.800000::He knew where the tennis balls were upstairs.
0:51:19.800000 - 0:51:22::I'd give him one for a while.
0:51:22 - 0:51:24.520000::He'd push it under the bed with his nose,
0:51:24.520000 - 0:51:26.080000::and I'd push it out with his mind.
0:51:26.080000 - 0:51:28::Johnny Carson's like, all right, that's enough.
0:51:28 - 0:51:28.840000::That's enough.
0:51:28.840000 - 0:51:32.640000::Like, yeah, my dog was chill, but I tried to travel the lot
0:51:32.640000 - 0:51:35.960000::for work, so I didn't know my vet.
0:51:35.960000 - 0:51:38.800000::OK, I'm so deep in, I have to finish it.
0:51:38.800000 - 0:51:39.640000::Yeah, I go.
0:51:39.640000 - 0:51:42.040000::Before very long, he tied the ball,
0:51:42.040000 - 0:51:45.800000::and he'd be asleep in this corner in no time at all.
0:51:45.800000 - 0:51:49.320000::And there were nights when I'd feel him climb upon our bed
0:51:49.320000 - 0:51:52.440000::and lie between us, and I'd pad his head.
0:51:52.440000 - 0:51:53.520000::Head.
0:51:53.520000 - 0:51:56.160000::There were nights when I'd feel his stare,
0:51:56.160000 - 0:51:59.600000::and I'd wake up, and he'd be sitting there.
0:51:59.600000 - 0:52:03.040000::I'd reach out to stroke his hair, and sometimes I'd
0:52:03.040000 - 0:52:05.160000::feel him sigh.
0:52:05.160000 - 0:52:08::I think I know the reason why.
0:52:08 - 0:52:10.040000::He'd wake up at night, and he would have
0:52:10.040000 - 0:52:14.520000::this fear of the dark, of life, of lots of things.
0:52:14.520000 - 0:52:19.320000::And he'd be glad to have me near, and now he's dead.
0:52:19.320000 - 0:52:21.540000::And there are nights when I think I
0:52:21.540000 - 0:52:25.180000::feel him climb upon our bed and be between us,
0:52:25.180000 - 0:52:27.380000::and I'd pad his head.
0:52:27.380000 - 0:52:30.900000::There are nights when I think that I feel that stare,
0:52:30.900000 - 0:52:35.020000::and I'd reach out my hand to stroke his hair,
0:52:35.020000 - 0:52:37.340000::and he's not there.
0:52:37.340000 - 0:52:40.020000::Oh, how I wish that wasn't so.
0:52:40.020000 - 0:52:42.780000::I'll always love a dog name, but oh.
0:52:47.780000 - 0:52:49.780000::Legit, got my ass.
0:52:49.780000 - 0:52:51.780000::Got you.
0:52:51.780000 - 0:52:52.780000::Damn.
0:52:52.780000 - 0:52:53.780000::Got you.
0:52:53.780000 - 0:52:55.780000::That was amazing.
0:52:55.780000 - 0:52:58.780000::Joe Perra is about to be hearing that,
0:52:58.780000 - 0:53:00.780000::and then coming for your fucking head.
0:53:00.780000 - 0:53:04.780000::Hey, man, I heard you were doing my bit, dude.
0:53:04.780000 - 0:53:08.780000::Man, well, I don't know why I had to read the whole thing,
0:53:08.780000 - 0:53:11.780000::but that's a great clip to watch.
0:53:11.780000 - 0:53:13.780000::You can find it on YouTube as well.
0:53:13.780000 - 0:53:16.780000::You could skip through all that, if you'd like to.
0:53:16.780000 - 0:53:18.460000::Yeah, you could find it on YouTube as well.
0:53:18.460000 - 0:53:20.900000::You could skip through all that, if you want.
0:53:20.900000 - 0:53:25.700000::But, man, what a poem from Jimmy Stewart about his dog bow.
0:53:25.700000 - 0:53:26.780000::Minds me of a...
0:53:26.780000 - 0:53:28.060000::He's unbelievable.
0:53:28.060000 - 0:53:30.940000::Minds me of a poem that I've been working on.
0:53:30.940000 - 0:53:33.460000::What is it, man?
0:53:33.460000 - 0:53:35.820000::I wrote a poem about my girlfriend's cat
0:53:35.820000 - 0:53:37.820000::who I live with for when it dies.
0:53:37.820000 - 0:53:38.820000::What is it?
0:53:41.620000 - 0:53:45.020000::Dear cat, you beat this shit out of me left and right.
0:53:45.020000 - 0:53:47.500000::I tried to go to eat food that night.
0:53:47.500000 - 0:53:49.580000::You smack my ass in the fucking head.
0:53:49.580000 - 0:53:52.420000::You put your claws and you wish that I was dead.
0:53:52.420000 - 0:53:53.740000::You fucking got...
0:53:53.740000 - 0:53:54.740000::You fucking...
0:53:54.740000 - 0:53:56.860000::All the food you eat smells like shit.
0:53:56.860000 - 0:53:58.740000::And then also your shit...
0:53:58.740000 - 0:54:01.100000::Fucking smells like shit too, bitch.
0:54:01.100000 - 0:54:02.620000::And then...
0:54:02.620000 - 0:54:03.980000::You don't let me sleep.
0:54:03.980000 - 0:54:05.660000::You smack me on my head.
0:54:05.660000 - 0:54:09.380000::But it's okay, because now you're dead.
0:54:09.380000 - 0:54:10.860000::Damn!
0:54:10.860000 - 0:54:11.700000::Ha, ha, ha, ha.
0:54:11.700000 - 0:54:12.700000::It's not done.
0:54:12.700000 - 0:54:13.700000::Ha, ha, ha.
0:54:13.700000 - 0:54:15.660000::I outlive the cat.
0:54:15.660000 - 0:54:16.660000::Look at me.
0:54:16.660000 - 0:54:19.660000::Big, awesome life, living on a boat ship.
0:54:19.660000 - 0:54:20.660000::Chicken mouth yet?
0:54:20.660000 - 0:54:21.660000::Yeah.
0:54:21.660000 - 0:54:25.300000::Yeah, I guess that is the end of it.
0:54:25.300000 - 0:54:26.300000::Oh, I'm sorry.
0:54:26.300000 - 0:54:29.540000::I do not eat green eggs in ham.
0:54:29.540000 - 0:54:30.540000::No, I don't know.
0:54:30.540000 - 0:54:32.540000::That was off the dome, Jay.
0:54:32.540000 - 0:54:34.620000::That was called honestly expressing myself.
0:54:34.620000 - 0:54:36.140000::That's called musical improv.
0:54:36.140000 - 0:54:37.140000::Pay it off.
0:54:37.140000 - 0:54:41.260000::Should we do a full musical improv episode coming out?
0:54:41.900000 - 0:54:43.540000::I think we...
0:54:43.540000 - 0:54:44.540000::I think we have to.
0:54:44.540000 - 0:54:46.340000::I think we need to release me doing the...
0:54:46.340000 - 0:54:49.260000::There's a video of me online doing musical improv
0:54:49.260000 - 0:54:52.580000::that needs for the $100 Patreon to people.
0:54:52.580000 - 0:54:53.940000::Oh, don't tell me the hackers, man.
0:54:53.940000 - 0:54:54.940000::They'll find it.
0:54:54.940000 - 0:54:56.260000::Ha, ha, ha.
0:54:56.260000 - 0:54:57.260000::Wow.
0:54:57.260000 - 0:54:59.460000::Eric Rahill on the Deltons, man.

0:55:00 - 0:55:02::Dan, you were there, Jack.
0:55:02 - 0:55:03::You were there, Jack.
0:55:03 - 0:55:04::I was.
0:55:04 - 0:55:06::Then singing.
0:55:08 - 0:55:09.500000::That is like the proudest, my mom.
0:55:09.500000 - 0:55:11.500000::Have you seen it, Nate?
0:55:11.500000 - 0:55:13::I have to.
0:55:13 - 0:55:14.500000::It doesn't come to mind.
0:55:14.500000 - 0:55:17::It would be like your favorite thing I think you've ever
0:55:17 - 0:55:19.700000::seen, like, you would ever.
0:55:19.700000 - 0:55:22::It's everybody coming out one at a time,
0:55:22 - 0:55:25::like doing a solo song character intro.
0:55:25 - 0:55:27::And Eric's just not coming out.
0:55:27 - 0:55:28::No nervous.
0:55:28 - 0:55:29::No nervous.
0:55:29 - 0:55:30::No nervous.
0:55:30 - 0:55:31::No nervous.
0:55:31 - 0:55:32::Like, thinking so hard on what to do.
0:55:32 - 0:55:33::And then, like, everybody's already out.
0:55:33 - 0:55:35::Eric has to go to the other, else, strange.
0:55:35 - 0:55:39::Oh, I had a, and the most, if there's video tape of this,
0:55:39 - 0:55:43::it would be like a million, like, fuck up videos.
0:55:43 - 0:55:47::There is video tape on cringe-read it, like, of it.
0:55:47 - 0:55:52::And it was like me doing, I had to do a musical improv scene
0:55:52 - 0:55:55::as Donald Trump in 2016.
0:55:55 - 0:55:56::No.
0:55:56 - 0:55:59::Like, I had to do an impression of Donald Trump, like,
0:55:59 - 0:56:03::and improvise a song as Donald Trump.
0:56:03 - 0:56:07::It was like, dude, I cannot tell you how hard I bombed
0:56:07 - 0:56:11::and how much I was like, wanted to escape my body.
0:56:11 - 0:56:13::Like, it was a little bit like that.
0:56:13 - 0:56:14::Like, hours.
0:56:14 - 0:56:17::I was like, oh.
0:56:17 - 0:56:21::Damn, I bombed recently at this thing at this really tiny,
0:56:21 - 0:56:24::in this really tiny room in Manhattan.
0:56:24 - 0:56:27::And there's, and I just went to the bathroom immediately,
0:56:27 - 0:56:29::after in the bathrooms right next to the stage.
0:56:29 - 0:56:32::So it looks like I went off stage and just hid in the bathroom.
0:56:32 - 0:56:35::Like, you mean, everybody could see me walk right in the bathroom.
0:56:35 - 0:56:37::That's pretty rough.
0:56:37 - 0:56:40::Well, you know what, Donald would do if he bombed.
0:56:40 - 0:56:41::What the hell?
0:56:41 - 0:56:44::He would stand right by the door, and he would look,
0:56:44 - 0:56:46::everybody in the face.
0:56:46 - 0:56:47::Wow.
0:56:47 - 0:56:50::Damn, he was a real one.
0:56:50 - 0:56:53::He was kind of a real one, wasn't he?
0:56:53 - 0:56:56::Yeah, he was a baddie.
0:56:56 - 0:56:58::Wow.
0:56:58 - 0:57:01::So we broke it down for you guys.
0:57:01 - 0:57:04::Who's the baddest of them all?
0:57:04 - 0:57:06::Cool, Ella.
0:57:06 - 0:57:07::What song?
0:57:07 - 0:57:09::What song is that right now that goes,
0:57:09 - 0:57:11::Who's the baddest of them all?
0:57:11 - 0:57:15::You, you want a dance, baby?
0:57:15 - 0:57:16::Yeah, I don't know, you want it.
0:57:16 - 0:57:17::Yeah, what is that song?
0:57:17 - 0:57:19::I don't know, it's a great song.
0:57:19 - 0:57:20::It's awesome.
0:57:20 - 0:57:22::It's given me life, even just hearing that little section of it.
0:57:22 - 0:57:30::Speaking of life, what gave everyone possibly gave everybody joy?
0:57:30 - 0:57:31::Hmm.
