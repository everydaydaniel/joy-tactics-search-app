0:00:00 - 0:00:02::You got that sharp tongue.
0:00:02 - 0:00:03::Yeah, yeah.
0:00:03 - 0:00:05::I got a weird ass tongue, man. It's crazy.
0:00:05 - 0:00:13::Welcome to Joy Tactics, the podcast dedicated to all things joyful, joyous, and meeting as many celebrities as humanly possible.
0:00:14 - 0:00:18::Hosted by Eric Rahill, Nate Veroni, and Jack Benzingham.
0:00:18 - 0:00:19::Enjoy.
0:00:21 - 0:00:26::To anyone out there who wants to be like Eric, trust me.
0:00:26 - 0:00:28::Trust me. You fucking don't.
0:00:28 - 0:00:36::I have medical shit that is so I hadn't even been discovered yet and the doctors don't even treat me because it's so bizarre.
0:00:36 - 0:00:41::It's under the skin. It's an all type of organ. I have organs that I don't ever see.
0:00:41 - 0:00:43::They're all turned around.
0:00:43 - 0:00:48::If you try little, you know a house that TV show Doctor House.
0:00:48 - 0:00:49::Of course.
0:00:49 - 0:00:57::They have their research team reach out to Eric to look at his biopsy or whatever autopsy to see all the things that are wrong with them.
0:00:57 - 0:01:03::That's what I was to look at all his medical history records.
0:01:03 - 0:01:13::And they were like, this is to this isn't capable of being described yet on television in one season or whatever.
0:01:13 - 0:01:17::They just can't guarantee that there's going to be six seasons to go through.
0:01:17 - 0:01:18::Jack just ran up all his stairs.
0:01:18 - 0:01:21::Yeah, I was like, why are you so.
0:01:21 - 0:01:23::No, no, no, no.
0:01:24 - 0:01:25::I'm not out of it.
0:01:25 - 0:01:28::I wasn't if Jack hadn't run up the stairs in the sky out of breath all of a sudden.
0:01:28 - 0:01:30::I would be driving your house, taking the hospital right away.
0:01:30 - 0:01:32::I don't go to the hospital.
0:01:32 - 0:01:34::No, I don't go to the hospital.
0:01:34 - 0:01:36::This is unrelated, but well, it is related.
0:01:36 - 0:01:39::But you know what my favorite style of acting is is like,
0:01:39 - 0:01:40::met a hurt.
0:01:40 - 0:01:42::No, no, lemon.
0:01:42 - 0:01:44::It is out of breath acting.
0:01:44 - 0:01:48::It is when you're like, can I just.
0:01:48 - 0:01:49::Sorry, I'm late.
0:01:49 - 0:01:50::Please.
0:01:50 - 0:01:52::I just got stuck.
0:01:52 - 0:01:55::It's the best trick in the book.
0:01:55 - 0:02:00::If you ever want to just have a compelling performance, just be out of breath the entire.
0:02:00 - 0:02:04::And by the way, I've had I've had to do that one time.
0:02:04 - 0:02:06::I'm supposed to be that I'm coming up.
0:02:06 - 0:02:08::They were like, oh, we'll get water to spray you down.
0:02:08 - 0:02:13::Make you look sweaty and you're supposed to have a run up a bunch of stairs and like reading a note on your front door.
0:02:13 - 0:02:17::I was like, I don't think you guys are going to have to spray me that much because I'm going to be sweaty.
0:02:17 - 0:02:20::Basically, I have to about three jumping jacks.
0:02:20 - 0:02:24::So before every take I was doing jumping jacks and it got my ass.
0:02:24 - 0:02:26::But guess what everybody?
0:02:26 - 0:02:28::Okay, we had a bad week last week.
0:02:28 - 0:02:29::He didn't go so good.
0:02:29 - 0:02:30::Bad things are happening.
0:02:30 - 0:02:33::And for some reason, I think that bad things will continue to happen.
0:02:33 - 0:02:36::This is our remember job from the Bible.
0:02:36 - 0:02:38::He's the man that God cursed.
0:02:38 - 0:02:39::Right.
0:02:39 - 0:02:40::Yeah.
0:02:40 - 0:02:42::He took away God took away his faith.
0:02:42 - 0:02:45::He tested Job's faith so intensely.
0:02:45 - 0:02:49::And for some reason, I feel like we're about to go through a book of Job type recipe.
0:02:49 - 0:02:51::It's not going to be good.
0:02:51 - 0:02:52::It's not the end.
0:02:52 - 0:02:54::It's going to continue to get worse.
0:02:54 - 0:03:03::I mean, I think it'll definitely continue to get worse, but we'll have so much ammo for our biopics and for our memoirs.
0:03:03 - 0:03:04::Right.
0:03:04 - 0:03:05::Everything that's coming down the road.
0:03:05 - 0:03:14::But while we're going through, while we're in the mud coming up here, we have to come up with strategies that will protect the very core of ourselves.
0:03:14 - 0:03:15::You know what I mean?
0:03:15 - 0:03:16::Eating right.
0:03:16 - 0:03:17::Exercise.
0:03:17 - 0:03:18::Right.
0:03:18 - 0:03:19::Drinking.
0:03:19 - 0:03:20::Whatever.
0:03:20 - 0:03:21::Smoke.
0:03:21 - 0:03:22::Take a clap.
0:03:22 - 0:03:23::Right.
0:03:23 - 0:03:24::On my courses.
0:03:24 - 0:03:25::Smoke.
0:03:25 - 0:03:26::Yeah.
0:03:26 - 0:03:27::I don't know.
0:03:27 - 0:03:28::You know what I'm saying?
0:03:28 - 0:03:32::We have to do the things that make us feel good.
0:03:32 - 0:03:33::So we don't lose ourselves.
0:03:33 - 0:03:34::Right.
0:03:34 - 0:03:35::We're toe to toe.
0:03:35 - 0:03:36::Like crazy.
0:03:36 - 0:03:38::You can't imagine how hard I worked out today.
0:03:38 - 0:03:39::Yeah.
0:03:39 - 0:03:40::I can't.
0:03:40 - 0:03:41::Literally can't.
0:03:41 - 0:03:49::And I think we are in a unique position because we are documenting this struggle in real time.
0:03:49 - 0:03:52::So our listeners are with us in this.
0:03:52 - 0:03:54::So they get to see week to week.
0:03:54 - 0:03:55::Are they still fucked up?
0:03:55 - 0:03:56::Are they alive?
0:03:56 - 0:03:57::Still hell?
0:03:57 - 0:03:58::Are they?
0:03:58 - 0:04:01::Are they now in an amazing place?
0:04:01 - 0:04:05::And that was that was actually a good thing that they went through this.
0:04:05 - 0:04:06::You know what I'm saying?
0:04:06 - 0:04:10::Like we are documenting this in real time for the history books.
0:04:10 - 0:04:11::You know?
0:04:11 - 0:04:12::Yeah.
0:04:12 - 0:04:15::And by the way, you don't have to worry about it.
0:04:15 - 0:04:19::If you're like us and you're in a bad spot, I know you are.
0:04:19 - 0:04:24::Know that human beings are excellence magnets, essentially.
0:04:24 - 0:04:31::And so what the way that works is things will get tear down and you're going to perceive that
0:04:31 - 0:04:37::as a bad thing in the moment because you are a sensitive, compassionate individual.
0:04:37 - 0:04:43::But you are clearing away for a new city like the line Saudi Arabia.
0:04:43 - 0:04:52::There's a reason that God made that whole place a desert so that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia could experiment with new cities and new geometric city shapes.
0:04:52 - 0:04:53::I got to be honest.
0:04:53 - 0:04:57::I went up two flights of stairs about six minutes ago at this point.
0:04:57 - 0:04:58::I'm still not.
0:04:58 - 0:04:59::You're still beyond it?

0:05:00 - 0:05:07::I just, well, I spoke for about 30 seconds there and by the end of it, I was feeling it.
0:05:07 - 0:05:12::That's a wake up call, man.
0:05:12 - 0:05:18::You need to be hitting the stairmaster, dude, and getting this right.
0:05:18 - 0:05:22::I can't hit this stairmaster in my gym because my head hits the ceiling.
0:05:22 - 0:05:24::Is that true?
0:05:24 - 0:05:26::Yeah.
0:05:26 - 0:05:29::That must be a low-ass ceiling or high-steer.
0:05:29 - 0:05:30::Pretty low.
0:05:30 - 0:05:36.360000::The gym I go to is pretty fucking like, it's designed to the inch where like, if you're
0:05:36.360000 - 0:05:42.760000::doing the this machine, somebody has to like, time walking by with when you're going in
0:05:42.760000 - 0:05:46.840000::because you can't walk, like everything is exactly perfectly positioned.
0:05:46.840000 - 0:05:50::Just kind of like how God made the continents.
0:05:50 - 0:05:55.840000::I used to hit the stairmaster in my fucking, and the way I would hit the stairmaster, my
0:05:55.840000 - 0:05:59.840000::ass was fucking like, like, popped out.
0:05:59.840000 - 0:06:01.840000::It was popped the fuck out.
0:06:01.840000 - 0:06:05.840000::I feel like people were filming the way that I was doing it on the stairmaster.
0:06:05.840000 - 0:06:11.840000::You have some crazy scoliosis and that's something you can do.
0:06:11.840000 - 0:06:16.840000::I was throwing ass out for the whole gym to just take a look.
0:06:16.840000 - 0:06:23.520000::I don't have ass too, so it was kind of like, and like, why is he so like, as if I had an
0:06:23.520000 - 0:06:28.680000::incredible like, thick fucking, dizzy ass that I was like, I was like, oh, check this
0:06:28.680000 - 0:06:29.680000::shit out.
0:06:29.680000 - 0:06:31.680000::Look at this thick ass dumper I got on the back.
0:06:31.680000 - 0:06:32.680000::Like, you guys want to see?
0:06:32.680000 - 0:06:35.280000::That's how I was doing it on the stairmaster.
0:06:35.280000 - 0:06:40.080000::Like I wanted people to like see what I was working with, but I don't have a fucking ass
0:06:40.080000 - 0:06:41.080000::at all.
0:06:41.080000 - 0:06:42.080000::It's just skin and a butthole.
0:06:42.080000 - 0:06:43.080000::That's it.
0:06:43.080000 - 0:06:44.080000::Whoop skin and a butthole.
0:06:44.080000 - 0:06:45.080000::That's there's no round.
0:06:45.080000 - 0:06:46.080000::Wait, wait, wait.
0:06:46.080000 - 0:06:48.880000::Why do they call asses all juicy?
0:06:48.880000 - 0:06:51.480000::Is it because it's like a fruit?
0:06:51.480000 - 0:06:52.480000::Good question.
0:06:52.480000 - 0:06:55.080000::Why do they call asses juicy?
0:06:55.080000 - 0:06:59.560000::Is it because it reminds people of some type of rich fruit that has water in it?
0:06:59.560000 - 0:07:01.560000::Like watermelon juicey.
0:07:01.560000 - 0:07:05.760000::Oh, yeah, that's one of the most sexual fruit.
0:07:05.760000 - 0:07:09.560000::Yeah, probably because of the shape because it's like round because if it's like round
0:07:09.560000 - 0:07:12.560000::turns a lot of fruit shape.
0:07:12.560000 - 0:07:18::I bet there was someone in ancient times that had a catastrophically big ass.
0:07:18 - 0:07:19::We spoke about it.
0:07:19 - 0:07:21.120000::We just went out.
0:07:21.120000 - 0:07:25.400000::Didn't we just speak about this about the ancient moody that kind of must be large?
0:07:25.400000 - 0:07:26.400000::Did we?
0:07:26.400000 - 0:07:27.400000::I don't know.
0:07:27.400000 - 0:07:28.400000::I don't know.
0:07:28.400000 - 0:07:30.200000::I feel like that's uncharted territory on Jotor.
0:07:30.200000 - 0:07:31.200000::Joy-Tack.
0:07:31.200000 - 0:07:33.840000::I don't think we've talked about the ancient moody.
0:07:33.840000 - 0:07:36.320000::Well, then we might as well discuss it.
0:07:36.320000 - 0:07:39::Maybe you had a permanent story.
0:07:39 - 0:07:41.760000::What do you think the biggest ass ever was?
0:07:41.760000 - 0:07:43.080000::Is it a megalodon?
0:07:43.080000 - 0:07:44.280000::Does a fish have an ass?
0:07:44.280000 - 0:07:46.720000::Oh, the megalodon ass.
0:07:46.720000 - 0:07:47.720000::The megalodon.
0:07:47.720000 - 0:07:49.640000::I always wondered this.
0:07:49.640000 - 0:07:53.760000::Do you think the different species of dinosaurs were getting it in with each other sexually?
0:07:53.760000 - 0:07:54.760000::Oh, my God.
0:07:54.760000 - 0:08:00.960000::I think I think I think like you know how I'll fucking lions and whatever.
0:08:00.960000 - 0:08:01.960000::What's a linic?
0:08:01.960000 - 0:08:02.960000::Links?
0:08:02.960000 - 0:08:03.960000::Links?
0:08:03.960000 - 0:08:04.960000::Links?
0:08:04.960000 - 0:08:05.960000::Whatever.
0:08:05.960000 - 0:08:06.960000::That's a computer program.
0:08:06.960000 - 0:08:07.960000::A linic?
0:08:07.960000 - 0:08:08.960000::A links?
0:08:08.960000 - 0:08:09.960000::What is it?
0:08:09.960000 - 0:08:10.960000::Yeah.
0:08:10.960000 - 0:08:11.960000::But what is that?
0:08:11.960000 - 0:08:12.960000::A links.
0:08:12.960000 - 0:08:13.960000::A links.
0:08:13.960000 - 0:08:14.960000::A links is its own thing, I think.
0:08:14.960000 - 0:08:17.200000::It's like a tiger and a lion, right?
0:08:17.200000 - 0:08:19.200000::Like they can fuck.
0:08:19.200000 - 0:08:20.200000::I didn't know that.
0:08:20.200000 - 0:08:21.200000::I don't know.
0:08:21.200000 - 0:08:22.200000::I am.
0:08:22.200000 - 0:08:23.200000::I'm actually am.
0:08:23.200000 - 0:08:26.520000::But I think all dinosaurs were like that.
0:08:26.520000 - 0:08:30.680000::Every single, no matter if they're tiny, big, I think they could all intertwine and
0:08:30.680000 - 0:08:31.680000::interbreed.
0:08:31.680000 - 0:08:36.280000::Well, have I spoken on ring species on this podcast yet?
0:08:36.280000 - 0:08:38.520000::No, I don't think so.
0:08:38.520000 - 0:08:40.920000::But everyone's been begging you to go in on.
0:08:40.920000 - 0:08:44::Well, I'm still working on my abstracts.
0:08:44 - 0:08:45.960000::So I don't want to reveal all of it at this point.
0:08:45.960000 - 0:08:53::But essentially a ring species is you have a species of animal.
0:08:53 - 0:08:56.920000::Let's say at the beginning of a geological barrier, let's say a mountain.
0:08:56.920000 - 0:09:02.400000::And then over the over the centuries and centuries in millennia, this species at the
0:09:02.400000 - 0:09:07.680000::bottom is traveling up one side of the mountain while the same species are traveling up the
0:09:07.680000 - 0:09:09.560000::other side of the mountain.
0:09:09.560000 - 0:09:17.600000::And over the centuries and millennia, eventually these species reconnect at the top of the mountain
0:09:17.600000 - 0:09:19.920000::and they can no longer breed.
0:09:19.920000 - 0:09:20.920000::Oh.
0:09:20.920000 - 0:09:27.800000::And what this is is an observable example of evolution called ring species.
0:09:27.800000 - 0:09:36.280000::And back in the days of the dinosaur, the earth's topography was such that many, this was
0:09:36.280000 - 0:09:40.080000::happening to so many species that they were all interlinked.
0:09:40.080000 - 0:09:43.760000::So you know, there were T-rexes that could fly.
0:09:43.760000 - 0:09:48.920000::There was like a bird with like dog-like behavior.
0:09:48.920000 - 0:09:53.200000::There was like a chicken with some shit on its head.
0:09:53.200000 - 0:09:59.960000::And I'm going to tell you what I made up 50% of what I just said.

0:10:00 - 0:10:01.520000::That's up to you to decide for.
0:10:03.220000 - 0:10:04.060000::Yeah.
0:10:04.060000 - 0:10:04.900000::Well, you know what?
0:10:04.900000 - 0:10:05.740000::That may be think of.
0:10:05.740000 - 0:10:09.460000::I think that Greek people are just kind of like,
0:10:09.460000 - 0:10:12.980000::they were at the cusp of being a different type of species.
0:10:12.980000 - 0:10:14.400000::You know, and I feel like they just.
0:10:14.400000 - 0:10:15.720000::What are you saying?
0:10:15.720000 - 0:10:20.720000::Yeah, Greek people were close to evolving.
0:10:20.720000 - 0:10:23.740000::If you say, if we built a wall around Greece,
0:10:23.740000 - 0:10:26.420000::they're like one or two generations away from that.
0:10:26.420000 - 0:10:29.500000::They're able to mate with like somebody from New Orleans.
0:10:29.500000 - 0:10:30.700000::Because they're so different.
0:10:30.700000 - 0:10:34.260000::They're so different than us regular humans.
0:10:34.260000 - 0:10:35.100000::You know what I'm saying?
0:10:35.100000 - 0:10:36.820000::You mean because they Greek people are.
0:10:36.820000 - 0:10:39.160000::They're just like, they feel like they're just,
0:10:39.160000 - 0:10:40.760000::they barely made the cusp.
0:10:40.760000 - 0:10:41.660000::You know what I'm saying?
0:10:41.660000 - 0:10:44.820000::Like they barely made it into the human species.
0:10:44.820000 - 0:10:46.380000::And you know, good for them.
0:10:46.380000 - 0:10:47.220000::Good for them.
0:10:47.220000 - 0:10:49.380000::They have the same DNA as us barely,
0:10:49.380000 - 0:10:51.540000::but like, you know, I'm just like, yeah.
0:10:51.540000 - 0:10:52.380000::I don't know.
0:10:52.380000 - 0:10:54.780000::I know I get a lot of hate for this on the podcast
0:10:54.780000 - 0:10:57.020000::for going in on Greek people.
0:10:57.020000 - 0:10:58.220000::And I don't want it to be like that.
0:10:58.220000 - 0:11:00.500000::I have a lot of love for the Greek people actually.
0:11:00.500000 - 0:11:03.500000::And I think they've known a lot for the human civilization.
0:11:03.500000 - 0:11:07.020000::But just overall, I just don't really care for them.
0:11:08.060000 - 0:11:08.900000::Right.
0:11:08.900000 - 0:11:11.420000::And do you, when you say that they can barely
0:11:12.620000 - 0:11:16.380000::mate with us, do you mean because they're going farther ahead?
0:11:16.380000 - 0:11:18.780000::Or because they're, no, oh God, no, though,
0:11:18.780000 - 0:11:20.820000::but way behind the evolution.
0:11:20.820000 - 0:11:21.660000::Okay.
0:11:21.660000 - 0:11:22.500000::Yeah.
0:11:22.500000 - 0:11:23.820000::Does that have advantages?
0:11:23.820000 - 0:11:26.660000::Like Neanderthal, like you're stronger.
0:11:26.660000 - 0:11:29.180000::Maybe, you know, maybe a little bit,
0:11:29.180000 - 0:11:31.380000::but I don't think anyone's kind of deciphered
0:11:31.380000 - 0:11:34.300000::what Greek people can offer too.
0:11:34.300000 - 0:11:37.540000::Let me just think in case there's any Greek people
0:11:37.540000 - 0:11:39.780000::that listen to the podcast and you're about to turn this
0:11:39.780000 - 0:11:44.780000::it off and go write up some horrible medium article about us.
0:11:45.420000 - 0:11:48.620000::I want to counter Nate's hate with love.
0:11:48.620000 - 0:11:50.460000::And I love Greek people.
0:11:50.460000 - 0:11:54.300000::I have never been degrees, but in all my dreams and fantasies,
0:11:54.300000 - 0:11:59.060000::I end up on the Isle of whatever, one of the Isles of Greece.
0:11:59.060000 - 0:12:03.340000::And I have a wide, beautiful wife and I've talked about this before,
0:12:03.340000 - 0:12:06.060000::but I'm eating fish all day and oil.
0:12:06.060000 - 0:12:10.500000::And I just think it's an amazing country with no faults,
0:12:10.500000 - 0:12:11.900000::with a rich, rich history.
0:12:11.900000 - 0:12:13.500000::And I appreciate every Greek person.
0:12:13.500000 - 0:12:14.740000::So, and I love them.
0:12:14.740000 - 0:12:19.740000::And I'm so attracted to all of you all intellectually and physically.
0:12:20.620000 - 0:12:21.620000::So God bless you.
0:12:21.620000 - 0:12:23.460000::And that's just interesting.
0:12:23.780000 - 0:12:26.340000::And I'll put myself right in the middle and say that I am somebody
0:12:26.340000 - 0:12:27.740000::you want on your side.
0:12:27.740000 - 0:12:31.780000::And I'm yet to be one over to hate or love Greek people.
0:12:31.780000 - 0:12:33.020000::So it's a huge.
0:12:33.020000 - 0:12:35.340000::This is a touchstone that we can kind of come back to.
0:12:35.340000 - 0:12:36.100000::You know what I'm saying?
0:12:36.100000 - 0:12:37.900000::We're kind of checking like Jack, where are you at?
0:12:37.900000 - 0:12:40.140000::Have I convinced you that, you know,
0:12:40.140000 - 0:12:44.460000::Greek people are less than, you know, subhuman basically.
0:12:44.460000 - 0:12:47.620000::And you're kind of towards Nate side.
0:12:47.620000 - 0:12:48.860000::I think a lot of people are.
0:12:48.860000 - 0:12:50.500000::There's just kind of a movement growing.
0:12:50.500000 - 0:12:55.180000::This is, this is just, I don't stand for any type of thing
0:12:55.180000 - 0:12:57.020000::unless it's against whatever.
0:12:57.020000 - 0:12:58.780000::Name one Greek person.
0:12:58.780000 - 0:13:00.580000::Yeah, name one as Greek person.
0:13:00.580000 - 0:13:02.820000::What you've just run because I love people so much
0:13:02.820000 - 0:13:04.460000::because they have an island.
0:13:04.460000 - 0:13:08.500000::I want to go kind of essentially steal from them
0:13:08.500000 - 0:13:11.340000::and have for me and my wife and darling.
0:13:11.340000 - 0:13:12.540000::Gary's Googling right now.
0:13:12.540000 - 0:13:13.540000::I'm not Googling.
0:13:13.540000 - 0:13:14.540000::I'm not Googling.
0:13:14.540000 - 0:13:15.540000::No.
0:13:15.540000 - 0:13:16.060000::I'm not Googling.
0:13:16.060000 - 0:13:17.340000::Did you just Google Greek people?
0:13:17.340000 - 0:13:18.580000::You Googled Greek person.
0:13:18.580000 - 0:13:19.580000::You're kind of find out.
0:13:19.580000 - 0:13:21.580000::I think a one Greek person.
0:13:21.580000 - 0:13:23.380000::You can't think of what nobody knows.
0:13:23.380000 - 0:13:26.100000::They're kind of, and don't even say Alexander the Great
0:13:26.100000 - 0:13:27.100000::because you're not Greek.
0:13:27.100000 - 0:13:28.260000::He's about, he's about to.
0:13:28.260000 - 0:13:30.580000::Don't say Harry Potter either because he's British.
0:13:30.580000 - 0:13:33.980000::Aries, Apollo, Hera, Hades, Zeus, Diaries.
0:13:33.980000 - 0:13:34.980000::They fake fake.
0:13:34.980000 - 0:13:36.580000::Those are Disney movie characters.
0:13:36.580000 - 0:13:38.300000::These are our gods.
0:13:38.300000 - 0:13:39.900000::And if you guys want to say them,
0:13:39.900000 - 0:13:41.620000::Greek gods aren't real.
0:13:41.620000 - 0:13:43.620000::Shut the podcast off right now.
0:13:43.620000 - 0:13:45.260000::I'm not playing anymore.
0:13:45.260000 - 0:13:48.660000::If you guys think this pantheon of gods is real,
0:13:48.660000 - 0:13:50.580000::they're the ones we better be scared of.
0:13:50.580000 - 0:13:53.540000::They're still real and they're in different spirits.
0:13:53.540000 - 0:13:55.500000::American gods style, if you read that book.
0:13:55.500000 - 0:13:59.740000::But yeah, I don't want to talk ill of anybody
0:13:59.740000 - 0:14:02.140000::unless that person is evil and whatever Nazi.
0:14:02.140000 - 0:14:03.740000::That's why people like you're,
0:14:03.740000 - 0:14:06.060000::because you, I mean, like there's just so much hate
0:14:06.060000 - 0:14:09.220000::around the world and you refuse.
0:14:09.220000 - 0:14:12.540000::Refuse, you put, I mean, I can't tell you how many times
0:14:12.540000 - 0:14:14.060000::that we've been in conversations.
0:14:14.060000 - 0:14:15.220000::Don't talk shit.
0:14:15.220000 - 0:14:19.460000::And there's just, there's so much ill will going on around you
0:14:19.460000 - 0:14:22.260000::in a discussion or whatever.
0:14:22.260000 - 0:14:24.140000::And you're just, I've seen you do this before.
0:14:24.140000 - 0:14:27.700000::You'll be like, hey guys, I'm just going to remove myself
0:14:27.700000 - 0:14:29.140000::and just kind of, yeah.
0:14:29.140000 - 0:14:31.740000::And you'll leave the function, the bar, whatever,
0:14:31.740000 - 0:14:33.780000::the dinner just in the middle and be like,
0:14:33.780000 - 0:14:35.780000::I'm not going to have this in my life right now
0:14:35.780000 - 0:14:40.860000::because if there's so much more to giving love
0:14:40.860000 - 0:14:42.140000::rather than hate.
0:14:42.140000 - 0:14:42.980000::Good.
0:14:43.940000 - 0:14:45.180000::If I hear people talking shit,
0:14:45.180000 - 0:14:49.100000::I put my AirPods in and I just wait until it's over
0:14:49.100000 - 0:14:52.380000::and I put on whatever smart list podcast
0:14:52.380000 - 0:14:56.180000::and I just tune it out because those guys don't talk shit either.
0:14:56.180000 - 0:14:59.660000::And yeah, I can't stand for that.

0:15:00 - 0:15:03.160000::Yeah, yeah, we won't we won't gossip about
0:15:04.240000 - 0:15:09.860000::We'll gossip about celebrities because that doesn't count right the second I would destroy a celebrity's life
0:15:10.200000 - 0:15:16.680000::Right because they've got it so good and they can handle whatever we throw at that and we deserve it more than them by long shot
0:15:17.080000 - 0:15:18.840000::but sure
0:15:18.840000 - 0:15:23.240000::If he's started talking shit about somebody like me and they started talking shit about somebody and we're up in pf
0:15:23.240000 - 0:15:29.720000::Changs or something Eric will bust out the laptop and put it on top of the whatever Singapore noodles
0:15:30 - 0:15:32.560000::and not talk to us for the rest of the night. Yeah
0:15:33.080000 - 0:15:36.560000::Which I you know, I appreciate but it also is kind of rude and in
0:15:37.920000 - 0:15:43.840000::Anti-social at the same time, but what I love there's tough love and there's rude love and strange love as well
0:15:44.480000 - 0:15:50.040000::Can you imagine back to the old days back right before right when there was competing
0:15:50.760000 - 0:15:54.640000::hominids, you know, I'm saying of course australopithecus
0:15:55.080000 - 0:15:58.560000::Yeah, yeah, they see each other and go what the hell
0:15:59.200000 - 0:16:03.920000::What because you know the Neanderthals and the human beings were hooking up?
0:16:03.920000 - 0:16:11.280000::Oh, there's Neanderthal DNA and probably all of us definitely in my ass the way I go crazy on the battle ropes at the gym
0:16:15.240000 - 0:16:18.560000::Well you get all the way you get all confused and angry when when
0:16:19.080000 - 0:16:23.120000::Something some restaurant or building has changed in your neighborhood big foreheads
0:16:23.120000 - 0:16:26.880000::Whatever does not mean they were confused and for you to say that is so species
0:16:27.240000 - 0:16:32.960000::I'm not saying about now. I'm saying it's not it's just scientific data man. I
0:16:34.200000 - 0:16:36.200000::Want to be at a party with all the old
0:16:37.160000 - 0:16:42.680000::Creatures that used to roam this earth. I want to be in a tub with I want to be in the world's biggest tub
0:16:43.720000 - 0:16:51.080000::Share the water and just share it and drink the water. Yeah, I want to be in a tub with all my friends and family and drink the water
0:16:51.840000 - 0:16:55.160000::I wonder if there's the ancient type of meat that was all sweet. Oh
0:16:55.800000 - 0:16:58.120000::Definitely, you know, I'm eating a whole meat in savory
0:16:58.560000 - 0:17:02::Well, I think there I think there was ancient sweet meat
0:17:02 - 0:17:05.640000::Well, when you get it fresh out of the body and it's still cooking in the plum blood
0:17:05.640000 - 0:17:11.840000::You know what I mean like blood is sweet blood is sweetens and now blood is I was tasting blood last night and loving it
0:17:12.680000 - 0:17:18.040000::What the hell what would you buy your lip vampire reveal? Nope. What'd you eat some steak?
0:17:18.400000 - 0:17:22.040000::Nope, I was drinking a Pacifico and I thought this tastes like blood
0:17:24.160000 - 0:17:27::And then I was thinking I could get used to this
0:17:27.520000 - 0:17:33.480000::So you and you guys are both more hungover than you can imagine today, right? And yet I'm the one that's not interesting
0:17:34.480000 - 0:17:39.280000::The first time finally for the first time now I see what you feel like every day
0:17:39.280000 - 0:17:41.280000::slick
0:17:41.280000 - 0:17:48.360000::Sleep feel awful. I don't when I have a hangover though. I don't complain. I'm so stoic about all the pain I endure
0:17:50.480000 - 0:17:54.640000::Yeah, I just left it was not what Jack is that in my grain? Yeah
0:17:55.240000 - 0:18:00.840000::Eric did go home we waited about an hour 45 minutes for a table at a restaurant and then as soon as we sat down Eric
0:18:00.840000 - 0:18:06.320000::Well home what a guy he sticks around for the tough part of the night and then relieves himself for the
0:18:06.720000 - 0:18:08.720000::The the what would you call that?
0:18:09.280000 - 0:18:17.560000::Boils but this boils up, but here's what I did I order to burrito. Yeah, okay, so then I was feeling pretty good
0:18:18.920000 - 0:18:21.240000::Yeah, order to burrito. I've done this move probably
0:18:22 - 0:18:26.520000::Literally a hundred times order to burrito for myself when I'm feeling down put on Star Trek
0:18:28.240000 - 0:18:33.440000::loser to some to some that's being a loser to some being that is the most
0:18:33.440000 - 0:18:37.860000::Being a loser to some being an Olympian is being a loser
0:18:38.120000 - 0:18:44.760000::Why because you probably got into it when you're a four you don't choose to be an Olympian somebody else set you on that path
0:18:45.080000 - 0:18:51.960000::So what really would be inspiring is if your parents are both Olympians and all of your lineage are and what do you do?
0:18:51.960000 - 0:18:56.720000::You fucking eat cookies that's whatever we're talking about you become a cookie eater
0:18:58.720000 - 0:19:00.920000::Cookie monster Nate eats cookies from the back
0:19:01.920000 - 0:19:06.360000::Yeah, you do eat the cookies all you get the chocolate chips out one by one with your tongue
0:19:07.480000 - 0:19:14.520000::Nate has a way of being sexual with things that you could never imagine being sexual you got that sharp tongue
0:19:14.840000 - 0:19:21.880000::Yeah, yeah, I got a weird ass tongue man. It's crazy. Can you imagine someone with a sharp ass hard tongue on the top
0:19:21.880000 - 0:19:23.880000::And it's all soft more soft than you can imagine the back
0:19:24.960000 - 0:19:28.600000::No, I couldn't that's crazy. That's the toughest stuff I think about
0:19:29.600000 - 0:19:32.760000::Sounds functional that sounds functional you might not need teeth
0:19:33.520000 - 0:19:38.560000::Imagine being a oh because no one can track that if you're a tongue assassin you got a needle it needle a little bit tongue
0:19:39.480000 - 0:19:41.480000::There's go up to a senator
0:19:41.640000 - 0:19:46.120000::Right in the neck what happened? Oh, I don't know there's no weapons
0:19:46.120000 - 0:19:51.680000::There's no weapons around this dude just came up and puncture this dude just came up and kissed him on the cheek and all the sudden as a hole is head
0:19:51.680000 - 0:19:59.120000::That's the most busted. I think that if we were all X-Men we would have the most busted mutations that are like

0:20:00 - 0:20:02::and god.
0:20:02 - 0:20:03::Yeah.
0:20:03 - 0:20:06.120000::Like, I have an eye that exploded.
0:20:06.120000 - 0:20:09.880000::Just I just, if I head up to them and one of my eyes
0:20:09.880000 - 0:20:11.960000::like them bust open in my face.
0:20:11.960000 - 0:20:14.680000::You only got two shots.
0:20:14.680000 - 0:20:15.600000::You only got two.
0:20:15.600000 - 0:20:17.880000::I only have two, two times I can use it.
0:20:17.880000 - 0:20:20.840000::And I have like, I'm like, but like one half of my face
0:20:20.840000 - 0:20:21.840000::is like exploded off.
0:20:21.840000 - 0:20:25.040000::So I have one left for the whole X-Men journey.
0:20:25.040000 - 0:20:27.640000::The second one goes off, because you get excited
0:20:27.640000 - 0:20:28.640000::that dead mouse concert.
0:20:28.640000 - 0:20:30.640000::You're like, I can't believe what you're hearing.
0:20:30.640000 - 0:20:32.360000::Kill everybody in the audience.
0:20:32.360000 - 0:20:33.600000::We got to get to one of those.
0:20:33.600000 - 0:20:34.480000::Oh, my god.
0:20:34.480000 - 0:20:35.280000::That's a style.
0:20:35.280000 - 0:20:36.640000::Well, that happens to whales.
0:20:36.640000 - 0:20:39.080000::You've seen the whale blow up.
0:20:39.080000 - 0:20:40.080000::A whale blow.
0:20:40.080000 - 0:20:43::Oh, have you guys seen that video of the whale blowing up?
0:20:43 - 0:20:43.840000::Of course.
0:20:43.840000 - 0:20:44.840000::The whale beached.
0:20:44.840000 - 0:20:46.840000::This is some of the funniest footage I've ever seen.
0:20:46.840000 - 0:20:48.160000::Hey, you haven't seen this?
0:20:48.160000 - 0:20:49.080000::How is that possible?
0:20:49.080000 - 0:20:50.920000::I can't believe this.
0:20:50.920000 - 0:20:51.760000::I hate the whale.
0:20:51.760000 - 0:20:53.560000::I washed up, beached.
0:20:53.560000 - 0:20:55.080000::You don't mean that, dude.
0:20:55.080000 - 0:20:56.200000::You're so hateful, dude.
0:20:56.200000 - 0:20:56.920000::All the inmates.
0:20:56.920000 - 0:20:57.920000::I don't know what it is, too.
0:20:57.920000 - 0:20:58.920000::What is this, man?
0:20:58.920000 - 0:21:02.920000::I need to readjust my attitude for this.
0:21:02.920000 - 0:21:04.960000::You need to heal something in your sleep.
0:21:04.960000 - 0:21:05.960000::I need to healing badly.
0:21:05.960000 - 0:21:06.960000::You need to get prayer.
0:21:06.960000 - 0:21:08.200000::You're asked to beat.
0:21:08.200000 - 0:21:10.720000::I need to get my ass fucking worked.
0:21:10.720000 - 0:21:11.560000::You do right now.
0:21:11.560000 - 0:21:14.600000::You need to get a seven-hour ass walk from the back.
0:21:14.600000 - 0:21:18.040000::If I asked you guys to beat my fucking ass, would you do it?
0:21:18.040000 - 0:21:19.040000::If I really did.
0:21:19.040000 - 0:21:22.680000::If you were going to pass away, if we did, yeah, I do.
0:21:22.680000 - 0:21:26.040000::If somebody came up to us, we were near in town next week, Nate.
0:21:26.040000 - 0:21:30.240000::If somebody came up to us with a gun and said, Eric and Jack, beat the shit out of your
0:21:30.240000 - 0:21:32.120000::friend right now, I'll kill him.
0:21:32.120000 - 0:21:33.920000::Or you'll kill me?
0:21:33.920000 - 0:21:34.920000::Oh, yeah, yeah.
0:21:34.920000 - 0:21:36.920000::You'd have to.
0:21:36.920000 - 0:21:37.920000::Yeah.
0:21:37.920000 - 0:21:38.920000::That'd be literally what.
0:21:38.920000 - 0:21:41.440000::But Nate, you got to wash this life.
0:21:41.440000 - 0:21:44.960000::Whale video, dude, because it's so...
0:21:44.960000 - 0:21:49.800000::They were recording it for the news as well, beached up on some beach in the 70s.
0:21:49.800000 - 0:21:52.440000::Their idea was to get rid of the whale because it was so heavy.
0:21:52.440000 - 0:21:57.040000::They were like, well, we'll just blow it up with like hundreds of pounds of dynamite.
0:21:57.040000 - 0:21:58.040000::I don't know how much.
0:21:58.040000 - 0:21:59.040000::We'll just destroy it.
0:21:59.040000 - 0:22:00.040000::Everybody get back.
0:22:00.040000 - 0:22:01.520000::Like, we're blowing the whale up.
0:22:01.520000 - 0:22:03.040000::It'll wash away.
0:22:03.040000 - 0:22:04.960000::I guess that's what they were thinking.
0:22:04.960000 - 0:22:11.680000::But they blow the whale up and the like, you know, 100, 200 pound chunks of blubber are
0:22:11.680000 - 0:22:12.680000::flying through that.
0:22:12.680000 - 0:22:13.680000::You see the explosion?
0:22:13.680000 - 0:22:14.680000::Oh, my.
0:22:14.680000 - 0:22:15.680000::And the blubber's coming down.
0:22:15.680000 - 0:22:16.680000::It's hurting people.
0:22:16.680000 - 0:22:17.680000::It's crushing cars.
0:22:17.680000 - 0:22:18.680000::Oh, my.
0:22:18.680000 - 0:22:22.400000::It's some sponge-bob type stuff.
0:22:22.400000 - 0:22:25.560000::Why didn't stuff happen like that anymore?
0:22:25.560000 - 0:22:30::Well, you got to pray that it doesn't, man, because when stuff like that happens, the
0:22:30 - 0:22:35.320000::government gets involved and action gets taken that causes repercussions for 20 years
0:22:35.320000 - 0:22:36.320000::plus.
0:22:36.320000 - 0:22:38.920000::If it's a dog, we're gonna blow up.
0:22:38.920000 - 0:22:41.440000::We're always gonna talk about addiction, isn't that?
0:22:41.440000 - 0:22:42.440000::Oh, yeah.
0:22:42.440000 - 0:22:43.440000::This episode's about addiction.
0:22:43.440000 - 0:22:44.440000::Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
0:22:44.440000 - 0:22:51.760000::So, being addicted, having addictive tori molecules, controlling your behavior, to the
0:22:51.760000 - 0:22:55.080000::point where you are not able to function, that's what addiction means, right?
0:22:55.080000 - 0:22:56.080000::Right.
0:22:56.080000 - 0:23:00.200000::There is some impulse that you have, which is interfering with your ability to fucking
0:23:00.200000 - 0:23:02.960000::get in line.
0:23:02.960000 - 0:23:04.200000::So is addiction good?
0:23:04.200000 - 0:23:06.320000::I feel like a thing.
0:23:06.320000 - 0:23:07.320000::Go for it, mate.
0:23:07.320000 - 0:23:12.080000::I was gonna say, I feel addicted to hatred right now.
0:23:12.080000 - 0:23:13.080000::This whole episode.
0:23:13.080000 - 0:23:14.080000::You know what I'm saying?
0:23:14.080000 - 0:23:15.080000::It's giving me that vibe.
0:23:15.080000 - 0:23:16.080000::And I don't like it.
0:23:16.080000 - 0:23:17.080000::I want to change.
0:23:17.080000 - 0:23:18.480000::But you know, I want to change, right?
0:23:18.480000 - 0:23:19.480000::You know that.
0:23:19.480000 - 0:23:20.480000::You can feel that, right?
0:23:20.480000 - 0:23:21.480000::Driven by the way.
0:23:21.480000 - 0:23:22.480000::I want to change, right?
0:23:22.480000 - 0:23:23.480000::The others.
0:23:23.480000 - 0:23:26.640000::You're on two strikes right now, right?
0:23:26.640000 - 0:23:28.600000::You got welds and great people.
0:23:28.600000 - 0:23:32.120000::And if you have one more strike, that's friendship over.
0:23:32.120000 - 0:23:33.120000::Yep.
0:23:33.120000 - 0:23:38.080000::If you say something about people with addiction problems, Nate, in a new way, I will not.
0:23:38.080000 - 0:23:39.080000::I would never.
0:23:39.080000 - 0:23:40.080000::Okay.
0:23:40.080000 - 0:23:41.080000::We'll see.
0:23:41.080000 - 0:23:43.560000::But addiction is real, but here's the thing.
0:23:43.560000 - 0:23:44.560000::It sucks.
0:23:44.560000 - 0:23:46.600000::It really is a disease for people that do have it.
0:23:47 - 0:23:51.280000::You can also become addicted to positive things.
0:23:51.280000 - 0:23:52.880000::People get addicted to running.
0:23:52.880000 - 0:23:56.400000::People get addicted to, because you get addicted to molecules, right?
0:23:56.400000 - 0:23:57.400000::Serotonin.
0:23:57.400000 - 0:23:58.400000::Dope of me.
0:23:58.400000 - 0:23:59.400000::Right.
0:23:59.400000 - 0:24:01.200000::That's what we're addicted to.
0:24:01.200000 - 0:24:03.600000::We're pleasure seeking creatures.
0:24:03.600000 - 0:24:09.440000::If you can redirect the pleasure from bad toxic sources like drugs and alcohol and cigarettes
0:24:09.440000 - 0:24:16.400000::and whatever video games even and redirect that into volunteering addictions.
0:24:16.400000 - 0:24:18.400000::I'm addicted to volunteering.
0:24:18.400000 - 0:24:19.800000::Yeah, you're not sleeping.
0:24:19.800000 - 0:24:21.800000::I can't fucking stop, dude.
0:24:21.800000 - 0:24:22.800000::I'm three a.m.
0:24:22.800000 - 0:24:25.800000::I got a fucking give me to the food bank, dude.
0:24:25.800000 - 0:24:26.800000::I got you.
0:24:26.800000 - 0:24:28.800000::You're like one of the girls.
0:24:28.800000 - 0:24:31.800000::You're like chill with a old person so bad.
0:24:31.800000 - 0:24:32.800000::Left it up.
0:24:32.800000 - 0:24:33.800000::Please.
0:24:33.800000 - 0:24:34.800000::I've left my life.
0:24:34.800000 - 0:24:35.800000::Please.
0:24:35.800000 - 0:24:38.200000::Wait, but, Jack, have you been volunteering still?
0:24:38.200000 - 0:24:40.680000::I've been volunteering like crazy.
0:24:40.680000 - 0:24:41.680000::Have you really?
0:24:41.680000 - 0:24:42.680000::Literally.
0:24:42.680000 - 0:24:45.800000::Probably two hours a month.
0:24:45.800000 - 0:24:47.600000::You're dropping off groceries.
0:24:47.600000 - 0:24:48.600000::No.
0:24:48.600000 - 0:24:49.600000::What are you doing?
0:24:49.600000 - 0:24:50.600000::Tutoring?
0:24:50.600000 - 0:24:51.600000::I'm tutoring.
0:24:51.600000 - 0:24:52.600000::Wow.
0:24:52.600000 - 0:24:53.600000::You're tutoring.
0:24:53.600000 - 0:24:55.920000::You don't see, I have to pull this out of you.
0:24:55.920000 - 0:24:57.600000::This was me, I'd be like every episode.
0:24:57.600000 - 0:24:58.600000::Guess what?
0:24:58.600000 - 0:24:59.600000::I just came from guys.
0:24:59.600000 - 0:25:00.600000::It lit.

0:25:00 - 0:25:02.140000::You can't imagine what I just spent my time.
0:25:02.140000 - 0:25:06.540000::Some things I do are between me and the Lord and Savior.
0:25:06.540000 - 0:25:08.040000::God.
0:25:08.040000 - 0:25:09.040000::I can't because.
0:25:09.040000 - 0:25:10.800000::It's incredible.
0:25:10.800000 - 0:25:12.840000::I just can't monetize everything, man.
0:25:12.840000 - 0:25:13.840000::I just can't.
0:25:13.840000 - 0:25:15.440000::Something sits wrong with me.
0:25:15.440000 - 0:25:18.440000::And I do have, I am collecting experiences
0:25:18.440000 - 0:25:20.640000::by when I do stuff like that that's
0:25:20.640000 - 0:25:24.760000::going to form a web series that I make shortly here after.
0:25:24.760000 - 0:25:25.520000::And that's ethical.
0:25:25.520000 - 0:25:28.520000::That's the thing.
0:25:28.520000 - 0:25:30.800000::Whatever it takes, volunteering.
0:25:30.800000 - 0:25:33.280000::If anybody has, this is legit.
0:25:33.280000 - 0:25:38.200000::Anybody has a volunteer recommendation in Los Angeles?
0:25:38.200000 - 0:25:39.480000::Nate, I do.
0:25:39.480000 - 0:25:40.480000::No.
0:25:40.480000 - 0:25:41.480000::I have one.
0:25:41.480000 - 0:25:42.320000::You have to do it.
0:25:42.320000 - 0:25:44.160000::And this is a recommendation, legit,
0:25:44.160000 - 0:25:46::for real, for everybody.
0:25:46 - 0:25:47.480000::They have chapters in a bunch of cities.
0:25:47.480000 - 0:25:51.120000::It's called Little Brothers, Friends of the Elderly.
0:25:51.120000 - 0:25:53.120000::I did this in Chicago.
0:25:53.120000 - 0:25:55.960000::And I think you guys both met my guy that I always
0:25:55.960000 - 0:25:56.960000::super-narred.
0:25:56.960000 - 0:25:58.240000::I have Bernard.
0:25:58.240000 - 0:26:00.320000::I got a fucked up video of him.
0:26:00.320000 - 0:26:01.520000::Oh my god.
0:26:01.520000 - 0:26:04.400000::From the beginning of the pandemic telling the joke.
0:26:04.400000 - 0:26:07.320000::Yeah, so I became, well, maybe I'll just
0:26:07.320000 - 0:26:08.800000::tell a couple of Bernard stories.
0:26:08.800000 - 0:26:12.240000::I go, I like sign up for this thing with my friend, Ben,
0:26:12.240000 - 0:26:13.720000::who just became a father by the way.
0:26:13.720000 - 0:26:15.160000::Everybody gave it for Ben Briggs.
0:26:15.160000 - 0:26:16.720000::Yeah, shout out to Ben.
0:26:16.720000 - 0:26:17.720000::Congrats.

0:26:19.200000 - 0:26:20.680000::And we both signed up for this program.
0:26:20.680000 - 0:26:24.840000::He got a guy that was so like, didn't want to talk to him.
0:26:24.840000 - 0:26:29.720000::Was pissed off that Ben come visit him and didn't speak.
0:26:29.720000 - 0:26:32.120000::And Ben had a very bad experience.
0:26:32.120000 - 0:26:33.920000::But I had this guy, Bernard.
0:26:33.920000 - 0:26:37::And the first time I met him, I go into his house.
0:26:37 - 0:26:41.040000::And as he has had a little rent control department,
0:26:41.040000 - 0:26:43.240000::he was living in.
0:26:43.240000 - 0:26:48.680000::And I go in and there's just carpet.
0:26:48.680000 - 0:26:51.240000::Like little pieces of carpet that he had found like scraps,
0:26:51.240000 - 0:26:52.800000::I think from a construction site or something
0:26:52.800000 - 0:26:54.680000::where they were doing an installation.
0:26:54.680000 - 0:26:59.480000::And it's carpets like piled halfway to the ceiling, painted pink,
0:26:59.480000 - 0:27:01.960000::like just painted with like house paint.
0:27:01.960000 - 0:27:03.640000::And he's like trying to fit.
0:27:03.640000 - 0:27:05.960000::He's like, how do you think I can start selling these to college
0:27:05.960000 - 0:27:08.840000::kids for their bathrooms?
0:27:08.840000 - 0:27:11.920000::And yeah, that's one story.
0:27:11.920000 - 0:27:14.720000::But he would come up with all type of inventions
0:27:14.720000 - 0:27:16.680000::and try to pitch me on them.
0:27:16.680000 - 0:27:18.880000::But he would also come up with jokes in one time.
0:27:18.880000 - 0:27:20.160000::It was like right in the pandemic.
0:27:20.160000 - 0:27:23.160000::And we were chill with my roommate with our roommate, Meg.
0:27:23.160000 - 0:27:24.840000::And I was like, let's call it Bernharden.
0:27:24.840000 - 0:27:26.280000::Have him tell joke because I would call him.
0:27:26.280000 - 0:27:28.280000::And he would just say some random jokes.
0:27:28.280000 - 0:27:31.200000::And he said on camera, maybe one of the most vile jokes
0:27:31.200000 - 0:27:34.480000::I've ever heard in my life.
0:27:34.480000 - 0:27:37.240000::So, so nasty.
0:27:37.240000 - 0:27:38.720000::Yep.
0:27:38.720000 - 0:27:43.840000::If I am ever an elderly person and I am a part of this program,
0:27:43.840000 - 0:27:48.840000::I am going to fucking harass the young person that volunteers.
0:27:48.840000 - 0:27:52.320000::And it's going to be like the reverse band, Marjara, where I'm like,
0:27:52.320000 - 0:27:53.640000::you're like pranking them all the time.
0:27:53.640000 - 0:27:56.600000::I'm drinking them, like beating the shit out of them on the toilet.
0:27:56.600000 - 0:28:02.120000::Like, pile driving them, like from, you're like,
0:28:02.120000 - 0:28:03.120000::perched above the door.
0:28:03.120000 - 0:28:05.840000::And old person pile driving, like some nine-year-old
0:28:05.840000 - 0:28:07.560000::doing a pile driver.
0:28:07.560000 - 0:28:10.760000::We need to get a new bad grandpa right now.
0:28:10.760000 - 0:28:12.480000::Good God.
0:28:12.480000 - 0:28:13.480000::I love that.
0:28:13.480000 - 0:28:14.480000::I love the idea.
0:28:14.480000 - 0:28:17.480000::We're getting all these heels.
0:28:17.480000 - 0:28:18.480000::Yeah.
0:28:18.480000 - 0:28:19.480000::Come on.
0:28:19.480000 - 0:28:26.320000::Nate, you should do kind of a knockoff ripoff of a bad grandpa, Nadia.
0:28:26.320000 - 0:28:27.840000::The Nadie 80-year-old.
0:28:27.840000 - 0:28:29.840000::Nadie older person.
0:28:29.840000 - 0:28:31.840000::Nadie wise man.
0:28:31.840000 - 0:28:32.840000::Oh my goodness.
0:28:32.840000 - 0:28:37.240000::We can just start ripping some of this stuff off.
0:28:37.240000 - 0:28:39.640000::And what's the world's about to be ended?
0:28:39.640000 - 0:28:40.640000::Right.
0:28:40.640000 - 0:28:43.640000::Let's just rip this IP off.
0:28:43.640000 - 0:28:44.640000::Yeah.
0:28:44.640000 - 0:28:48.240000::Nate, I almost stole one of your jokes on stage last week.
0:28:48.240000 - 0:28:49.240000::That's good.
0:28:49.240000 - 0:28:50.240000::Do it.
0:28:50.240000 - 0:28:51.240000::You have a question.
0:28:51.240000 - 0:28:52.240000::Yeah, absolutely.
0:28:52.240000 - 0:28:53.240000::Yeah, thanks, man.
0:28:53.240000 - 0:28:58.040000::But I shouted you out because NPCs came up somehow with a person in the crowd and I
0:28:58.040000 - 0:28:59.800000::said, oh my God.
0:28:59.800000 - 0:29:05::My friend Nate has such a funny bit about NPCs and then I moved on.
0:29:05 - 0:29:06.600000::You hooked it up.
0:29:06.600000 - 0:29:09.200000::We are so supportive of each other in crazy way.
0:29:09.200000 - 0:29:13.520000::Like if we really are, Eric did one of my bits one time.
0:29:13.520000 - 0:29:14.520000::I did.
0:29:14.520000 - 0:29:15.520000::Oh, I did.
0:29:15.520000 - 0:29:18.440000::I said I did it.
0:29:18.440000 - 0:29:20.440000::That was unaccident.
0:29:20.440000 - 0:29:21.440000::Yeah.
0:29:21.440000 - 0:29:22.440000::Total accident.
0:29:22.440000 - 0:29:25.560000::I would never betray either of you guys anyway.
0:29:25.560000 - 0:29:31.920000::If some of this, if Daily Show came out with some correspondent like, you know, Desk
0:29:31.920000 - 0:29:37.040000::piece or something, one of the correspondence came on and ripped off Verbatom.
0:29:37.040000 - 0:29:40.480000::One of your jokes.
0:29:40.480000 - 0:29:43.120000::Would you make a fuss about it online?
0:29:43.120000 - 0:29:44.120000::Fuck you Jordan.
0:29:44.120000 - 0:29:45.120000::Fucking clapper.
0:29:45.120000 - 0:29:47.160000::You fucking call us messy in my mind.
0:29:47.160000 - 0:29:48.160000::Oh, online?
0:29:48.160000 - 0:29:49.160000::Online?
0:29:49.160000 - 0:29:50.160000::Hell no.
0:29:50.160000 - 0:29:51.880000::I would go straight to the car dealership.
0:29:51.880000 - 0:29:53.880000::Purchase a Ford F-150.
0:29:53.880000 - 0:30:00::Get the biggest, most scariest rims I can fucking get and I would drive to his fucking house.

0:30:00 - 0:30:01.600000::or I would drive to his kid's school
0:30:01.600000 - 0:30:03.640000::or I would drive to his manager's house
0:30:03.640000 - 0:30:06.600000::or their kid's schools and then what would I do?
0:30:06.600000 - 0:30:10.720000::Do leave the children out of the way to your school.
0:30:10.720000 - 0:30:13.120000::I would steal them.
0:30:13.120000 - 0:30:14.200000::Because guess what?
0:30:14.200000 - 0:30:17.040000::The money makers right here in both of y'all's lives
0:30:17.040000 - 0:30:20::are these faces and you can't let these faces
0:30:20 - 0:30:21.160000::do anything bad.
0:30:21.160000 - 0:30:23.360000::You can't have your face or your reputation
0:30:23.360000 - 0:30:25.640000::associated with anything violent or bad.
0:30:25.640000 - 0:30:26.520000::So here's what you do.
0:30:26.520000 - 0:30:28::Someone steals your joke.
0:30:28 - 0:30:30.480000::Hey man, I actually like your delivery.
0:30:30.480000 - 0:30:32.240000::No problem, I'm happy for all your success
0:30:32.240000 - 0:30:33.800000::and so cool you're working regularly
0:30:33.800000 - 0:30:38.480000::on Comedy Central, one of the best networks that still exists.
0:30:38.480000 - 0:30:40.720000::You come out, you say I support everything.
0:30:40.720000 - 0:30:42.560000::You come out as a weak person.
0:30:42.560000 - 0:30:46.440000::But you hire, guess who's hungry for money?
0:30:46.440000 - 0:30:48.480000::It's college kids.
0:30:48.480000 - 0:30:49.760000::Right, they'll do anything.
0:30:49.760000 - 0:30:50.600000::They'll do anything.
0:30:50.600000 - 0:30:52.480000::I'm finding.
0:30:52.480000 - 0:30:53.440000::And here's what you do.
0:30:53.440000 - 0:30:56.880000::You hire them and give them whatever, 25,
0:30:57 - 0:30:58.800000::whatever thousand dollars.
0:30:58.800000 - 0:31:02.160000::Yeah, 25 beers or some high amount of money you say,
0:31:02.160000 - 0:31:04.960000::you guys want to go try to be violent.
0:31:06 - 0:31:07::You know what I mean?
0:31:07 - 0:31:08.920000::You guys don't mean don't hurt anybody,
0:31:08.920000 - 0:31:12.080000::but just act violently and start to do shadow boxing
0:31:12.080000 - 0:31:14.040000::in front of the air in front of the house.
0:31:14.040000 - 0:31:15.160000::That's still the joke.
0:31:15.160000 - 0:31:17.120000::Can I just say to college kids?
0:31:17.120000 - 0:31:18.920000::If there's any college kids,
0:31:18.920000 - 0:31:20.720000::listen into this right now.
0:31:20.720000 - 0:31:22.960000::Everyone around you is taking advantage of you
0:31:22.960000 - 0:31:24.040000::and you don't know it.
0:31:24.040000 - 0:31:25.320000::You might be waking up right now.
0:31:25.360000 - 0:31:27.680000::Oh, shit, that fucking person is taking it.
0:31:27.680000 - 0:31:29.720000::That older person has taken advantage of me.
0:31:29.720000 - 0:31:33.440000::Everyone in your life that is not another college age person
0:31:33.440000 - 0:31:36.960000::is taking advantage of your time,
0:31:36.960000 - 0:31:41.800000::your labor and your mind and your heart.
0:31:41.800000 - 0:31:43.120000::Okay, so just.
0:31:43.120000 - 0:31:44.600000::You are a laughing stock.
0:31:44.600000 - 0:31:46.440000::You everybody is laughing behind your back.
0:31:46.440000 - 0:31:49.320000::If you're in college, you have no swag.
0:31:49.320000 - 0:31:51.040000::You got no respect for anybody.
0:31:51.040000 - 0:31:52.920000::You might as well leave it in the nose.
0:31:52.920000 - 0:31:54.840000::So prove us wrong.
0:31:54.840000 - 0:31:57.480000::Yeah, it's like I'm trying to reverse the psychology
0:31:57.480000 - 0:31:59.480000::so intensely like you're losing.
0:32:00.960000 - 0:32:03.880000::Man, I wish someone told me that in college.
0:32:03.880000 - 0:32:06.520000::No, college kids are fucking so sick.
0:32:06.520000 - 0:32:07.360000::A lot of them.
0:32:07.360000 - 0:32:09.360000::No, I respect college kids so much.
0:32:09.360000 - 0:32:12.680000::And yeah, any of you guys with ballets,
0:32:12.680000 - 0:32:13.520000::can I say this?

0:32:17.120000 - 0:32:19.120000::You're no more.
0:32:19.120000 - 0:32:23::I don't even care if you are if you're listening to this
0:32:23 - 0:32:24.120000::and you have a ballet and like,
0:32:24.280000 - 0:32:25.520000::oh, shit, that's me.
0:32:25.520000 - 0:32:26.800000::Get it.
0:32:26.800000 - 0:32:27.640000::Take it done.
0:32:27.640000 - 0:32:30.040000::You stop it.
0:32:30.040000 - 0:32:31.080000::Stop it.
0:32:31.080000 - 0:32:32.400000::We're done with the ballets.
0:32:32.400000 - 0:32:33.240000::We're done.

0:32:34.920000 - 0:32:35.880000::We are done.
0:32:35.880000 - 0:32:40.080000::It's not because you realize you look like a fool, right?
0:32:40.080000 - 0:32:42.320000::Everywhere you go, you realize you think your friends
0:32:42.320000 - 0:32:43.320000::think you're cool.
0:32:43.320000 - 0:32:46.080000::Well, you realize most people in the world are not your friend.
0:32:46.080000 - 0:32:48.440000::And when you go to work and when you go to sell something
0:32:48.440000 - 0:32:51.240000::on Craigslist, when you go to measure something around town,
0:32:51.240000 - 0:32:53.400000::people are laughing at you, dude.
0:32:53.400000 - 0:32:54.240000::Right.
0:32:54.240000 - 0:32:57.520000::Yeah, maybe you look like a fucking weird cliff.
0:32:57.520000 - 0:32:59.160000::I mean, but imagine this, Matt,
0:32:59.160000 - 0:33:00.560000::you guys don't see me for a while.
0:33:00.560000 - 0:33:02.640000::I go ghost mode and grind and you don't see,
0:33:02.640000 - 0:33:04.880000::you just kind of, I disappear.
0:33:04.880000 - 0:33:08.160000::And I come back and you see me and I'm on a boat,
0:33:08.160000 - 0:33:09.240000::off Long Island.

0:33:26.800000 - 0:33:29.600000::and like a trucker has.
0:33:29.600000 - 0:33:30.640000::Belly bucks and ears.
0:33:30.640000 - 0:33:32.080000::And a mullet down.
0:33:32.080000 - 0:33:33.880000::Yeah, yeah, yeah, back in my neck.
0:33:33.880000 - 0:33:35.800000::Yeah, I'd rip it off.
0:33:35.800000 - 0:33:39::I take you by the mullet and I would.
0:33:39 - 0:33:40.880000::I'd rip that fucking bitch off.
0:33:40.880000 - 0:33:44.440000::If you got a mullet hair piece, like at like 38,
0:33:44.440000 - 0:33:46.920000::trying to get, become young again.
0:33:46.920000 - 0:33:49.960000::Just go in the back here here.
0:33:49.960000 - 0:33:51.720000::By the way, I think I was the first person
0:33:51.720000 - 0:33:54.120000::to ever have the ball ball ball ball ball.
0:33:54.120000 - 0:33:54.960000::The ball ball ball.
0:33:54.960000 - 0:33:57.640000::Dude, I swear to God, I had up to my,
0:33:57.640000 - 0:34:00.280000::I was the first person in America to have,
0:34:00.280000 - 0:34:03.280000::to reignite the ball ball movement.
0:34:03.280000 - 0:34:04.440000::It really was.
0:34:04.440000 - 0:34:05.840000::But it wasn't a regular mallet
0:34:05.840000 - 0:34:07.160000::because there was party in the front.
0:34:07.160000 - 0:34:10.360000::What it was it was a party in the back.
0:34:10.360000 - 0:34:11.880000::Business in the front party in the back.
0:34:11.880000 - 0:34:13.400000::There was no business.
0:34:13.400000 - 0:34:14.920000::It was a vacant lot in the front,
0:34:14.920000 - 0:34:16.520000::but there was a party in the back.
0:34:16.520000 - 0:34:17.520000::Right.
0:34:18.360000 - 0:34:19.360000::There's a party in the back.
0:34:19.360000 - 0:34:19.960000::Yeah.
0:34:19.960000 - 0:34:21.560000::Nobody ever did it like you.
0:34:21.560000 - 0:34:22.520000::I remember all our friends.
0:34:22.520000 - 0:34:23.200000::No one.
0:34:23.200000 - 0:34:24.760000::Then a couple, not all our friends.
0:34:24.760000 - 0:34:27.520000::A lot of people supported this style.
0:34:27.520000 - 0:34:30.040000::I did, but some of our friends were naysayers.
0:34:30.040000 - 0:34:31.280000::Went one in particular.
0:34:31.280000 - 0:34:31.960000::OK.
0:34:31.960000 - 0:34:33.680000::He said he's got to cut that off.
0:34:33.680000 - 0:34:34.680000::I said no.
0:34:34.680000 - 0:34:36.760000::This is what's powering him.
0:34:36.760000 - 0:34:38.600000::But you look so different.
0:34:38.600000 - 0:34:41.080000::You look so different now, Nate.
0:34:41.080000 - 0:34:43.680000::I feel like back then you look like a.
0:34:43.680000 - 0:34:45.440000::It will come back.
0:34:45.440000 - 0:34:46.120000::I love that.
0:34:46.120000 - 0:34:46.960000::I'm so much.
0:34:46.960000 - 0:34:49.040000::Every once in a while, you would have the number five
0:34:49.040000 - 0:34:50.640000::hanging off the side of your head.
0:34:50.640000 - 0:34:51.920000::Because your hair was curly.
0:34:51.920000 - 0:34:55.240000::And it would be curled in the perfect number five.
0:34:55.240000 - 0:34:56.600000::It was so beautiful, man.
0:34:56.600000 - 0:34:59.080000::You'd be walking around and some.
0:34:59.080000 - 0:35:00.840000::You looked like.

0:35:00 - 0:35:06::Like just someone who was born to be like a weird landlord, you know,
0:35:06 - 0:35:09.600000::like just the chain, the tank top.
0:35:11.080000 - 0:35:12.760000::Yeah, absolutely.
0:35:12.760000 - 0:35:16.160000::Like a landlord that just doesn't care about like the rent, you know what I'm saying?
0:35:16.160000 - 0:35:21.400000::That's just kind of busy doing other things, but it's kind of maybe a new sense to you
0:35:21.400000 - 0:35:22.600000::sometimes in other ways.
0:35:23.240000 - 0:35:28.800000::Like the landlord, like your parents, friends from the 70s or 80s that died young,
0:35:29.040000 - 0:35:32.240000::and they have pictures of them and you wonder like, wow, what were they like?
0:35:32.240000 - 0:35:36.480000::I never got to meet Alan Allen who died in 1982.
0:35:36.760000 - 0:35:38.880000::You looked like somebody like that.
0:35:38.880000 - 0:35:39.360000::You know what I mean?
0:35:39.360000 - 0:35:44.280000::That my kids will never get to meet because they died from some illness.
0:35:44.280000 - 0:35:48.280000::But in a cool way, like like what's his name?
0:35:49 - 0:35:55.440000::That amazing actor who was in Godfather, Al Pacino.
0:35:56.240000 - 0:35:57.240000::No, it's um,
0:35:58.800000 - 0:36:00.120000::Marlon Brando, of course.
0:36:00.320000 - 0:36:02.480000::No, no, no, John Corleone.
0:36:03.480000 - 0:36:04.520000::No, it's the brother.
0:36:04.680000 - 0:36:08.240000::John, John Kazali.
0:36:09.080000 - 0:36:09.680000::You know this guy?
0:36:10.480000 - 0:36:11.760000::No, Kazali.
0:36:11.960000 - 0:36:12.880000::Yeah, I saw them.
0:36:13.080000 - 0:36:14.040000::Oh, yes.
0:36:14.040000 - 0:36:18.200000::Yeah, he and he's one of these guys that died young, but he had so much swag.
0:36:19.200000 - 0:36:20.800000::Oh, this is kind of you, Nate.
0:36:21.040000 - 0:36:22.320000::I can't die young.
0:36:22.320000 - 0:36:22.840000::I can't.
0:36:22.840000 - 0:36:24.160000::Well, I guess I'm not young anymore.
0:36:24.160000 - 0:36:25.280000::So it doesn't if I die.
0:36:25.280000 - 0:36:25.960000::I'm just you're young.
0:36:25.960000 - 0:36:26.760000::We're young men.
0:36:27.160000 - 0:36:27.760000::Right.
0:36:27.760000 - 0:36:29.240000::Everybody I meet, keep saying this.
0:36:29.240000 - 0:36:30.040000::You're a young man.
0:36:30.040000 - 0:36:32.040000::Dude, you got plenty of road ahead of you.
0:36:33 - 0:36:36.800000::I'm just I just the thing is I just started cooking, which is weird.
0:36:36.800000 - 0:36:38.080000::And I can't die now.
0:36:38.080000 - 0:36:39.240000::What kind of dishes?
0:36:39.880000 - 0:36:43.440000::No, no, no, I'm talking about cooking like metaphorically like creative.
0:36:43.440000 - 0:36:44.440000::You know what I'm saying?
0:36:44.640000 - 0:36:47.200000::Yeah, I'm making the shittiest meals on the planet.
0:36:48.200000 - 0:36:50.360000::I'm making the worst fucking meals for dinner.
0:36:50.920000 - 0:36:51.360000::I can't.
0:36:51.360000 - 0:36:54.360000::It would be like a waste of if you died right now, Nate,
0:36:54.360000 - 0:36:58.760000::that would be such a monumental waste of resources because you just haven't contributed yet.
0:36:59.040000 - 0:37:00.040000::But you're about to start.
0:37:00.040000 - 0:37:07.280000::But I'm about to very heavily to the culture in ways that people are will be shocked
0:37:08.200000 - 0:37:09.880000::about just wait.
0:37:10.360000 - 0:37:15.720000::And you'll replay this moment and you'll say, yeah, yeah, no, go ahead.
0:37:15.720000 - 0:37:16.160000::Sorry.
0:37:16.760000 - 0:37:20.480000::I was just about to say you got something cooking for CNN, a new type of neighbor
0:37:20.480000 - 0:37:25.840000::own investigates where you get all they're taking a conservative turn and you're going,
0:37:25.840000 - 0:37:26.640000::you're taking them there.
0:37:27.280000 - 0:37:28.120000::Right, right.
0:37:28.880000 - 0:37:30.840000::God, I would love to work for CNN.

0:37:39.760000 - 0:37:40.400000::So bad.
0:37:40.400000 - 0:37:45.120000::And I want to get right up to the bullets and laugh at them and interview the people firing
0:37:45.120000 - 0:37:45.640000::them on.
0:37:46.040000 - 0:37:47.200000::What made you do this?

0:37:48 - 0:37:50.280000::And what's the need you're driving a rage?
0:37:50.520000 - 0:37:54.840000::Oh, you can't speak to people in Ukraine because the people who are out there do a
0:37:54.840000 - 0:37:55.760000::correspondency.
0:37:55.840000 - 0:37:59.240000::They're not living up to the full power that they have.
0:37:59.440000 - 0:38:02.960000::They don't realize that yes, you can report on what's happening, but you also have a chance
0:38:02.960000 - 0:38:04.880000::to influence.
0:38:05.200000 - 0:38:09.160000::May I say the locals and the political figures living there as well?
0:38:09.680000 - 0:38:11.720000::It really shouldn't just be somebody delivering news.
0:38:11.720000 - 0:38:15.560000::Like why not have a gun and like do you think with it?
0:38:16.400000 - 0:38:17.440000::Why not build a fort?
0:38:18.120000 - 0:38:24.440000::Why not invite some type of Ryan Reynolds type, Ryan Gossing type celebrity out to the
0:38:24.440000 - 0:38:25.200000::war zone?
0:38:26.080000 - 0:38:29.600000::And you put up posters on both side, both fronts, right?
0:38:30.120000 - 0:38:32::On the whatever side and the other side.
0:38:32 - 0:38:33.840000::I don't know which teams are fighting.
0:38:34.520000 - 0:38:38.040000::And you say crazy ass party happening in this basement.

0:39:04.480000 - 0:39:05.480000::It's oh shit.
0:39:05.520000 - 0:39:07.280000::It's the other side is here.
0:39:07.280000 - 0:39:07.720000::What the fuck?
0:39:07.720000 - 0:39:09.680000::We can't we got to go hurt them and kill them.
0:39:09.680000 - 0:39:11.080000::And I say, guess what?

0:39:24 - 0:39:26.800000::And even if they still want to fight, they're all hung over for many days
0:39:26.800000 - 0:39:28.120000::because I put some poison up in the.
0:39:29.280000 - 0:39:29.880000::And that stuff.
0:39:29.880000 - 0:39:31.160000::So there's no more violence.
0:39:32.160000 - 0:39:32.760000::Yeah.
0:39:32.760000 - 0:39:35.280000::I mean, it's like, it's really solutions.

0:39:38.320000 - 0:39:42.920000::And I feel like a lot of people would be, you know, more down to fight in wars too.
0:39:42.920000 - 0:39:48.320000::Like, well, if there was like some kind of intermittent parties that went down,

0:47:05.080000 - 0:47:06.080000::You'd be shocked, man.
0:47:06.080000 - 0:47:11.360000::What if, what if the real reason that cancer is happening is because people are harvesting
0:47:11.360000 - 0:47:15.080000::tumors and killing them because it's actually one of the most valuable orbs that the universe
0:47:15.080000 - 0:47:16.560000::has ever created?
0:47:16.560000 - 0:47:17.560000::Oh, yeah.
0:47:17.560000 - 0:47:22.360000::I'm talking about orbs, biological, yellow, celestial orbs.
0:47:22.360000 - 0:47:26.120000::That only humans grow because we are built in the image of God.
0:47:26.120000 - 0:47:32.760000::This sounds like a book that your cousin, your uncle who's about to die would tell you
0:47:32.760000 - 0:47:35.600000::who owns a bookshop somewhere in the suburbs.
0:47:35.600000 - 0:47:38.440000::And it's like, I had this fucking screen.
0:47:38.440000 - 0:47:40.440000::Should've been a million, not a million movie.
0:47:40.440000 - 0:47:41.440000::That is a million.
0:47:41.440000 - 0:47:47.840000::If aliens are here to, it's a human, it's a farm for, hey, to say about tumors.
0:47:47.840000 - 0:47:50.960000::Well, the different tumors are trying to get from us.
0:47:50.960000 - 0:47:51.960000::Because what?
0:47:51.960000 - 0:47:58.200000::Tumor because, because, yeah, I can't think of anything.
0:47:58.200000 - 0:48:01.200000::I was trying to think of how that word could mean gold.
0:48:01.200000 - 0:48:02.200000::I can't.
0:48:02.200000 - 0:48:03.200000::It just can't.
0:48:03.200000 - 0:48:13.920000::I gave you a saying, we need to be writing a new sort of sci-fi novel of some sort.
0:48:13.920000 - 0:48:15.640000::That's like 500 books long.
0:48:15.640000 - 0:48:16.640000::You're telling me.
0:48:16.640000 - 0:48:17.640000::You know what I'm saying?
0:48:17.640000 - 0:48:19.120000::500, how many books long?
0:48:19.120000 - 0:48:20.120000::Yeah, yeah.
0:48:20.120000 - 0:48:23.600000::It's like there's so many different books on this fucking universe.
0:48:23.600000 - 0:48:26.200000::We need to create a world that we need to do world building.
0:48:26.200000 - 0:48:27.200000::You know what I'm saying?
0:48:27.200000 - 0:48:28.200000::We need to do a world.
0:48:28.200000 - 0:48:29.200000::What?
0:48:29.200000 - 0:48:31.440000::You talk about it as if that's not something that we actively engage in.
0:48:31.440000 - 0:48:34.200000::But each of us are such world builders by nature.
0:48:34.200000 - 0:48:38.520000::If God or wherever built this gave us any gifts, it's world building.
0:48:38.520000 - 0:48:40.960000::You guys want to build a world right now?
0:48:40.960000 - 0:48:41.960000::Of course.
0:48:41.960000 - 0:48:42.960000::Alright, everybody close your eyes.

0:48:47.640000 - 0:48:48.640000::Alright.
0:48:49.640000 - 0:48:53::And it's got little white stuff in it like ice cream.
0:48:53 - 0:48:56.600000::When ice cream has white chocolate, it has got a little white stuff in it.
0:48:56.600000 - 0:48:58.880000::But then you dig into it.
0:48:58.880000 - 0:49:04.680000::And while it's hard on the surface, underneath the ground, there's intert.
0:49:04.680000 - 0:49:06.480000::It is a yellow light jelly.
0:49:06.480000 - 0:49:07.480000::Gummy bear.
0:49:07.480000 - 0:49:08.480000::Gummy bear.

0:49:15.480000 - 0:49:16.480000::It's a guy.
0:49:16.480000 - 0:49:17.800000::Maybe there's no gender here.
0:49:17.800000 - 0:49:20.400000::It's a creature made out of all liquorish.
0:49:20.400000 - 0:49:21.400000::Oh.

0:49:33.400000 - 0:49:38.600000::And there's a ladder made out of a party looking crouton ladder.
0:49:38.600000 - 0:49:39.600000::Croutons.
0:49:39.600000 - 0:49:41.600000::This is a sweet land, dude.

0:49:52.320000 - 0:49:53.320000::People think he's discussing because he's savory.
0:49:53.320000 - 0:49:57.600000::Could you imagine us the fucking pitching this to like a studio executive?
0:49:57.600000 - 0:49:58.600000::I mean, dude.

0:50:20.080000 - 0:50:22.360000::but you could have a little sweet toasty thing,
0:50:22.360000 - 0:50:24.080000::toasted cracker thing.
0:50:24.080000 - 0:50:25.560000::So why not put a little cinnamon

0:50:47.160000 - 0:50:49.160000::I could only have that half as much as I did.
0:50:49.160000 - 0:50:50::I did.
0:50:50 - 0:50:50.840000::Uh-oh.
0:50:50.840000 - 0:50:52.880000::And he always wears a cloak.
0:50:52.880000 - 0:50:54.560000::Okay, because he doesn't want to people to see

0:51:00.080000 - 0:51:01.840000::what's that back looks like sweetbread?
0:51:01.840000 - 0:51:03.400000::Back look like.
0:51:03.400000 - 0:51:04.600000::Well, guess what sweetbread is?
0:51:04.600000 - 0:51:07::This is an X rated world, by the way.
0:51:07 - 0:51:10.680000::Sweetbread is made out of all sorts of cow lamb,
0:51:10.680000 - 0:51:12.600000::whatever the face,
0:51:12.600000 - 0:51:15::all the little bits that don't go into the meat
0:51:15 - 0:51:17.560000::or the sausage it gets put into the sweetbread.
0:51:17.560000 - 0:51:19::And that's what sweetbread is.
0:51:19 - 0:51:20::It's disgusting.
0:51:20 - 0:51:21.600000::Is that what sweetbread is?
0:51:21.600000 - 0:51:22.600000::I think so.
0:51:23.680000 - 0:51:26.320000::And so he's all traumatized
0:51:26.320000 - 0:51:28.880000::because he's disgusting.
0:51:28.880000 - 0:51:31.440000::All right, so what we just did is we built a world.
0:51:32.480000 - 0:51:34.880000::That's how quickly we could come up with a movie.
0:51:34.880000 - 0:51:36.320000::I'm saying we lost our jobs,
0:51:36.320000 - 0:51:39.800000::we can just be pitching to the dream works.
0:51:39.800000 - 0:51:40.800000::You know what's up?
0:51:40.800000 - 0:51:41.640000::Can I talk?
0:51:41.640000 - 0:51:42.960000::Sorry to interrupt,
0:51:42.960000 - 0:51:43.800000::but I don't mean to talk,
0:51:43.800000 - 0:51:45.560000::and I don't mean to talk shit about the one person
0:51:45.560000 - 0:51:46.560000::you shouldn't talk shit about.
0:51:46.560000 - 0:51:48.520000::God, but may I just say,
0:51:48.520000 - 0:51:49.600000::on the first day,
0:51:49.600000 - 0:51:53.240000::God made light, that's it.
0:51:53.240000 - 0:51:54.760000::Literally in the first three minutes,
0:51:54.760000 - 0:51:57.640000::we just made chocolate river, sweetbread.
0:51:57.640000 - 0:51:58.640000::Right.
0:51:58.640000 - 0:52:01.040000::If you gave us seven days to cook up on a world,
0:52:01.040000 - 0:52:03.040000::we'd be creating so much,
0:52:03.040000 - 0:52:04.480000::we should be God.
0:52:04.480000 - 0:52:06.200000::We are God.
0:52:06.200000 - 0:52:07.040000::Everyone's God.
0:52:07.040000 - 0:52:08.640000::I think that's what we always fucking forget
0:52:08.640000 - 0:52:11.160000::when we go through times of trouble,
0:52:11.160000 - 0:52:14.280000::is that we are the universe experiencing itself.
0:52:14.280000 - 0:52:16.040000::The only reason we exist,
0:52:16.040000 - 0:52:17.800000::even if this is an AI simulation,
0:52:17.800000 - 0:52:18.880000::it's probably, you know,
0:52:18.880000 - 0:52:22.280000::we're a million simulations in from the real thing.
0:52:22.280000 - 0:52:23.120000::Yeah.
0:52:23.120000 - 0:52:25.240000::It's still the universe experiencing itself.
0:52:25.240000 - 0:52:27.040000::It wants to experience pain.
0:52:27.040000 - 0:52:28.720000::It wants to experience happiness.
0:52:28.720000 - 0:52:31.080000::It wants to experience heartbreak and loss
0:52:31.080000 - 0:52:32.440000::and all the things that come along
0:52:32.440000 - 0:52:34.080000::with just being alive.
0:52:34.080000 - 0:52:34.920000::You know what I mean?
0:52:34.920000 - 0:52:38.640000::And so we ask why it's because it wants to experience
0:52:38.640000 - 0:52:41.800000::the spectrum of all emotion, all feeling,
0:52:41.800000 - 0:52:43.640000::and that's the gift of being human beings.
0:52:43.640000 - 0:52:44.480000::Are you sure?
0:52:44.480000 - 0:52:45.320000::Are you sure?
0:52:45.320000 - 0:52:46.160000::Are you sure?
0:52:46.160000 - 0:52:47::Are you sure?
0:52:47 - 0:52:47.840000::I'm sure.
0:52:47.840000 - 0:52:48.680000::That's the answer.
0:52:48.680000 - 0:52:49.680000::What if the universe doesn't want to experience pain,
0:52:49.680000 - 0:52:51.800000::and it pieces out every time you fucking stub your toe,
0:52:51.800000 - 0:52:52.640000::the universe gets out?
0:52:52.680000 - 0:52:55.040000::Well, then the universe is a little baby,
0:52:55.040000 - 0:52:56.760000::because guess what?
0:52:56.760000 - 0:52:57.920000::I'm experiencing this shit,
0:52:57.920000 - 0:52:59.440000::and I'm not even complaining.
0:52:59.440000 - 0:53:02.440000::So, and I'm going through it worse than you can imagine.
0:53:02.440000 - 0:53:06.240000::So I don't know, but I think the universe is brilliant.
0:53:06.240000 - 0:53:08.360000::I respect the fuck out of the universe,
0:53:08.360000 - 0:53:10.640000::every single one, two, because there are millions.
0:53:10.640000 - 0:53:13.080000::Yeah, infinity and the universe is,
0:53:13.080000 - 0:53:14.320000::don't talk about infinity.
0:53:15.520000 - 0:53:17.880000::Let's, we'll talk about infinity next episode
0:53:17.880000 - 0:53:19.440000::when we get all smoked out on.
0:53:19.440000 - 0:53:20.240000::Was he,
0:53:20.240000 - 0:53:22.960000::we were gonna get so fucking high.
0:53:22.960000 - 0:53:24.280000::This Patreon episode,
0:53:24.280000 - 0:53:26.120000::we are getting done with it.
0:53:26.120000 - 0:53:27.280000::I'm joy.
0:53:27.280000 - 0:53:30::This man, that makes me so nervous to know that.
0:53:30 - 0:53:32.160000::I'm so scared to be high.
0:53:32.160000 - 0:53:34.120000::That is one of the scariest things in the world to me.
0:53:34.120000 - 0:53:35.640000::Like, literally, I probably won't be able to sleep.
0:53:35.640000 - 0:53:37.040000::I'll be so scared.
0:53:37.040000 - 0:53:38.840000::All right, well, we'll do it in the morning, man.
0:53:38.840000 - 0:53:42.080000::All right, I'll take a half a milligram.
0:53:42.080000 - 0:53:43.080000::No, no.
0:53:43.080000 - 0:53:44.520000::And a joint.
0:53:44.520000 - 0:53:46.440000::All right, so we say what gave us joy,
0:53:46.440000 - 0:53:47.960000::and then everybody go hit the gym and went,
0:53:47.960000 - 0:53:48.720000::and,
0:53:48.720000 - 0:53:50.200000::I already hit taxes.
0:53:50.240000 - 0:53:50.840000::Yeah, yeah.
0:53:50.840000 - 0:53:52.120000::To a day.
0:53:52.120000 - 0:53:53.400000::All right, I'll start it out.
0:53:53.400000 - 0:53:56.360000::What gave me joy is you can't see it.
0:53:56.360000 - 0:53:57.240000::Nobody can see this,
0:53:57.240000 - 0:53:59.680000::but I'm putting my cursor over something
0:53:59.680000 - 0:54:01.880000::behind me in a Zoom frame.
0:54:01.880000 - 0:54:03.520000::skateboard.
0:54:03.520000 - 0:54:04.960000::I got a new skateboard, y'all,
0:54:04.960000 - 0:54:07.480000::and I've been going around my neighborhood
0:54:07.480000 - 0:54:09::like a little golden retriever.
0:54:09 - 0:54:10.720000::Is that your skateboard helmet?
0:54:10.720000 - 0:54:12.080000::That's my bike helmet.
0:54:12.080000 - 0:54:13.560000::Oh.
0:54:13.560000 - 0:54:14.960000::I don't wear a helmet.
0:54:14.960000 - 0:54:16.440000::You don't wear a helmet when you skateboard.
0:54:16.440000 - 0:54:18.840000::No, it's not possible to get injured.
0:54:18.840000 - 0:54:19.840000::Interesting.
0:54:20.760000 - 0:54:23.920000::And I went to shout out to KC DC,
0:54:23.920000 - 0:54:26.560000::this gate shop in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
0:54:26.560000 - 0:54:27.800000::If you're going to buy something,
0:54:27.800000 - 0:54:30.080000::anything at all, go to them.
0:54:31.680000 - 0:54:32.680000::Nice.
0:54:34.280000 - 0:54:35.280000::Nice.
0:54:35.280000 - 0:54:37.200000::Nate, what gave you joy, dude?
0:54:37.200000 - 0:54:40.320000::What gave me joy this week was,
0:54:41.760000 - 0:54:42.840000::let's see here.
0:54:42.840000 - 0:54:45.560000::You know what, I was doing a little bit of gambling
0:54:45.560000 - 0:54:46.680000::last night just with,
0:54:46.680000 - 0:54:47.520000::whoo.
0:54:47.520000 - 0:54:48.360000::All right.
0:54:48.360000 - 0:54:49.200000::Just with some dye,
0:54:49.200000 - 0:54:51.200000::some throwing some things, playing a little game.
0:54:51.200000 - 0:54:52.280000::Did you win?
0:54:52.280000 - 0:54:55.280000::And I won and it felt so good.
0:54:55.280000 - 0:54:57.720000::But then I did lose after that,
0:54:57.720000 - 0:55:00.080000::but I'm not a gambler.

0:55:00 - 0:55:08.160000::But I feel like, I don't know, it made me like want to be a part of a group of old men smoking cigars playing
0:55:08.160000 - 0:55:10.080000::on the whole year once a week, you know?
0:55:10.080000 - 0:55:10.240000::Yeah.
0:55:10.240000 - 0:55:15.120000::And like, this is like the one time that you get to get out of the house and get away from the kids.
0:55:15.120000 - 0:55:19.680000::And you're just like gambling all night long just for a little tiny bits of money.
0:55:20.320000 - 0:55:21.680000::That sounds like a fun time.
0:55:21.680000 - 0:55:27.920000::And I was like, maybe this maybe I should incorporate a light sort of, you know, healthy addiction
0:55:28 - 0:55:30::with gambling into my lifestyle.
0:55:30 - 0:55:35.200000::Yeah, I think you should like, I have, I'm maybe more lucky than a lot of people.
0:55:35.200000 - 0:55:40.160000::And I feel like over time, I think I would net positive, even though all the times I've gambled
0:55:40.160000 - 0:55:46.560000::so far have been in the red and I've never won money in a casino ever. But I think that's the whole change.
0:55:46.560000 - 0:55:47.200000::Well, we could go back.
0:55:47.200000 - 0:55:48.640000::Yeah, let's go back to the next one.
0:55:48.640000 - 0:55:50.880000::I think I should need to keep going to keep trying.
0:55:50.880000 - 0:55:55.280000::Yeah, I think yeah, let's get you addicted because once you do, you'll feel so good.
0:55:55.280000 - 0:55:55.840000::It works out.
0:55:58 - 0:55:59.440000::Okay, what gave me joy?
0:55:59.440000 - 0:56:01.840000::You know, last night, it was pathetic.
0:56:01.840000 - 0:56:04.160000::I got a migraine while we're getting in and I have to leave.
0:56:04.720000 - 0:56:08.560000::But I thought the migraine was going to last all night because sometimes they do.
0:56:08.560000 - 0:56:09.840000::It's the worst pain you can imagine.
0:56:11.040000 - 0:56:11.680000::But guess what?
0:56:11.680000 - 0:56:13.280000::It went away after about 30 minutes.
0:56:14.800000 - 0:56:16.640000::Had a breeder on watch Star Trek and it was amazing.
0:56:17.360000 - 0:56:21.920000::So, what gave you joy was something bad that gave you...
0:56:21.920000 - 0:56:22.560000::Cut taking away.
0:56:25.440000 - 0:56:27.200000::Wow, perceptions, man.
0:56:27.200000 - 0:56:27.920000::Exactly.
0:56:28.640000 - 0:56:29.440000::Exactly.

0:57:18.880000 - 0:57:20.320000::At least people hooking up.
0:57:20.320000 - 0:57:21.360000::People will be hooking up.
0:57:21.360000 - 0:57:22.480000::Oh, right. That's already happened.
0:57:22.480000 - 0:57:24::That must be all already happening.
