0:00:00 - 0:00:03.600000::There's so many ways to be killed.
0:00:03.600000 - 0:00:05.840000::You could kill someone with a sock.
0:00:05.840000 - 0:00:08.600000::Yeah, with enough of it's wet enough.

0:00:39.320000 - 0:00:42.840000::But I will say this, Eric, this is going to shock you.
0:00:42.840000 - 0:00:43.680000::What?
0:00:43.680000 - 0:00:48.880000::One of the biggest hubs, so I'm going deep, deep diving
0:00:48.880000 - 0:00:50.720000::into the analytics of this podcast.
0:00:50.720000 - 0:00:53.680000::We're getting every sort of numbers,
0:00:53.680000 - 0:00:56.760000::and we can track any sort of listener of where they're
0:00:56.760000 - 0:00:58.240000::at in the United States.
0:00:58.280000 - 0:01:00.160000::We know every single thing about you.
0:01:00.160000 - 0:01:02.400000::Maybe better than you know your fucking self
0:01:02.400000 - 0:01:05.360000::through the magic with these technologies.
0:01:05.360000 - 0:01:10.160000::And one of our top listener areas in the United States
0:01:10.160000 - 0:01:14.160000::is none other than Seattle, Washington.
0:01:14.160000 - 0:01:16.480000::And I have to think, Eric, you're from Seattle
0:01:16.480000 - 0:01:18.360000::or whatever, a suburb of Seattle.
0:01:18.360000 - 0:01:19.960000::You would say that, right?
0:01:19.960000 - 0:01:21.040000::It's a suburb.
0:01:21.040000 - 0:01:22.560000::Yes.
0:01:22.560000 - 0:01:27.440000::So I just say this is off the bat making me so pissed
0:01:27.440000 - 0:01:30.440000::I missed the 10 year reunion that they just,
0:01:30.440000 - 0:01:32.840000::we missed it because of COVID and that now was the 12 year
0:01:32.840000 - 0:01:34.040000::or whatever.
0:01:34.040000 - 0:01:37.800000::I had gone, oh, I just want to,
0:01:37.800000 - 0:01:43.800000::ah, ah, ah, that's planned as I walk into the fucking room.
0:01:43.800000 - 0:01:45.880000::Yeah, you're like Max Kebel's big move
0:01:45.880000 - 0:01:48.920000::and his Max Kebel from Max Kebel's big move, but in his 30s.
0:01:48.920000 - 0:01:51.640000::Joe, do you know, I went to a school with a girl
0:01:51.640000 - 0:01:54.320000::that was in Max Kebel's big move?
0:01:54.320000 - 0:01:55.520000::No way.
0:01:55.560000 - 0:01:58.640000::And I had my mom talk to her mom about how I could get
0:01:58.640000 - 0:02:02.960000::into child acting because of it.
0:02:02.960000 - 0:02:04.800000::Well, you dodged the bullet, man.
0:02:04.800000 - 0:02:05.800000::Thank God.
0:02:05.800000 - 0:02:08.840000::Unless you were in a child actually.
0:02:08.840000 - 0:02:11::Well, you being a child actor, you know,
0:02:11 - 0:02:13.720000::part of that contract is you have to be an adult,
0:02:13.720000 - 0:02:18.400000::not necessarily a offender, but you have to be an adult.
0:02:18.400000 - 0:02:20.920000::It's a person who's not doing that well.
0:02:20.920000 - 0:02:24.920000::I've seen a lot of interviews with people who were in movies
0:02:24.920000 - 0:02:27.800000::when they were on the younger half of their life.
0:02:27.800000 - 0:02:30.880000::Let's say 12, 13, 14.
0:02:30.880000 - 0:02:33.120000::And when you see them in interviews when they're older,
0:02:33.120000 - 0:02:35.120000::the way that they speak is in such a way that it's like,
0:02:35.120000 - 0:02:36.800000::did you get hit by a car mentally or something?
0:02:36.800000 - 0:02:39.560000::Because there's some trauma in there deep down
0:02:39.560000 - 0:02:41.640000::and it just makes me ashamed.
0:02:41.640000 - 0:02:44.160000::It makes me feel like, are we a version of that?
0:02:44.160000 - 0:02:47::Are we seeing success too young right now?
0:02:47 - 0:02:50.440000::Should we have waited to start a podcast until we were 70, 80?
0:02:50.440000 - 0:02:51.280000::No, no.
0:02:51.280000 - 0:02:53.280000::And I want to say this about the child acting thing
0:02:53.280000 - 0:02:56.800000::because I feel like there's a couple rotten apples
0:02:56.800000 - 0:02:59.920000::in the child actor bucket that just spoiled the fun
0:02:59.920000 - 0:03:01.200000::for everybody else.
0:03:01.200000 - 0:03:05.640000::Most people that were child actors grew up to lead amazing lives.
0:03:06.680000 - 0:03:09.280000::They were enriched by their experiences on these TV shows.
0:03:09.280000 - 0:03:11.600000::Made more money than I knew what to do with.
0:03:11.600000 - 0:03:13.200000::It was a blessing from God.
0:03:13.200000 - 0:03:14.880000::So the minute that I hear people talking shit
0:03:14.880000 - 0:03:17.920000::on child actors, I'm like, get the fuck out of here right now.
0:03:17.920000 - 0:03:20.360000::I'm a child actor advocate in that.
0:03:20.360000 - 0:03:22.680000::I think more children should be actors.
0:03:22.680000 - 0:03:27.320000::We need to start a TV show that just stars all children
0:03:27.320000 - 0:03:31.640000::and it goes for like 25 seasons.
0:03:31.640000 - 0:03:36.200000::And we can show the world what it's like to just kind of change
0:03:36.200000 - 0:03:40.720000::the narrative on child actors and give them all the tools
0:03:40.720000 - 0:03:43.240000::that they need to succeed mentally.
0:03:43.240000 - 0:03:47.040000::And because we, what do we, I mean, we can't exist
0:03:47.040000 - 0:03:50.240000::in an industry that doesn't have children acting.
0:03:50.280000 - 0:03:53.520000::We need children to tell these stories so badly
0:03:53.520000 - 0:03:56.120000::because children have so much to say.
0:03:56.120000 - 0:03:58.440000::And they're so ripe with drama.
0:03:58.440000 - 0:04:02.040000::And we need to be, we need, we need them to have
0:04:02.040000 - 0:04:03.560000::their own reality shows.
0:04:03.560000 - 0:04:06.120000::I'm saying take the parents out of the equation
0:04:06.120000 - 0:04:08.560000::instead of a mom and a dad or a grandma
0:04:08.560000 - 0:04:10::or a step mom or whatever.
0:04:10 - 0:04:13.520000::Why don't we have a DP and assistant camera operator,
0:04:14.600000 - 0:04:15.600000::line producer.
0:04:15.600000 - 0:04:19.680000::These are the people who can help us help the kids,
0:04:19.680000 - 0:04:23.560000::help themselves discover who they are live on camera.
0:04:23.560000 - 0:04:26::What could be more valuable than that?
0:04:26 - 0:04:26.840000::Ah.
0:04:26.840000 - 0:04:28.760000::Well, you should watch a, I have a show for you then.
0:04:28.760000 - 0:04:30.760000::It's called Kid Nation.
0:04:30.760000 - 0:04:32.520000::And this shit came out in the 2000s
0:04:32.520000 - 0:04:35.280000::and I wanted to be honest, so fucking bad.
0:04:35.280000 - 0:04:37.800000::What's that about a radio or something?
0:04:37.800000 - 0:04:40.360000::Now this was a, create, almost like a social experiment
0:04:40.360000 - 0:04:42.960000::where they give kids this crazy ass ranch
0:04:42.960000 - 0:04:46.160000::and they let them govern themselves and it's only kids.
0:04:47.080000 - 0:04:48.160000::Oh, yeah.
0:04:48.160000 - 0:04:50.920000::And if they get sick, guess what?
0:04:50.920000 - 0:04:51.760000::It's only children.
0:04:51.760000 - 0:04:52.600000::They got to go to us.
0:04:52.600000 - 0:04:53.920000::Another children.
0:04:53.920000 - 0:04:54.760000::Child.
0:04:54.760000 - 0:04:57.960000::And these children have crazy methods of trying to heal
0:04:57.960000 - 0:04:59.840000::the sick and the wounded a lot of times.

0:05:00 - 0:05:06.340000::didn't work. But that's how you learn. I used to buy meatballs at a meatball
0:05:06.340000 - 0:05:12.360000::shop from a 12 year old in my neighborhood. Really? So that's not a child actor,
0:05:12.360000 - 0:05:16.360000::but that's a person who's a child who's working. Should we reverse the sort of the
0:05:16.360000 - 0:05:20.620000::laws against child labor? Because you know, in some instances, I feel like some
0:05:20.620000 - 0:05:25.480000::children could really learn a lot from working in a grocery store at the age of eight
0:05:25.480000 - 0:05:30.560000::or so. Yeah. Well, school is let me pay labor. I think it's not a revisit that law.
0:05:30.560000 - 0:05:35.820000::The child. Can I say yes? We do need to make revisions to these laws, but B, we
0:05:35.820000 - 0:05:43.860000::have to be careful about it. So we need like a child ambassador to basically speak
0:05:43.860000 - 0:05:50.340000::up for it because. Okay, so we need we need a children's. Okay, so you can't vote
0:05:50.340000 - 0:05:54.560000::in elections until you're 18. We need an election that you can't vote if you're
0:05:54.560000 - 0:06:00.560000::over 18. So the kids can have an ambassador represent Congress. But then guess what?
0:06:00.560000 - 0:06:05.600000::We're going to be seeing a lot more candy stores a lot more fucking. And then that's so bad.
0:06:05.600000 - 0:06:09.880000::That if that reflect if that reflects the population, then that's a lot of part of that. So
0:06:09.880000 - 0:06:13.640000::they may be you know, people are so used to they're not being candy stores or whatever.
0:06:13.640000 - 0:06:19.200000::Right. How much of a shame is it because adults have all the stores, right? And how
0:06:19.200000 - 0:06:23.800000::frickin boring is it walking around? And how often do you see a McDonald's play place or
0:06:23.800000 - 0:06:28.720000::a trampoline park and you're like, man, why is it only that 25 Hasidic children are allowed
0:06:28.720000 - 0:06:33.360000::to go jump around and I got a few weird if I show up highs. There should be a place
0:06:33.360000 - 0:06:37.320000::for people to do that. So well, and I guess it's so interesting to think about because
0:06:37.320000 - 0:06:41.640000::like if kids were running the way things go, there wouldn't be a store. There would be no
0:06:41.640000 - 0:06:47.680000::money. It would be like a candy library. And you get to go in. Oh, freaking suck on a
0:06:47.680000 - 0:06:51.480000::book. But you got to give back a little bit. You got to give up. You know what I mean?
0:06:52.160000 - 0:06:57::No, you got to give a little labor to get it. Oh, you're saying like a co operative
0:06:57 - 0:07:05.320000::children run a co-operate type of candy stuff. Let me ask you guys this. Now we as adults,
0:07:05.320000 - 0:07:14.480000::we have a violent tendencies. We start conflicts and arguments with each other. What makes
0:07:14.480000 - 0:07:21.600000::you think that the children won't start wars within themselves and with other nations
0:07:21.600000 - 0:07:28.080000::against other kid governments? I say let them what let them right because that if only
0:07:28.080000 - 0:07:32.800000::these people like George W. Bush and Brotherford, whatever he is, if all these people had gotten
0:07:32.800000 - 0:07:38.980000::that, learn that lesson as children, how better off we'd be now because these people never
0:07:38.980000 - 0:07:44.020000::grew up because their dads and whoever said, oh, it's not going to Harvard. How to do this?
0:07:45.140000 - 0:07:49.460000::If they had learned not to start wars as kids like we did, then when they get into offices of adults,
0:07:51.460000 - 0:07:55.620000::yeah, whatever something to be said about having a, you know, kids have a tough life, you know,
0:07:55.620000 - 0:08:01.780000::they kind of learn, they grow up fast. And we were talking about how like this, what's the gen alpha
0:08:01.780000 - 0:08:08.180000::might be? They're going to be one of the hardest generations of all time. Yeah.
0:08:08.980000 - 0:08:13.140000::Well, I want to remind you, I just read this amazing book and I couldn't put it down.
0:08:14.180000 - 0:08:18.580000::And I, whatever I do, I do my own book reports, by the way, just for my own eyes.
0:08:19.460000 - 0:08:23.780000::I really, what's the book report? Many pages long and I do book reports on all type of books
0:08:23.780000 - 0:08:28.580000::that I'm reading. And I just did my own book report on a book, amazing book called Lord of the
0:08:28.580000 - 0:08:33.780000::Flies. You know about this? I've heard of this. I'm a good, interesting. This is a popular book
0:08:33.860000 - 0:08:37.380000::called Lord of the Flies. Well, guess what? It's not about some type of bug.
0:08:38.660000 - 0:08:44.420000::It's a British book. Lord, it's about these, and they kind of reinvented this with the new
0:08:44.420000 - 0:08:49.460000::amazing show Yellowjack. It's by the way, similar idea. Basically, these boys are shipwrecked
0:08:50.980000 - 0:08:58.420000::on an island and the, their captain dies, whatever. So it's just the boys. And you're
0:08:58.500000 - 0:09:04.500000::wondering, do the, the kids going to get violent? Well, let's just say there's a character named
0:09:04.500000 - 0:09:11.780000::Piggy in this book that gets his ass handed to him quite literally. He's beaten with what age is Piggy?
0:09:13.620000 - 0:09:20.580000::12, maybe 11. There's a tragedy. I don't, I mean, this is fiction, I think, but I think it's not
0:09:20.580000 - 0:09:26.820000::so fictional because this is probably what would happen. You know what I mean? So Lord of the Flies
0:09:26.820000 - 0:09:31.780000::is about a bunch of people going on a boat and the adults leave the boat. And it's so it's only
0:09:31.780000 - 0:09:35.940000::kids. It's just the kids. There's a shipwreck. I think it's a shipwreck. And the kids are stranded on
0:09:35.940000 - 0:09:43.860000::the island and it's just kids. So it's basically a kid nation style. Huh? So it's like kid nation,
0:09:43.860000 - 0:09:51.940000::but in a book in a book. And the kids go berserk because guess what? Once they get a little hungry,
0:09:51.940000 - 0:09:59.940000::they get a little violent too. And Piggy gets fucking wrecked. But then the adults come.

0:10:00 - 0:10:06.720000::him and well they have to face what they did in their primal state of violence.
0:10:06.720000 - 0:10:09.080000::That sounds like a dope just to say this.
0:10:09.080000 - 0:10:11.880000::I know this is probably a respected book.
0:10:11.880000 - 0:10:16.120000::That sounds like adult propaganda because let me say there's stories of.
0:10:16.120000 - 0:10:18.480000::I bet this was written by how I've seen lost.
0:10:18.480000 - 0:10:25.240000::Have you seen lost because they were some pretty messed up F up at S H I T to each other.
0:10:25.240000 - 0:10:29.360000::And that is a similarly the Lord of the flies style situation.
0:10:29.360000 - 0:10:33.960000::What's the first time in their team and most popular games call of
0:10:33.960000 - 0:10:39.360000::the most popular shows last of us killing most popular.

0:10:40.360000 - 0:10:43.880000::I'm like, can we just get away from this violence for one minute?
0:10:43.880000 - 0:10:50.440000::We need some more like kind of Regis Philbin type shows out there like.
0:10:50.440000 - 0:10:51.440000::He was a monster.

0:10:54.480000 - 0:10:55.480000::Don't say that.
0:10:55.480000 - 0:10:56.480000::No, he said that.
0:10:56.480000 - 0:10:59.560000::He was that him and Kelly didn't get along so good.

0:11:00.880000 - 0:11:01.880000::They were.
0:11:01.880000 - 0:11:02.880000::They were not.

0:11:04.800000 - 0:11:05.800000::What are you?
0:11:05.800000 - 0:11:06.800000::No, you got to be kidding me.

0:11:09.800000 - 0:11:14.200000::Well, I think that Kelly didn't give a ridges the Toma deck because I heard it in every
0:11:14.200000 - 0:11:17.480000::where he's like, I haven't talked to her since the show and did I've reached out.
0:11:17.480000 - 0:11:19.640000::So in that you see why Kelly guess what?
0:11:19.640000 - 0:11:23.360000::You can't reach out to him anymore because he has six feet underground.
0:11:23.360000 - 0:11:26.400000::Well, he can reach out to her in her sleep when he's a demon.
0:11:26.400000 - 0:11:28.320000::I would love to be on the bed.
0:11:28.320000 - 0:11:29.320000::He probably wouldn't be.
0:11:29.320000 - 0:11:30.560000::I would body it if he started.
0:11:30.560000 - 0:11:36.920000::If a ghost started asking me who wants to be a millionaire, I just do feel like I'm
0:11:36.920000 - 0:11:38.280000::waiting to be on that show.
0:11:38.280000 - 0:11:39.600000::Go ahead, ask me a question.
0:11:39.600000 - 0:11:40.920000::A general knowledge question.
0:11:40.920000 - 0:11:49.200000::How many dollars would it take to buy a 2014 Toyota Camry?
0:11:49.200000 - 0:11:55.400000::All right, let me go go to that 14 Toyota Camry.
0:11:56.400000 - 0:11:58.800000::That would be a little understand that this show wouldn't even work.
0:11:58.800000 - 0:11:59.640000::Can I guess?
0:11:59.640000 - 0:12:01.120000::Can we can I guess?
0:12:01.120000 - 0:12:02.120000::Can we all guess this?
0:12:02.120000 - 0:12:03.440000::I know the answer.
0:12:04.560000 - 0:12:06.560000::Oh, I'm going to get this $1,000.
0:12:07.640000 - 0:12:08.240000::$10,000.
0:12:08.240000 - 0:12:09.240000::Nope.
0:12:09.240000 - 0:12:10.240000::Nope.
0:12:10.240000 - 0:12:11.240000::Wait a year.

0:12:44.600000 - 0:12:45.720000::So I didn't do anything.

0:12:52.040000 - 0:12:55.080000::My brain just holds onto the weirdest information.
0:12:55.080000 - 0:12:56.480000::Wait, have you guys heard about this?
0:12:56.480000 - 0:12:59.560000::The self-possessing, repossessing
0:12:59.560000 - 0:13:02.240000::Ford automated vehicle?
0:13:02.240000 - 0:13:03.240000::What is that mean?
0:13:03.240000 - 0:13:04.240000::That is so dystopic.
0:13:04.240000 - 0:13:06.400000::You buy a Ford Hattest dystopic shit like that.
0:13:06.400000 - 0:13:08::So guess what?

0:13:19 - 0:13:21.480000::Once these cars start driving themselves,
0:13:22.520000 - 0:13:25.600000::these cars, if you don't hit a payment,
0:13:25.600000 - 0:13:28.480000::if you're a dollar off on your fucking capital one,
0:13:28.480000 - 0:13:31.440000::auto-plown payment, guess what?
0:13:31.440000 - 0:13:35.120000::That car can drive itself back to the fucking dealership,
0:13:35.120000 - 0:13:36.160000::and guess what?
0:13:36.160000 - 0:13:38.520000::You don't have a fucking car anymore.
0:13:38.520000 - 0:13:39.640000::Thanks technology.

0:13:42.120000 - 0:13:43.280000::It needs to stop now.
0:13:43.280000 - 0:13:44.120000::No more new technology.
0:13:44.120000 - 0:13:45.520000::Where will it end?
0:13:45.520000 - 0:13:46.560000::When is it gonna end?
0:13:46.560000 - 0:13:49.600000::It's gonna end with you fucking your eyes
0:13:49.600000 - 0:13:51.080000::and the back of your fucking head
0:13:51.080000 - 0:13:55.200000::in a little orb of goo, Matrix style, Eric.
0:13:56.320000 - 0:13:57.640000::What about me?
0:13:57.640000 - 0:14:02::Jack, you will be one of the people that is having

0:14:10.400000 - 0:14:13.040000::you're gonna be the only person that good semen,
0:14:13.040000 - 0:14:14.480000::and it's gonna be hell for you,
0:14:14.480000 - 0:14:18.320000::what you're gonna be doing the humanity or a service.
0:14:18.320000 - 0:14:20.640000::I already feel like I'm living that way right now
0:14:20.640000 - 0:14:21.960000::to be honest.
0:14:21.960000 - 0:14:25.280000::I just, something's on my heart that I feel like
0:14:25.280000 - 0:14:27.440000::I need to share with you about the car stuff.
0:14:27.440000 - 0:14:29::I'm not saying, do I share this on the podcast?
0:14:29 - 0:14:30.960000::Do I not share on the podcast?
0:14:30.960000 - 0:14:32.520000::Jack, I didn't know this.
0:14:32.520000 - 0:14:37.520000::Yesterday, I was pulled over for texting and driving.
0:14:39.120000 - 0:14:40.800000::By the police.
0:14:40.800000 - 0:14:42.960000::Did we not just talk about this?
0:14:42.960000 - 0:14:46.240000::We did and literally, are you serious?
0:14:46.240000 - 0:14:48.880000::I'm not being ironic, Sardarant, whatever.
0:14:48.880000 - 0:14:52.320000::This was a wake up call where I was even being pretty
0:14:52.320000 - 0:14:54.480000::chill with it, you know what I mean?
0:14:54.480000 - 0:14:58.960000::But I can't be, and I was going wherever five miles an hour,
0:14:58.960000 - 0:14:59.960000::is too much.

0:15:00 - 0:15:02.600000::It was a, it was on right off my street.
0:15:02.600000 - 0:15:04.760000::Blue, blue, cop, cop pulls over.
0:15:04.760000 - 0:15:06.360000::And I don't like cops like that.
0:15:06.360000 - 0:15:08.840000::So immediately I'm like, so pissed.
0:15:08.840000 - 0:15:09.680000::You got a bad attitude.
0:15:09.680000 - 0:15:12.240000::Then he comes over and says, he said,
0:15:12.240000 - 0:15:14.480000::I rolled over like a yellow belly dog.
0:15:14.480000 - 0:15:18.240000::He's like, he's like, I saw you texting and driving.
0:15:18.240000 - 0:15:19.920000::What are you doing on your phone?
0:15:19.920000 - 0:15:21.480000::And I said, you know what?
0:15:21.480000 - 0:15:23.400000::No, it was no good reason.
0:15:24.640000 - 0:15:26.400000::And to be honest, honestly,
0:15:26.400000 - 0:15:27.720000::because he said,
0:15:27.720000 - 0:15:30.800000::but I respect him for calling me on my shit.
0:15:30.800000 - 0:15:32.040000::And guess what?
0:15:32.040000 - 0:15:34.600000::The same person that left last night,
0:15:34.600000 - 0:15:35.880000::he'd even talk about it at 2 a.m.
0:15:35.880000 - 0:15:39::The same person who was disrespecting his body.
0:15:39 - 0:15:40.720000::That's the same person that's texting and driving.
0:15:40.720000 - 0:15:43.280000::And you won't see his ass ever again.
0:15:43.280000 - 0:15:47.400000::And if you do, he's getting a smack in the face by himself.
0:15:47.400000 - 0:15:49.440000::I can tell that you're going to be given a TED talk
0:15:49.440000 - 0:15:51.040000::in about 50 years,
0:15:51.040000 - 0:15:52.320000::where you're going to be saying,
0:15:52.320000 - 0:15:54.360000::just describing this rock bottom,
0:15:54.360000 - 0:15:57.360000::I was eating fast food at night.
0:15:57.360000 - 0:16:00.960000::And I was looking at Google Maps while I was driving.
0:16:00.960000 - 0:16:03.160000::And all of a sudden,
0:16:03.160000 - 0:16:04.120000::all of a sudden this cop,
0:16:04.120000 - 0:16:06.400000::I almost got arrested for the rest of my life.
0:16:06.400000 - 0:16:07.400000::And he said, you know what?
0:16:07.400000 - 0:16:09::I'm going to give you one more chance.
0:16:09 - 0:16:10.640000::I'm going to give you a ticket for now,
0:16:10.640000 - 0:16:12.520000::but I'm going to come to your house in 60 days.
0:16:12.520000 - 0:16:15.920000::And if you are not below 18% body fat,
0:16:15.920000 - 0:16:18.680000::and if you have any drugs in your system,
0:16:18.680000 - 0:16:19.520000::thank you.
0:16:19.520000 - 0:16:20.760000::Take you to jail.
0:16:20.760000 - 0:16:22.360000::Oh, no jail.
0:16:23.240000 - 0:16:24.480000::Well, that's the type of cops.
0:16:24.480000 - 0:16:26.160000::Let's type of laws we need.
0:16:27.040000 - 0:16:29.440000::We I can't really laws.
0:16:29.440000 - 0:16:32.600000::Yeah, but do it with that positive spin.
0:16:32.600000 - 0:16:34.440000::It isn't be tailored to the individual.
0:16:34.440000 - 0:16:35.440000::Like if you want,
0:16:35.440000 - 0:16:36.640000::if you want to like, you know,
0:16:36.640000 - 0:16:39.440000::lose this whatever, get your fitness goals,
0:16:39.440000 - 0:16:41.880000::there should be a cop that can, you know,
0:16:41.880000 - 0:16:45.720000::legally put you in jail if you don't achieve,
0:16:45.720000 - 0:16:49.280000::you know, your personal growth goals, you know?
0:16:49.280000 - 0:16:50.120000::Right.
0:16:50.120000 - 0:16:50.960000::That's what we're missing.
0:16:50.960000 - 0:16:52.880000::That's why nobody can hit them.
0:16:52.880000 - 0:16:54.760000::In jail though, if you didn't meet it outside,
0:16:54.760000 - 0:16:56.320000::that's actually where you get the shit done.
0:16:56.320000 - 0:16:57.880000::And it's almost a service to be.
0:16:57.880000 - 0:16:59.760000::And by the way, let's abolish all prisons, whatever.
0:16:59.760000 - 0:17:01.880000::But in these will be nice jails.
0:17:01.880000 - 0:17:04.040000::And these will be well equipped.
0:17:04.040000 - 0:17:05.600000::And you could walk out whenever you want.
0:17:05.600000 - 0:17:08.800000::But also a bunch of you put it in focus.
0:17:08.800000 - 0:17:10.560000::Like Mike Tyson focused for three years.
0:17:10.560000 - 0:17:12.840000::He said it was the best thing I ever have known.
0:17:12.840000 - 0:17:16.320000::I mean, I just want to have YouTube short today.
0:17:17.840000 - 0:17:20.240000::Eric, you would not also say like we're,
0:17:20.240000 - 0:17:22.520000::I just want to comment on it because we,
0:17:22.520000 - 0:17:25.040000::people that we don't give ourselves pets on the back enough,
0:17:25.040000 - 0:17:28::we're doing so good this podcast on talking and like just
0:17:28 - 0:17:31.760000::yelling, it's like literally there 10,000 hours.
0:17:31.760000 - 0:17:34.120000::We probably only need a hundred to get good at this shit.
0:17:34.120000 - 0:17:35.080000::And we're almost there.
0:17:35.080000 - 0:17:35.920000::Right.
0:17:35.920000 - 0:17:39.920000::Imagine what we get, what it was this episode eight or something?
0:17:39.920000 - 0:17:41.360000::Imagine episode three hundred.
0:17:41.360000 - 0:17:42.280000::Yeah, but we got way more.
0:17:42.280000 - 0:17:43.120000::Haven't we?
0:17:43.120000 - 0:17:47.360000::Oh, we, but I can't imagine the chemistry that we're having.
0:17:47.360000 - 0:17:49.760000::It's like our big things.
0:17:49.760000 - 0:17:50.920000::Oh, what about this?
0:17:50.920000 - 0:17:51.760000::What about this?
0:17:51.760000 - 0:17:53.680000::It's hard to, it's hard.
0:17:53.680000 - 0:17:55.360000::It's hard to imagine.
0:17:55.360000 - 0:17:59.720000::It's hard to imagine being any better at podcasting than I am now,
0:18:00.040000 - 0:18:04.840000::given what my talent set of is like.
0:18:05.440000 - 0:18:07.160000::You think you've peaked?
0:18:07.160000 - 0:18:08.920000::I do kind of think I've hit a plateau.
0:18:08.920000 - 0:18:10.600000::And it's like, what do I need?
0:18:10.600000 - 0:18:11.600000::I need a substance.
0:18:11.600000 - 0:18:12.600000::I need a drug.
0:18:12.600000 - 0:18:14.640000::I need a PED in my head.
0:18:14.640000 - 0:18:16.520000::I need a mental steroid.
0:18:16.520000 - 0:18:20.800000::I think that there is going to be a point in this podcast when it might
0:18:20.800000 - 0:18:26.360000::be like a couple of months from now where you hit a zone where we're going to have
0:18:26.360000 - 0:18:34.840000::to sit you down personally off the pod and be like, Jack, you are like just too good.
0:18:35.360000 - 0:18:39.680000::And you, we're going to like kind of hand off the, the, the rain, see you.
0:18:39.680000 - 0:18:42.480000::Everyone has come into the podcast just specifically for you.
0:18:42.480000 - 0:18:42.680000::Yeah.
0:18:42.680000 - 0:18:45::What you've been bringing these last couple episodes.
0:18:45 - 0:18:46.680000::You want to get a table done right now?
0:18:46.680000 - 0:18:47.480000::I'll give it to you.
0:18:47.480000 - 0:18:48.480000::You want to get a taste of it?
0:18:49.320000 - 0:18:50.320000::Yeah, please.
0:18:50.320000 - 0:18:51.360000::All right, here you go.
0:18:51.360000 - 0:18:54.360000::So what do you guys think could take with this Jake Paul fight, right?
0:18:54.360000 - 0:18:57.560000::Jake Paul Tommy Fury, big boxing fight, YouTube personality.
0:18:57.560000 - 0:18:58.160000::Who's going to win?
0:18:58.160000 - 0:19:02.240000::I mean, it's pretty absurd that Jake Paul went in there thinking that he was going to win.
0:19:02.240000 - 0:19:03.480000::And he finally gets in with a boxer.
0:19:03.480000 - 0:19:06.360000::We've all been wondering what's he going to do against boxer, actual boxer, actual boxer.
0:19:06.360000 - 0:19:07.360000::You have to see guys, right?
0:19:07.360000 - 0:19:08.840000::And he gets smoked.
0:19:08.840000 - 0:19:10.240000::I mean, what do you guys think about that, right?
0:19:11.240000 - 0:19:12.240000::Holy.
0:19:12.240000 - 0:19:13.320000::And I'm Joey Diaz.
0:19:13.320000 - 0:19:14.320000::I'm talking back to you.
0:19:14.800000 - 0:19:15.800000::I don't know.
0:19:15.800000 - 0:19:18::I was all coked out in 1988.
0:19:18 - 0:19:25.200000::And so that's what we could think of guys.
0:19:25.200000 - 0:19:28.240000::He always talks like he's got crazy mucus all up in his throat.
0:19:28.240000 - 0:19:29.240000::Right.
0:19:29.240000 - 0:19:30.240000::He is not getting the throat up.
0:19:30.240000 - 0:19:37.040000::No, no, actually, I would not let Joey Diaz on get the stay the fuck away from us.
0:19:37.040000 - 0:19:38.040000::Joseph cocaine.
0:19:38.040000 - 0:19:39.040000::Yes.
0:19:39.040000 - 0:19:40.040000::So wait.
0:19:41.040000 - 0:19:42.040000::So wait.
0:19:42.040000 - 0:19:48.040000::So I mean, you jokingly brought it up, but Jake Paul did hit the ring and he lost a fight.
0:19:48.040000 - 0:19:49.040000::Is this his first loss?
0:19:49.040000 - 0:19:53.520000::This is his first loss, but it's the it's his first loss.
0:19:53.520000 - 0:19:55.200000::And it's so humiliating.
0:19:55.200000 - 0:19:57.880000::The idea of me is the best example of toxic hit hit.
0:19:57.880000 - 0:19:59.280000::You know what I mean?
0:19:59.280000 - 0:20:00.280000::Right.

0:20:00 - 0:20:02.120000::Yeah, like talk shit shit, like it smacked.
0:20:02.120000 - 0:20:04.840000::Because like if you like wanna like talk mad shit
0:20:04.840000 - 0:20:06.560000::and it's like that, what you don't realize
0:20:06.560000 - 0:20:08.200000::is that when you talk shit to somebody,
0:20:08.200000 - 0:20:09.640000::you're making them more and more mad.
0:20:09.640000 - 0:20:13.200000::And it's like if you're gonna touch the stove,
0:20:14.280000 - 0:20:15.120000::that's good.
0:20:15.120000 - 0:20:17.480000::You know what I wanna do is those, you know where they have
0:20:17.480000 - 0:20:20::the pre-fights where they do like a press conference
0:20:20 - 0:20:22.640000::and they get in each other's faces.
0:20:22.640000 - 0:20:24.880000::I don't wanna fight, but I wanna be a part of something
0:20:24.880000 - 0:20:25.720000::like that.
0:20:25.720000 - 0:20:28.960000::Like I wish I could just like take out the fight part
0:20:28.960000 - 0:20:31.800000::and just like be face to face with somebody
0:20:31.800000 - 0:20:34.560000::and like, you know what you like to do?
0:20:34.560000 - 0:20:36.600000::Do you do something physical or would you?
0:20:36.600000 - 0:20:40.080000::I, well you weren't, you know how you're not supposed to.
0:20:40.080000 - 0:20:41.600000::Like there's a lot of tension there
0:20:41.600000 - 0:20:44.600000::and like sometimes somebody like slapped other person
0:20:44.600000 - 0:20:45.440000::or whatever.
0:20:45.440000 - 0:20:47.200000::I would definitely cross that line I think where
0:20:47.200000 - 0:20:49.480000::I would, you thought I'd share it with someone.
0:20:49.480000 - 0:20:51.880000::Because you're trying to like, you know,
0:20:51.880000 - 0:20:56.880000::the whole preamble to the fight is like generating interest
0:20:57.160000 - 0:20:59.080000::and there has to be as much beef as possible
0:20:59.080000 - 0:20:59.920000::leading up to it.
0:20:59.920000 - 0:21:02.360000::Cause it gets you know more people involved in the fight.
0:21:02.360000 - 0:21:06.160000::So I would focus, I feel like I need to be like a PR rep
0:21:06.160000 - 0:21:11.080000::on just that phase of the pre-fight kind of stuff
0:21:11.080000 - 0:21:11.680000::to make it as-
0:21:11.680000 - 0:21:13.760000::The storyline get people as possible.
0:21:13.760000 - 0:21:17.280000::Like Jake Paul needs to like have sex with other persons mom
0:21:17.280000 - 0:21:19.280000::and like film it and put it out and pour in another point.
0:21:19.280000 - 0:21:20.680000::Dude, dude, dude, dude.
0:21:20.680000 - 0:21:21.680000::Hey.
0:21:21.680000 - 0:21:23.720000::Even hearing that I'm like getting all pissed off
0:21:23.720000 - 0:21:25.640000::as for the other fighter.
0:21:25.640000 - 0:21:28.240000::So wait, dude, like you're amazing at this.
0:21:28.240000 - 0:21:29.560000::I don't know.
0:21:29.560000 - 0:21:31.400000::I don't know.
0:21:31.400000 - 0:21:36.880000::I just, I'm really good at devising conflict, I think.
0:21:36.880000 - 0:21:38.760000::Well, let's just speak into that.
0:21:38.760000 - 0:21:41.160000::You know what's funny is I've is,
0:21:42.560000 - 0:21:46.080000::Will Smith did a slap and what he didn't realize is
0:21:46.080000 - 0:21:47.640000::he slapped what you do.
0:21:47.640000 - 0:21:49.640000::When you hit an object, it moved somewhere
0:21:49.640000 - 0:21:51.080000::and that object was Chris Rock
0:21:51.080000 - 0:21:52.440000::and it bounced all around the world
0:21:52.440000 - 0:21:54.800000::getting perspective from every country on the planet.
0:21:54.800000 - 0:21:56.560000::Landed right back in Baltimore, Maryland
0:21:56.560000 - 0:21:58.480000::to film the craziest special of all time.
0:21:58.480000 - 0:21:59.320000::Boom.
0:21:59.320000 - 0:22:01.920000::And Chris Rock hit him with the spoiler alert.
0:22:01.920000 - 0:22:05.320000::Chris Rock said, oh yeah, spoiler alert,
0:22:05.320000 - 0:22:07.040000::this is the last line of the special.
0:22:07.040000 - 0:22:09.400000::He said, guess what, Will Smith?
0:22:09.400000 - 0:22:13.080000::I have parents and then he dropped the mic
0:22:13.080000 - 0:22:16.960000::and I thought, whoa, if I had a, forget one year,
0:22:16.960000 - 0:22:19.800000::if I had 10 years, I couldn't come up with that.
0:22:19.800000 - 0:22:21.440000::That is what you call.
0:22:22.400000 - 0:22:23.600000::You know Chris Rock,
0:22:23.600000 - 0:22:25.520000::listen to this podcast, right?
0:22:25.520000 - 0:22:26.800000::Jack, do you want that enemy?
0:22:26.800000 - 0:22:28.440000::Do you really want that?
0:22:28.440000 - 0:22:29.440000::I'm not dude.
0:22:29.440000 - 0:22:31.360000::No, I know because if he's talk shit,
0:22:31.360000 - 0:22:33.280000::what if he says to me, he's, what if he, if dude,
0:22:33.280000 - 0:22:35.600000::if Chris Rock said to me, oh yeah,
0:22:35.600000 - 0:22:37.040000::you talk shit about my podcast?
0:22:37.040000 - 0:22:38.560000::Well, guess what I have to say?
0:22:38.560000 - 0:22:40.880000::Yeah, you talk shit about me on your podcast.
0:22:40.880000 - 0:22:41.880000::Guess what I have to say?
0:22:45.560000 - 0:22:46.320000::What did you not have?
0:22:46.320000 - 0:22:48.920000::What did you not have good parents?
0:22:48.920000 - 0:22:50.480000::I would probably jump right off a bridge
0:22:50.480000 - 0:22:51.480000::and I'd run to a spike.
0:22:53.480000 - 0:22:54.480000::Right then and there.
0:22:55.600000 - 0:22:57.600000::He doesn't want any smoke with any of us.
0:22:57.600000 - 0:22:59::Let's just leave it at that.
0:22:59 - 0:23:00.120000::I'd smoke with Chris Rock.
0:23:01.080000 - 0:23:02.680000::Well, of course.
0:23:02.680000 - 0:23:06.800000::But it is unfortunate that it has to be,
0:23:06.800000 - 0:23:09.960000::we have to waste our time and our amazing artists
0:23:09.960000 - 0:23:12.200000::on silly beef like this.
0:23:12.200000 - 0:23:15.800000::It's like, imagine if Galileo is an artist
0:23:15.800000 - 0:23:16.760000::or is that a thinker?
0:23:17.760000 - 0:23:19.680000::There's two, you can either be,
0:23:19.680000 - 0:23:21.880000::there are two categories of people.
0:23:21.880000 - 0:23:22.720000::Really?
0:23:22.720000 - 0:23:23.560000::Thinkers and artists.
0:23:23.560000 - 0:23:28.560000::Well, what I mean is imagine if Michelangelo,
0:23:28.560000 - 0:23:29.720000::that's the painting, right?
0:23:29.720000 - 0:23:30.560000::Right.
0:23:30.560000 - 0:23:33.840000::So imagine if Michelangelo spent his time
0:23:33.840000 - 0:23:36.400000::spending a year making some petty ass painting
0:23:36.400000 - 0:23:37.760000::of some dude who kind of like,
0:23:37.760000 - 0:23:38.960000::talked shit about one of his horses
0:23:38.960000 - 0:23:40.160000::or something back in the day.
0:23:40.160000 - 0:23:41.600000::And we never got the Sistine Chapel.
0:23:41.600000 - 0:23:43.920000::We got some weird caricature of somebody
0:23:43.920000 - 0:23:46.760000::with fucked up teeth on top of like a hut
0:23:46.760000 - 0:23:49.120000::where they make soup that everybody goes to.
0:23:49.160000 - 0:23:50.680000::That's kind of what Chris Rock is doing here
0:23:50.680000 - 0:23:52.800000::by giving his energy and time,
0:23:52.800000 - 0:23:55.400000::dedicating a special to the slap.
0:23:56.400000 - 0:23:58.360000::So you think he should have never even mentioned it
0:23:58.360000 - 0:24:02.280000::and kind of like been above it in a way.
0:24:03.440000 - 0:24:04.280000::I do.
0:24:04.280000 - 0:24:08.200000::I think, you know, if somebody slaps you at the Oscars,
0:24:08.200000 - 0:24:11.040000::you have to say, hey man, I was at work.
0:24:12.280000 - 0:24:14.240000::And you did something embarrassing.
0:24:14.240000 - 0:24:16.520000::I'm not gonna let that change my trajectory
0:24:16.520000 - 0:24:18.320000::because I'm shooting for the moon right now.
0:24:18.320000 - 0:24:20.360000::I'm landing amongst the stars or whatever,
0:24:20.360000 - 0:24:22.080000::whichever way you say that.
0:24:22.080000 - 0:24:24.680000::And so he's stooping down to Will Smith's level
0:24:24.680000 - 0:24:28.720000::and what it is is humiliation.
0:24:28.720000 - 0:24:33.240000::Because now he's almost doing something in a sense
0:24:33.240000 - 0:24:35.320000::is such a sense in a way that's making me not
0:24:35.320000 - 0:24:37.920000::wanna even be thinking that I like it.
0:24:40.680000 - 0:24:42.840000::You'll notice I've been quiet for the last about minutes.
0:24:42.840000 - 0:24:44.400000::Yeah, I've been noticing, right?
0:24:44.400000 - 0:24:46::Eric, you have been shocking.
0:24:46.480000 - 0:24:48.920000::You're afraid to speak on this entire question.
0:24:48.920000 - 0:24:50.920000::Which makes me think that you have,
0:24:50.920000 - 0:24:53.440000::you have an opinion that you are withholding
0:24:53.440000 - 0:24:54.960000::or you don't have any.
0:24:54.960000 - 0:24:57.080000::Listen, listen, I'll tell you how it is.
0:24:57.080000 - 0:25:00.080000::Whenever the Chris Rock slap gets brought up,

0:25:00 - 0:25:05::I go to a place in my head that is whatever March 12, 2022.
0:25:06.440000 - 0:25:09.200000::And it is like pressing rewind on a,
0:25:09.200000 - 0:25:12.160000::it's like watching a vine over and over again.
0:25:12.160000 - 0:25:15.920000::And I just, I just see it over and over again.
0:25:15.920000 - 0:25:19.320000::And it's like I get stuck in some type of time loop.
0:25:19.320000 - 0:25:22.720000::And I just, I wonder if Will Smith realizes
0:25:22.720000 - 0:25:27.560000::that he was traumatizing the whole world with one slap.
0:25:28.520000 - 0:25:31.400000::And if he imagined being in the Oscars right that night,
0:25:31.400000 - 0:25:32.560000::you'd go home.
0:25:32.560000 - 0:25:33.560000::Yes, I could have.
0:25:34.160000 - 0:25:35.360000::Yes, I can imagine it.
0:25:35.360000 - 0:25:36.360000::The Oscars.
0:25:36.840000 - 0:25:39.840000::Well, I always imagine being at the Oscars.
0:25:40.360000 - 0:25:43.600000::We should go South Park style when we get invited.
0:25:43.600000 - 0:25:45.360000::Uh oh, man, Traylor Park.
0:25:45.360000 - 0:25:47.720000::They better not go on the Oscars.
0:25:47.720000 - 0:25:49.960000::I would be crazy on the red car.
0:25:49.960000 - 0:25:52.440000::It's TV asking my name and they say, excuse me, Jack,
0:25:52.440000 - 0:25:54::I'm gonna say that's not my name's not Jack.
0:25:54 - 0:25:54.920000::My name is, ooh,
0:25:55.880000 - 0:25:58.640000::on a fucking tripping on acid heart.
0:25:58.640000 - 0:25:59.640000::So,
0:25:59.640000 - 0:26:01.440000::no, no, no, listen, instead of acid,
0:26:01.440000 - 0:26:04.480000::we're gonna be so, you go like 12 shots deep.
0:26:04.480000 - 0:26:05.480000::Hello.
0:26:06.480000 - 0:26:08.480000::Everybody finds out after we drink this,
0:26:08.480000 - 0:26:11.680000::and then they throw respect on your name for the rest of your life.
0:26:11.680000 - 0:26:14.160000::Yo, he was drunk as fuck at the Oscars.
0:26:14.160000 - 0:26:15.920000::Yeah, he was eating a tuna sandwich
0:26:15.920000 - 0:26:18::on a more sharp and most people can handle.
0:26:19.600000 - 0:26:24.200000::The thing is, these are gonna do different lambs are so incredibly
0:26:24.920000 - 0:26:28.680000::ripe for amazing incredible moments to happen.
0:26:28.680000 - 0:26:32.760000::Like the, like the Kanye West coming up and dead, dead, dead.
0:26:32.760000 - 0:26:35.960000::We, we almost watched these award shows.
0:26:35.960000 - 0:26:40.600000::And just because we've had a little taste of how they can, you know, derail,
0:26:40.600000 - 0:26:44.520000::I feel like we almost have an appetite for the things that could go wrong.
0:26:44.520000 - 0:26:47.040000::Like the moonlight, you know, uh, fucking thing.
0:26:47.040000 - 0:26:49.240000::We're almost every award show.
0:26:49.240000 - 0:26:52.480000::We want something crazy fucked up to go down.
0:26:52.480000 - 0:26:57::And I'm gonna tell you if Hollywood, which I think they will very soon kind of
0:26:57 - 0:27:00.680000::wise enough to my sort of talent pool and level and how, you know,
0:27:00.680000 - 0:27:05.520000::amazingly I can ring to different sort of multi-hyphenate disciplines.
0:27:05.520000 - 0:27:10.720000::If they give me a shot, just, I just want to let you know, right fucking now.
0:27:10.720000 - 0:27:15.720000::You put me in an Oscars in the Emmys as a presenter in the audience.
0:27:15.720000 - 0:27:16.480000::I don't even care.
0:27:16.480000 - 0:27:19.720000::Just let me in that room and guess what?
0:27:19.720000 - 0:27:25.200000::We're gonna have one of the craziest fucking moments that you have ever seen on live
0:27:25.200000 - 0:27:26.200000::television.
0:27:26.200000 - 0:27:31.040000::You should be able to guarantee that you could cause mass injury with no death and minor
0:27:31.040000 - 0:27:33.840000::infragents enough to where people are like screaming.
0:27:33.840000 - 0:27:35.040000::Oh, dude, great.
0:27:35.040000 - 0:27:36.040000::That bad.
0:27:36.040000 - 0:27:40.200000::Nate, if you got invited to the Oscars and you got a basketball and you dribbled past
0:27:40.200000 - 0:27:43.520000::every single person and broke all their ankles and everybody got a sprained ankle because
0:27:43.520000 - 0:27:48.320000::you were dribbling, dribbling up all on everybody.
0:27:48.320000 - 0:27:49.320000::That would be viral.
0:27:49.320000 - 0:27:52.160000::And by the way, you know what I'd be doing at Oscars, right?
0:27:52.160000 - 0:27:57.320000::Here I go, presenting an award for the most dramatic award ever to be given, right?
0:27:57.320000 - 0:27:58.320000::Right.
0:27:58.320000 - 0:27:59.320000::Oh, shit.
0:27:59.320000 - 0:28:00.320000::And then, bam.
0:28:00.320000 - 0:28:02.160000::And I do something like this.
0:28:02.160000 - 0:28:09::And the contrast artistically of an extremely dramatic award being given out to an extremely
0:28:09 - 0:28:17.840000::rapid, rapid, important actor, reputable actor with somebody with a silly eyeballs like
0:28:17.840000 - 0:28:20.360000::this.
0:28:20.360000 - 0:28:21.360000::That's fun.
0:28:21.360000 - 0:28:26.040000::These are the ideas that separate us from the boring type of less creative type of people.
0:28:26.040000 - 0:28:31.840000::Can we do something right now where each one of us, we each get 20 seconds to do an award
0:28:31.840000 - 0:28:36.920000::speech and we, I'm gonna give you the movie that you won it for the role and then you gotta
0:28:36.920000 - 0:28:39.920000::give me 20 seconds of fire heat.
0:28:39.920000 - 0:28:42.960000::The best, you didn't write anything down because you're too humble to think you have what
0:28:42.960000 - 0:28:43.960000::of one.
0:28:43.960000 - 0:28:46.640000::So that's what you would all do.
0:28:46.640000 - 0:28:50.080000::If we're at an award show, we're in the audience, we're not writing down a damn fucking
0:28:50.080000 - 0:28:51.080000::thing.
0:28:51.080000 - 0:28:55.280000::We're gonna get up there like, um, okay, well, we'll just, I'll let it spit as a, as
0:28:55.280000 - 0:28:56.280000::well.
0:28:56.280000 - 0:28:57.280000::All right.
0:28:57.280000 - 0:29:06.240000::You just won best actor for starring in a movie about the plight of basically American
0:29:06.240000 - 0:29:12.120000::farmers in the dust bowl in the whatever 1920s.
0:29:12.120000 - 0:29:20::And in the movie, your wife dies in your arms and you shriek and cry for four minutes
0:29:20 - 0:29:21.040000::straight.
0:29:21.040000 - 0:29:23.720000::And that's what they play when you win.
0:29:23.720000 - 0:29:26::So all right.
0:29:26 - 0:29:31.520000::So I'd get up on the stage and it would take me a long time to get up on stage first
0:29:31.520000 - 0:29:32.520000::off.
0:29:32.520000 - 0:29:34.720000::Like, it would be like, people would kind of have to tap me on the shoulder and I would
0:29:34.720000 - 0:29:38.640000::kind of be like, like, kind of not understand like what an award show is.
0:29:38.640000 - 0:29:40.680000::Like, do I have to get up to the stage or not?
0:29:40.680000 - 0:29:42.880000::Because you were meditating up until this point.
0:29:42.880000 - 0:29:47.280000::You're composing the entire, and I'm kind of shocked out of it where I'm like, where
0:29:47.280000 - 0:29:48.280000::am I?
0:29:48.280000 - 0:29:49.280000::Like, what's going on?
0:29:49.280000 - 0:29:52.680000::People are kind of like shaking me and they think I'm like kind of dead.
0:29:52.680000 - 0:29:56.320000::And like big celebrities are coming up to me, you know, like Leslie Jones or whatever,
0:29:56.320000 - 0:29:57.840000::like shaking the fucking shit out of me.
0:29:57.840000 - 0:29:59.360000::They're worried.
0:29:59.360000 - 0:30:00.200000::And they're kind of like, kind of like,

0:30:00 - 0:30:03.120000::cutting to commercial, but then I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, stop, stop, stop, stop.
0:30:03.120000 - 0:30:07.400000::And I can bring the mic to my table and I do the speech out there.
0:30:07.400000 - 0:30:15.840000::And I'm like, you know, like, I actually didn't prepare anything right now.
0:30:15.840000 - 0:30:20.080000::And I didn't think that I would win, but I just want to say that I deserve this.
0:30:20.080000 - 0:30:23.440000::And a lot of people think that they should be humbled by this,
0:30:23.440000 - 0:30:28.640000::but I want to say every single person in this category, you didn't bring it this year.
0:30:28.640000 - 0:30:31.920000::And it's kind of clear why the voters picked me and not you.
0:30:31.920000 - 0:30:34.720000::And I want to, the cameraman, cameraman, cameraman, listen up,
0:30:34.720000 - 0:30:36.080000::cut to all their faces right now.
0:30:36.080000 - 0:30:37.240000::I want you to see their faces.
0:30:37.240000 - 0:30:37.920000::I'm saying this.
0:30:37.920000 - 0:30:41.520000::So kind of put them all at the same time where you can see everybody's face.
0:30:41.520000 - 0:30:45.680000::So I'm saying this, step it up because you just lost the goat.
0:30:45.680000 - 0:30:48.480000::And you're going to have to bring it a little bit harder this year,
0:30:48.480000 - 0:30:52.520000::Merrill Streep, or you know, the genders are kind of mixed now in this version of the
0:30:52.520000 - 0:30:54.880000::oxasers where it's not like male or female.
0:30:54.880000 - 0:30:57.360000::It's like, all the genders are in the same category now.
0:30:57.360000 - 0:31:01.040000::We should gender every job and on your podcast, step your shit up.
0:31:01.040000 - 0:31:01.920000::Because guess what?
0:31:01.920000 - 0:31:03.240000::I'm going to film next year.
0:31:03.240000 - 0:31:04.040000::And guess what?
0:31:04.040000 - 0:31:06::I'm probably going to get nominated and guess what?
0:31:06 - 0:31:08.920000::I'm probably going to win next year again in this.
0:31:09.320000 - 0:31:15.240000::And you better step up your fucking game because I'm not going anywhere.
0:31:15.240000 - 0:31:16.320000::I'm not going to die.
0:31:16.320000 - 0:31:20.240000::I'm going to be working every year coming out with prestigious films for the rest of my
0:31:20.240000 - 0:31:21.240000::fucking life.
0:31:21.240000 - 0:31:22.680000::So guess what?
0:31:22.680000 - 0:31:25.080000::No more awards for you as long as I'm in the game.
0:31:25.080000 - 0:31:27.080000::So y'all are going to have to cancel my ass.
0:31:27.080000 - 0:31:28.960000::Playing music is playing.
0:31:28.960000 - 0:31:29.960000::Stop the music.
0:31:29.960000 - 0:31:31.680000::Stop the fucking music.
0:31:31.680000 - 0:31:34.760000::Do not fucking play me off.
0:31:34.760000 - 0:31:35.680000::Security comes in.
0:31:35.680000 - 0:31:36.400000::Starts dragging you.
0:31:36.400000 - 0:31:37::Security comes in.
0:31:37 - 0:31:39.280000::I'm fucking choke them out like there.
0:31:39.280000 - 0:31:40.880000::Oh shit.
0:31:40.880000 - 0:31:41.400000::Damn.
0:31:41.400000 - 0:31:43.760000::So you went kind of evil Nate with that.
0:31:43.760000 - 0:31:45.960000::I like it when people make it up.
0:31:45.960000 - 0:31:48.640000::They like it when I get a little evil with it.
0:31:48.640000 - 0:31:51.280000::Don't you like it when I get a little twist?
0:31:51.280000 - 0:31:52.280000::Yes.
0:31:52.280000 - 0:31:52.800000::Yeah.

0:34:00.920000 - 0:34:04.080000::I go on stage and then I go quiet.
0:34:04.080000 - 0:34:09.040000::I go quiet and I point my finger up up to the ceiling and saying like, this is got this

0:34:25.560000 - 0:34:27.280000::Shooting it into the air.
0:34:27.280000 - 0:34:28.480000::No one's hurt.
0:34:28.480000 - 0:34:31.920000::It's just blanks and but one real bullet that goes through the ceiling.
0:34:31.920000 - 0:34:34.960000::And I say, I got your attention now.
0:34:34.960000 - 0:34:39.040000::I said, you all watched a movie about a dying man someone sick.
0:34:39.040000 - 0:34:45.240000::Why do we give so much care to the sick and not the un sick because go around the movie
0:34:45.240000 - 0:34:46.240000::air?
0:34:46.240000 - 0:34:47.240000::So many damn ass.
0:34:47.240000 - 0:34:48.240000::What's that?
0:34:48.240000 - 0:34:50.240000::I wrote the movie though.
0:34:50.240000 - 0:34:51.560000::Oh, I wrote the movie.
0:34:51.560000 - 0:34:57.120000::Well, I say my eyes have been open like saw turning the pole.
0:34:57.120000 - 0:34:59.160000::The scales fell for my eyes.
0:34:59.160000 - 0:35:00::This was a garbage.

0:35:00 - 0:35:06.560000::trash ass. I still knocked out the fucking part. We need to fix gun violence in the United States
0:35:06.560000 - 0:35:10.960000::right now. All the gun owners in here right now, Matthew McConaughey, I know you got
0:35:10.960000 - 0:35:16.160000::for a hundred guns in your basement. Lala, lala, lala. I'm saying all you hypocrites throw
0:35:16.160000 - 0:35:20.480000::the guns out now and I don't care about the reward. But then I say and spike by the way,
0:35:20.480000 - 0:35:25.600000::you hooked it up majorly. Thank you for having my ass on this spike. You know you always got
0:35:26.560000 - 0:35:30.160000::whatever. Scarlett Johansson, thank you for leaving Mr. Colin Joe's for my ass.
0:35:34.480000 - 0:35:40.240000::So you would get like kind of a reward have a political statement. It's not about you. It's about,
0:35:40.240000 - 0:35:46.640000::it's this is a grander thing, you know, which is I respect that so much. And you shoot a gun.
0:35:46.640000 - 0:35:52.400000::Hide in a gun. Because a lot of these people they get these awards and they think producers,
0:35:52.400000 - 0:35:57.600000::they think the production company, the studio, but they forget that millions of people are watching
0:35:57.600000 - 0:36:03.440000::this right now. And are you going to take this moment selfishly to say thank you to the fucking
0:36:03.440000 - 0:36:10.160000::Lionsgate. The Harvey Weinstein. Thank you for putting me. No, this isn't about you. This award is not
0:36:10.160000 - 0:36:16.240000::about you any longer. Guess what it's about us, the collective, and how we can change the world as
0:36:16.240000 - 0:36:22.080000::actors and influencers in this world because people rely on us and they trust our opinion and they
0:36:22.080000 - 0:36:27.360000::want us to say things that will make the world a better place. And that's your responsibility.
0:36:28 - 0:36:31.040000::You're going to get on stage and you're going to everybody's going to be looking at you and then
0:36:31.040000 - 0:36:34.080000::you're going to take out a gun and you're going to say and you're going to shoot it and say,
0:36:34.080000 - 0:36:41.600000::now are you paying attention to me? So unnecessary. It's kind of like it's kind of like right. They were
0:36:41.600000 - 0:36:45.440000::looking at everybody may have been looking at you on stage in that moment, but were they really
0:36:45.440000 - 0:36:53.600000::listening? I feel like you were to do that. What's that? If you were to do that, I think it would backfire
0:36:53.600000 - 0:36:59.120000::and you would get like, you know, immediately not get let into the theater. Like there would be
0:36:59.120000 - 0:37:03.120000::like a check on you and they would be like, it would be a whole thing of like, I guess Eric's not,
0:37:03.120000 - 0:37:06.800000::you know, going to be attending because you were so I actually bringing the strap in.
0:37:08 - 0:37:12.560000::I think you're wrong because I think they would see that bravery in me. And be like, yeah,
0:37:12.560000 - 0:37:16.960000::he's coming to every fucking one even if he's not. So for the rest of my life when I'm
0:37:16.960000 - 0:37:22.880000::fucking dying all dead, killed over, I'm still one of the Oscars, even though I haven't
0:37:22.880000 - 0:37:30::done a movie in 20 years. That's how much I like my ass. And I will stop gun violence. What's that?
0:37:32 - 0:37:36.720000::If you get nominated or if you win, you get invited to the Oscars every year for the rest of your
0:37:36.720000 - 0:37:41.120000::life. You know that? Well, can you imagine if you were the one person to stop gun violence?
0:37:43.120000 - 0:37:50.320000::You realize that if you stop gun violence, if you stop gun violence, that something even more
0:37:50.320000 - 0:37:56.240000::violence just can replace it. So I'm almost afraid to get rid of guns. Because then what? Everybody's
0:37:56.240000 - 0:38:02::going to start owning what? But that's the thing is like a new crazy invention has to come along
0:38:02.080000 - 0:38:08.560000::in order for that violence to be matched. You know what I mean? And I just can't think of it like
0:38:10.240000 - 0:38:17.600000::there's knives. I can think of a couple. Let's just say you could knock over a heavy object
0:38:17.600000 - 0:38:24.400000::onto somebody. You can say large rocks that you know, like set some kind of fire. Some
0:38:24.400000 - 0:38:31.040000::fighters are available around the corner. Okay. You can kill someone with a sock. Wow.
0:38:31.040000 - 0:38:36.160000::If it's wet enough, if it's way in a million different ways, you could choke them on. I don't
0:38:36.160000 - 0:38:40.160000::want to go into it. But that's what that's the way my brain works is I could think of all the type of
0:38:40.160000 - 0:38:44.560000::object. Like you kill someone with a phone, right? Other other. I mean, you're killing their life by
0:38:44.560000 - 0:38:49.440000::addicted them to social media. But you could smack someone hard enough with a phone to kill them.
0:38:49.440000 - 0:38:53.200000::Or you could kiss somebody with a phone. You could love them through a phone. That's right. You
0:38:53.200000 - 0:38:58.160000::can't love somebody through a gun. Isn't that song? That's me. You got to do your acceptance
0:38:58.160000 - 0:39:04.640000::speech. All right. I got to give them a roll. What's your. Your role? What is this?
0:39:05.920000 - 0:39:13.840000::Okay. You let's see. Let me think for one second. Oh, it's a biopic and you are Bill Gates.
0:39:13.840000 - 0:39:20.080000::You play Bill Gates and it's super dramatic, super sexy. They're all the death and the killings
0:39:20.080000 - 0:39:26.560000::that Bill Gates ordered is finally exposed in the movie committed personally. And but it comes
0:39:26.560000 - 0:39:30.880000::at the end that he is a really good guy and he's sitting front row. All right.
0:39:32.720000 - 0:39:37.760000::Who? Oh, but also I want to say this. He's about to die. He's been diagnosed with an
0:39:37.760000 - 0:39:43.600000::incurable disease. And this is probably his last year on earth. Me or Bill Gates and who am I?
0:39:43.600000 - 0:39:48.240000::Bill Gates is in attendance watching you accept the you played him in the movie. He's really there.
0:39:48.240000 - 0:39:52.080000::But he's watching me. Yeah, he's really there. All right.
0:39:54.720000 - 0:39:59.120000::So they say the award for best actor goes to

0:41:27.280000 - 0:41:29.920000::In the first ever movie that almost everybody in this room was in
0:41:30.960000 - 0:41:36.960000::So we all can celebrate to collectively in this victory and with Bill Gates staring at me
0:41:37.760000 - 0:41:42.800000::Knowing that he's about to go out getting to see his name up in lights like this giving him this favor
0:41:42.880000 - 0:41:44.400000::I can only hope someone does this for me one day
0:41:45.280000 - 0:41:48.480000::And Bill Gates I know that you've been working on killing mosquitoes, right?
0:41:49.200000 - 0:41:51::Well guess what I
0:41:51 - 0:41:55.120000::Brought in a mosquito today and I'm gonna cut its fucking head off for you brother
0:41:55.680000 - 0:41:57.520000::And then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take a fucking saw
0:41:58.880000 - 0:42:04.640000::And while Bill Gates kind of takes his last breaths. I'm gonna get the biggest mosquito I can and I'm right in front of him
0:42:04.640000 - 0:42:10.560000::I'm everybody's trying and then like and then right when I'm about to take the saw to the neck of this mosquito Bill Gates goes
0:42:11.360000 - 0:42:13.360000::Don't do it
0:42:13.360000 - 0:42:15.360000::You know, he's got less of a voice at that point he goes
0:42:18.240000 - 0:42:23.280000::I go what and Bill Gates takes the mic synny goes I was wrong about mosquitoes
0:42:24.640000 - 0:42:27.200000::They need blood just like we do
0:42:27.920000 - 0:42:28.720000::Oh my god
0:42:28.720000 - 0:42:32::Instead of killing these mosquitoes and creating a net
0:42:32.880000 - 0:42:36.080000::We need to learn from mosquitoes and humans to co-live together
0:42:36.400000 - 0:42:39.840000::co-habitively and then at that point I would say
0:42:41.200000 - 0:42:48.160000::Nice nice and then I'd let the mosquito run free and the mosquito would go suck on every single celebrity's blood
0:42:48.480000 - 0:42:54.240000::And then pop up blood into a little dish that we keep as a sample so that we can keep having lit actors
0:42:54.480000 - 0:43:00.480000::But then all the actors get what's now they die and then it's a good thing because we it's about time we get a new
0:43:01.040000 - 0:43:04.080000::New crop a new fresh batch of celebrities, right? That would be wow
0:43:04.160000 - 0:43:09.520000::All the it'll not that we'd ever do this but taking out all the hellisters to get the new actors in their or give
0:43:10 - 0:43:12::Wash-debactors a new shot
0:43:12.240000 - 0:43:14.240000::And a couple need to go
0:43:15.280000 - 0:43:22.640000::Can I say an observation I have that was amazing jack but an observation I have is each one of our speeches contained a
0:43:23.120000 - 0:43:25.120000::form of violence
0:43:25.840000 - 0:43:31.840000::Oops, and I was decrying a violence earlier in media and video games and what I noticed is
0:43:32.720000 - 0:43:35.520000::We somehow have this violence within ourselves
0:43:36.320000 - 0:43:40.320000::This predilection predilection for violence and I'm like
0:43:41.440000 - 0:43:50.080000::Is that really who we want to be as adult males or is violent males you you want us to I don't want to be that not violent and people
0:43:50.480000 - 0:43:56::You know, we need to be reminded that we're actually which I think this might be shocking to you guys
0:43:56.080000 - 0:43:58.080000::But we're actually role models
0:43:58.640000 - 0:44:02.480000::For a lot of do now. I mean I surprise myself every day when I remember that
0:44:04 - 0:44:06::And we have sort of a
0:44:06.400000 - 0:44:12.720000::Responsibility to give them a version the best version of what they can be and show them kind of the way
0:44:12.720000 - 0:44:16.560000::Which is a lot of pressure on us, but this is kind of the responsibility that we've
0:44:17.600000 - 0:44:22.160000::You know we gladly accept as entertainers artists multi-hyphenets
0:44:23.120000 - 0:44:28::Is that you guys do look to us for what you should be like and we
0:44:28.240000 - 0:44:32.640000::Just want to I just want to say I think collectively I can speak for you guys. We want to apologize
0:44:33.280000 - 0:44:34.800000::right now
0:44:34.800000 - 0:44:36.800000::for some of the violent type
0:44:37.600000 - 0:44:39.600000::Shit that we've been talking about
0:44:39.760000 - 0:44:44.720000::thus far and no more of that there's a lot of changes that are going to be happening
0:44:45.200000 - 0:44:49.760000::This is a joy. This is a joy tactics of the podcast and I think we got a little off thing
0:44:50.320000 - 0:44:52.320000::Yeah, and we're not coming
0:44:52.880000 - 0:44:56.480000::Let me revise one really really quick to make it listen to this
0:44:56.480000 - 0:45:00::I win right for playing a father or singing

0:45:00 - 0:45:05.540000::father in a movie. I've always wanted to play that. And they give the award to me
0:45:05.540000 - 0:45:10.260000::because I was best actor wherever I was voted. Everybody agreed. The kid who plays
0:45:10.260000 - 0:45:14.080000::my son's only six years old and he's an ugly child. That's what I got
0:45:14.080000 - 0:45:17.460000::of course about being a single father. They're still like a really ugly kid.
0:45:17.460000 - 0:45:23.280000::Ugly child. That's the law. Ugly duckling. Right. And what they announced it
0:45:23.280000 - 0:45:28.180000::everybody's expected me to walk up. I go up to the child that played my son in
0:45:28.180000 - 0:45:31.880000::the movie. And I put I take his head and I put it next to mine and I put our
0:45:31.880000 - 0:45:36.800000::head together. And I said I whisper something to him. And he gets a small crooked
0:45:36.800000 - 0:45:42.360000::smile with his birthday fucked up teeth smile across all his face. And I sit back
0:45:42.360000 - 0:45:47.960000::down everybody's going what the fuck is happening? This kid waddles up to the
0:45:47.960000 - 0:45:54::stage. And he says well, you know, like, yeah, we said, you know, Mr.
0:45:54 - 0:45:59.740000::Rehal said that I should give the speech. And the kid gets these award going
0:45:59.740000 - 0:46:04.160000::back to my love for child actors and how much I think they're so sober. Give
0:46:04.160000 - 0:46:07.060000::the world a word. Wait, don't become the center of attention. Do something nice.
0:46:07.060000 - 0:46:11.460000::That's what I that's what I would do. That's my revision. That is so credible.
0:46:11.460000 - 0:46:16.660000::Just want to I just want to share that with you guys. Thank you, man. Thank you
0:46:16.660000 - 0:46:20.360000::for sharing man. I'm gonna stick with man. I'm gonna stick with mine. No, I
0:46:20.360000 - 0:46:23.720000::was right. I was all right. Because I feel like I've tried to kill the
0:46:23.720000 - 0:46:28.360000::miss I was going to kill the mosquito. Oh, but you didn't happen is I didn't. And
0:46:28.360000 - 0:46:32.400000::then it was an accident that all the celebrities died. It wasn't a violent
0:46:32.400000 - 0:46:37.820000::thing. It was a net net. No, the circle of life. Death is not to be is not
0:46:37.820000 - 0:46:43.320000::something terrible. It's just something part of that happens. Should we go
0:46:43.320000 - 0:46:46.760000::through Duma really quick and see what the fuck's happening on Duma right now?
0:46:46.760000 - 0:46:52.460000::Yeah, I think people I think that's more. This is the only account that I
0:46:52.460000 - 0:46:57.680000::follow personally and keep up. I love you. Don't know. If you don't know what it is
0:46:57.680000 - 0:47:01.720000::it's a I guess it's more than an Instagram account, but that's what I follow it.
0:47:01.720000 - 0:47:06.960000::It's an account where they people give anonymous celebrity gossip. So if you
0:47:06.960000 - 0:47:13.560000::see you know William DeFoe out at lunch and he is making out with some crazy
0:47:13.680000 - 0:47:19.040000::model DM day. And they'll post it and you can kind of keep tabs on these
0:47:19.040000 - 0:47:24.280000::celebrities in their lifestyles and they think that they're safe, but oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, it's basically a
0:47:24.280000 - 0:47:30.240000::chance. It's a chance for everybody in the in the world to be Julian Assange
0:47:30.240000 - 0:47:34.320000::without having penalty because they can't lock us all up for holding people
0:47:34.320000 - 0:47:40.040000::accountable and speaking truth to Instagram in this way. So why don't we you know, I
0:47:40.880000 - 0:47:46.080000::guess these are not submitted by us. So you can't come after us for this. But
0:47:46.920000 - 0:47:51.240000::So let's I mean, I got a little bit of tea right right as here. Wait, what's
0:47:51.240000 - 0:47:57.760000::do I mean? No one? Nobody knows. I mean, nobody's three. That's some type of
0:47:57.760000 - 0:48:03.280000::French. All right, well, listen to this. This is insider information submitted
0:48:03.400000 - 0:48:09.320000::and honestly, anonymously it says it's Justin Bieber and bad bunny song coming,
0:48:09.760000 - 0:48:14.760000::trying to get the song of the summer again. So that means somebody knows that
0:48:14.760000 - 0:48:20.680000::Mr. Justin and Mr. Bad Bunny are working on a brand new ass track. I knew they
0:48:20.680000 - 0:48:28.760000::shit. They were. Oh my God. Yes. Yes. I can't wait to do it. When I can't wait for
0:48:28.760000 - 0:48:33.160000::the day that I'm in a Uber or a grocery store, a Dunkin Donuts, and I hear this
0:48:33.160000 - 0:48:39.280000::shit tickling my ear. It makes me want to make your booty makes me a la la actually

0:49:02.680000 - 0:49:08.160000::he doesn't have artistic integrity. Oh, no, no, no, have you heard young man? These
0:49:08.160000 - 0:49:12.040000::people are so sad. They think that like, oh, I want to be born in the 60s. I want to

0:52:21.480000 - 0:52:27.320000::It's like are you taking the project that seriously? Oh, you think that she's dispatching your personal chef by eating out of the restaurant
0:52:27.920000 - 0:52:30::Well, if you have I just think that you you know
0:52:30 - 0:52:33.160000::You have a role coming up and you can't just be eating any oil you have to well

0:53:04 - 0:53:06::Crazy like 20% the end of the day
0:53:06 - 0:53:08.640000::For even though you ordered like Fennichini Alfredo
0:53:09.320000 - 0:53:12::You steam everything Eric only eat steamed food
0:53:12 - 0:53:14::Oh
0:53:14 - 0:53:16::I've been worried lately about
0:53:16.240000 - 0:53:22.120000::Microwave because I got this rice that you can microwave from Wegmans and I'm like if you microwave
0:53:22.120000 - 0:53:24.120000::Plastic is the plastic
0:53:24.920000 - 0:53:29.840000::Getting all into the food. Yes, it depends on the plastic. Yeah, you're done Eric
0:53:29.840000 - 0:53:32.400000::We already know you were fucked. We're just fucked
0:53:32.400000 - 0:53:37.520000::There's nothing we can do about this contamination in our food and we just ask the why does it have to be about the cancers?
0:53:37.520000 - 0:53:41.480000::I'm I'm so sick of people thinking that they can go through life in consequentially
0:53:42.280000 - 0:53:46.400000::Death is natural and if you're gonna worry. Oh, is this doing this is it doing this?
0:53:46.400000 - 0:53:49.960000::Guess what everybody dies through their mouth not to bring it back to phrases
0:53:49.960000 - 0:53:55.720000::But that's just how it goes and if you want it to be faster slower this way that way you don't get to choose
0:53:55.720000 - 0:54:01.720000::That's not for you to decide I'm sick of people hating on cups hating on bath tubs. Hey, what are you guys just hating on?
0:54:02.200000 - 0:54:05.560000::Oh plastic containers for food. Oh plastic containers
0:54:06.040000 - 0:54:09.240000::We should be so grateful for plastic microwaves. No, no
0:54:09.240000 - 0:54:15.240000::I mean the minute you start singing plastic praises is the minute you start worshipping literally the
0:54:15.440000 - 0:54:22.120000::Antichrist the devil that is signaling the end of our world plastic was the death nail for our planet
0:54:22.120000 - 0:54:26.560000::There's no getting away look around you right now, man look around you. What's on your head?
0:54:26.560000 - 0:54:28.560000::What's that little upside down you
0:54:28.560000 - 0:54:34.520000::Hot metal no on top of that that's not metal. That's plastic look around you
0:54:34.520000 - 0:54:37.200000::These are the funny little glasses metal plastic
0:54:37.680000 - 0:54:39.680000::Yeah, you have
0:54:39.680000 - 0:54:43.040000::Look at this what's your keyboard made out of a rubber rubber?
0:54:43.680000 - 0:54:49.640000::Rubber is plastic. I'm on a straws metal. Metal's hard plastic. What's clay?
0:54:49.960000 - 0:54:56.440000::I'm my computer you can't see it, but I'm on a totally organic area more dry plastic
0:54:57.160000 - 0:54:59.560000::What is technically plastic it depends

0:55:00 - 0:55:02.560000::Well, we're talking about death right now.
0:55:02.560000 - 0:55:09.220000::And this is gonna shock you guys, but I just saw an interview with a scientist and they
0:55:09.220000 - 0:55:11.520000::have blinded some mice.
0:55:11.520000 - 0:55:14.120000::Yes, haha, like the children's.
0:55:14.120000 - 0:55:15.520000::Not funny.
0:55:15.520000 - 0:55:16.520000::Not funny.
0:55:16.520000 - 0:55:17.520000::Not funny.
0:55:17.520000 - 0:55:21.440000::They have blinded these fucking mice and they did it without remorse because their test
0:55:21.440000 - 0:55:23.440000::laser in the lab.
0:55:23.440000 - 0:55:24.440000::And guess what?
0:55:24.440000 - 0:55:25.440000::What?
0:55:25.440000 - 0:55:28.320000::They have reversed their blindness.
0:55:28.320000 - 0:55:29.320000::Yes, what?
0:55:29.320000 - 0:55:32.080000::Through technology that we're developing.
0:55:32.080000 - 0:55:33.680000::Mr. Beast reversed blindness.
0:55:33.680000 - 0:55:36.840000::Oh my.
0:55:36.840000 - 0:55:37.840000::And guess what?
0:55:37.840000 - 0:55:42.880000::They're about to put this technology into clinical trials on...
0:55:42.880000 - 0:55:43.880000::Be careful.
0:55:43.880000 - 0:55:47.120000::...primates and then humans very soon.
0:55:47.120000 - 0:55:49.040000::Oh, leave the age out of it.
0:55:49.040000 - 0:55:50.040000::Yes, what?
0:55:50.040000 - 0:55:58.240000::The technology to reverse the aging of your skin, of your muscles, of your organs,
0:55:58.240000 - 0:56:01.600000::exist currently in our reality.
0:56:01.600000 - 0:56:06.960000::We just have to go through all these loops and I'm saying enough with the loops of testing
0:56:06.960000 - 0:56:07.960000::it out.
0:56:07.960000 - 0:56:11.920000::Let's just put this shit on the market and just see what happens.
0:56:11.920000 - 0:56:17.840000::You want me to do operation warp speed on experimental reverse skin aging.
0:56:17.840000 - 0:56:19.560000::Enough with the testing.
0:56:19.560000 - 0:56:21.440000::We need to save the...
0:56:21.440000 - 0:56:22.640000::We're done with this shit.
0:56:22.640000 - 0:56:24.960000::I think I can just trust these scientists now.
0:56:24.960000 - 0:56:27.920000::They've proven themselves over the last 100 years.
0:56:27.920000 - 0:56:31.040000::We don't need these regulations on them and these lab testings.
0:56:31.040000 - 0:56:34.680000::I think we just need to let these scientists cook and come up with some crazy shit and
0:56:34.680000 - 0:56:37.440000::see what happens.
0:56:37.440000 - 0:56:38.440000::That's a good point.
0:56:38.440000 - 0:56:41.440000::That's how much I love science, by the way.
0:56:41.440000 - 0:56:42.440000::Well you should have certain...
0:56:42.440000 - 0:56:47.440000::Like if you're a new science, if you've never had one of your pills approved, then sure
0:56:47.440000 - 0:56:48.440000::you got to go through.
0:56:48.440000 - 0:56:54.400000::But once you've been through the ringer a couple times, let them cook if you made Adderall.
0:56:54.400000 - 0:56:57.240000::You don't need to reapply for the second drug.
0:56:57.240000 - 0:56:58.240000::Right, right.
0:56:58.240000 - 0:57:04::If you've proven yourself on making one crazy ass, like Zoloft, whoever made Zoloft
0:57:04 - 0:57:10.040000::or something like that, they just get a free pass to just make whatever type of crazy
0:57:10.040000 - 0:57:14.080000::ass fucking drug and it's on the shelf immediately.
0:57:14.080000 - 0:57:17.360000::And why can't drugs be in a food instead of a fucking pill?
0:57:17.360000 - 0:57:23.080000::If there was a brand of whatever frozen waffles that helped with anxiety medically, and I don't
0:57:23.080000 - 0:57:26.640000::want a prescription either, by the way, what is the prescription?
0:57:26.640000 - 0:57:30.320000::It doesn't make any sense because it's like, okay, you can only have this if you send
0:57:30.320000 - 0:57:33.640000::an email and it's all just...
0:57:33.640000 - 0:57:35.040000::There's so much corruption within the world.
0:57:35.040000 - 0:57:36.040000::It's kind of like...
0:57:36.040000 - 0:57:37.040000::Why don't we be a change?
0:57:37.040000 - 0:57:38.720000::Why don't we get a learn?
0:57:38.720000 - 0:57:40.760000::Why don't people have to be so mean?
0:57:40.760000 - 0:57:42.560000::It's just as enough is enough.
0:57:42.560000 - 0:57:51.120000::The childish Gambino is spotted having a lunch at Osterio Mosa.
0:57:51.120000 - 0:57:54.360000::So this is not Donald Glover, but childish Gambino.
0:57:54.360000 - 0:58:00.200000::So he was kind of in his wrapper swag going to this...
0:58:00.200000 - 0:58:03.200000::What I love about this is the Italian restaurant.
0:58:03.200000 - 0:58:05.240000::The celebrities are just like us.
0:58:05.240000 - 0:58:09.320000::You could literally go to that restaurant and have it exactly with the ad.
0:58:09.320000 - 0:58:14.200000::And then maybe that inspires you like, oh, if he could make the rap and be in all the
0:58:14.200000 - 0:58:18.160000::movies and on TV, maybe I could do that too.
0:58:18.160000 - 0:58:19.880000::You see what I mean.
0:58:19.880000 - 0:58:25.320000::So people are saying, do mom paparazzi suck for exposing these people's lives, but maybe
0:58:25.320000 - 0:58:29.800000::they're just opening up the opportunities for the rest of us.
0:58:29.800000 - 0:58:30.800000::You know what I mean?
0:58:30.800000 - 0:58:35.520000::And it's like, that's your job as you're like a modern superhero.
0:58:35.520000 - 0:58:38.920000::Like how good is it going to feel if you see...
0:58:38.920000 - 0:58:39.920000::Basically, Superman.
0:58:39.920000 - 0:58:41.920000::You see Shaila Buff.
0:58:41.920000 - 0:58:42.920000::You see...
0:58:42.920000 - 0:58:46.320000::I can't think...
0:58:46.320000 - 0:58:47.920000::Somebody penalty crews.
0:58:48.640000 - 0:58:52.440000::And they're out living their lives leading by example.
0:58:52.440000 - 0:58:55.360000::You're going to feel like thank God.
0:58:55.360000 - 0:58:57.560000::Your job is not really to be in movies.
0:58:57.560000 - 0:58:59.240000::It's not really to be acting.
0:58:59.240000 - 0:59:00.760000::It's not really to be some...
0:59:00.760000 - 0:59:01.760000::Whatever.
0:59:01.760000 - 0:59:02.760000::It's not really to be podcasters.
0:59:02.760000 - 0:59:06::What we're really doing is we...
0:59:06 - 0:59:11::And it's leading by examples going to Oistero, Moses Oistero, whatever the restaurant is.
0:59:11 - 0:59:14.560000::It's showing people that it's okay to let loose.
0:59:14.560000 - 0:59:15.560000::It's okay to have fun.
0:59:15.560000 - 0:59:17.040000::I know we got an election coming up.
0:59:17.040000 - 0:59:18.040000::I know.
0:59:18.040000 - 0:59:22.520000::You lose friends and family members are dropping left and right the older you get.
0:59:22.520000 - 0:59:24.880000::But keep on keeping on.
0:59:24.880000 - 0:59:27.520000::Go get a oyster.
0:59:27.520000 - 0:59:28.840000::And you mentioned election season.
0:59:28.840000 - 0:59:31.360000::I cannot wait for that fucking time to come around.
0:59:31.360000 - 0:59:36.280000::Because every time election season comes around, I'm fucking off my ass getting drunk every
0:59:36.280000 - 0:59:42.400000::night pouring the wine up to the top of the cup, like sitting down for a few seconds.
0:59:42.400000 - 0:59:44.280000::Well, let's make some predictions.
0:59:44.280000 - 0:59:46.240000::Eric, I want to hear what you think.
0:59:46.240000 - 0:59:49::As you know, I know Kat's on the back at this point.
0:59:49 - 0:59:52.280000::Donald Trump seems to be really making a push.
0:59:52.280000 - 0:59:53.280000::He was at CPAC.
0:59:53.280000 - 0:59:54.280000::Yeah.
0:59:54.280000 - 0:59:55.280000::Junior was there.
0:59:55.280000 - 0:59:56.280000::We don't know what Biden is.
0:59:56.280000 - 0:59:57.280000::Is Biden going to run again?
0:59:57.280000 - 0:59:58.280000::We're not so sure.
0:59:58.280000 - 0:59:59.280000::Is Kamil going to be on the ticket?

1:00:00 - 1:00:01.120000::Where's your head at?
1:00:01.120000 - 1:00:03.560000::Well, I just want to, it's such a crazy landscape right now.
1:00:03.560000 - 1:00:06.160000::And if you're not paying attention like you're missing out right now
1:00:06.160000 - 1:00:10::on so many amazing things that are happening right from our eyes,
1:00:10 - 1:00:12.840000::we have all these new players, Ron DeSantis,
1:00:12.840000 - 1:00:16.120000::Meatball Ron, doing it's Meatball Ron.
1:00:16.120000 - 1:00:17.640000::And so many others.
1:00:17.640000 - 1:00:22::And I don't want to comment because I almost don't want to jinx it.
1:00:22 - 1:00:25.960000::But I do think that we could have another Democratic win
1:00:25.960000 - 1:00:27.440000::in the next election.
1:00:27.440000 - 1:00:30.080000::That would just be so amazing.
1:00:30.080000 - 1:00:31.680000::Yeah.
1:00:31.680000 - 1:00:33.600000::Nate, it's so funny that you got,
1:00:33.600000 - 1:00:38.840000::well, how on the hell did you guys just say this into that you just said
1:00:38.840000 - 1:00:42.560000::without even mentioning Mr. Joe Biden?
1:00:42.560000 - 1:00:46.840000::Because it's not even going to be in my opinion this next race.
1:00:46.840000 - 1:00:48.680000::We might as well not even have it.
1:00:48.680000 - 1:00:52.560000::Because Biden just started getting cooking just now.
1:00:52.560000 - 1:00:56.480000::And everybody in the country is feeling that he his power
1:00:56.480000 - 1:01:01.640000::and his, his just grip over our entire reality
1:01:01.640000 - 1:01:06.040000::and how he's just got our backs like no other fucking politician has in the planet.
1:01:06.040000 - 1:01:09.240000::And I think that they're going to fucking etch out another fucking,
1:01:09.240000 - 1:01:14.560000::the fucking head statue on Mount Rushmore for his ass.
1:01:14.560000 - 1:01:17.120000::Because he's about to go down as a legendary president,
1:01:17.120000 - 1:01:21.040000::president, and he is not going to be ever forgotten.
1:01:21.040000 - 1:01:23.720000::And Mr. Biden with you.
1:01:23.720000 - 1:01:25.240000::Don't disagree.
1:01:25.240000 - 1:01:26.520000::All this shit that you're doing.
1:01:26.520000 - 1:01:29.600000::And I think that you guys need to give a little bit more respect to this man.
1:01:29.600000 - 1:01:30.360000::Because guess what?
1:01:30.360000 - 1:01:31.200000::He is your president.
1:01:31.200000 - 1:01:31.720000::And guess what?
1:01:31.720000 - 1:01:32.480000::You voted for him.
1:01:32.480000 - 1:01:33.680000::Didn't you?
1:01:33.680000 - 1:01:36.960000::Well, it's funny because people think what's his legacy going to be?
1:01:36.960000 - 1:01:38.320000::Oh, he's all right.
1:01:38.320000 - 1:01:39.120000::What's his legacy?
1:01:39.120000 - 1:01:40.120000::Yeah.
1:01:40.120000 - 1:01:41.120000::What?
1:01:41.120000 - 1:01:42.120000::You don't vote?
1:01:42.120000 - 1:01:43.840000::No, I voted for his ass multiple.
1:01:43.840000 - 1:01:45.320000::You better vote.
1:01:45.320000 - 1:01:46.320000::You don't want to see my.
1:01:46.320000 - 1:01:47.320000::I got multiple.
1:01:47.320000 - 1:01:49.360000::I'll just say that my entire, my bet, my bet, my bet, my bet,
1:01:49.360000 - 1:01:51.600000::my bet, my bet, my bet, my bet, my bet, my bet.
1:01:51.600000 - 1:01:53.280000::Well, that's illegal.
1:01:53.280000 - 1:01:54.280000::That's illegal.
1:01:54.280000 - 1:01:55.200000::Don't joke about that.
1:01:55.200000 - 1:02:01.160000::We have a responsibility of a journalistic integrity right here.
1:02:01.160000 - 1:02:06.120000::But I'll just say my bathroom tile basically, all my tiles are covered in I voted stickers
1:02:06.120000 - 1:02:07.120000::because I'm such a vote.
1:02:07.120000 - 1:02:08.120000::I'm the vote goat.
1:02:08.120000 - 1:02:11.360000::You know how somebody else has been called something like that?
1:02:11.360000 - 1:02:12.920000::I'm the vote goat goat.
1:02:12.920000 - 1:02:13.920000::I vote in everything.
1:02:13.920000 - 1:02:19::All right, wait, maybe I think it's about time on the vote goat to wrap it up.
1:02:19 - 1:02:25.200000::Call it we just kind of crushed it for an hour plus and we did it again and
1:02:26.080000 - 1:02:30.460000::I guess we could say what we're thankful what we're joyful for this week this week
1:02:31.520000 - 1:02:33.520000::I'll kick it off
1:02:34.680000 - 1:02:40.080000::I'm joyful for the shame I felt for myself eating all that talk about being being pathetic
1:02:40.440000 - 1:02:43.360000::Because without the shame I wouldn't be motivated to change
1:02:44.640000 - 1:02:46.640000::What will be the rest of my life?
1:02:46.640000 - 1:02:52.520000::So thank you Taco Bell for filling me with all that fucking rap poison and let's keep it going

1:04:02.160000 - 1:04:08.560000::Was bringing so much joy brought so much joy to me the different experiences when you bump when you get an elevator
1:04:09.080000 - 1:04:11.080000::There you are for 30 seconds
1:04:11.520000 - 1:04:19.280000::Truly experiencing what somebody else is and I got a video of two guys wrestling the fuck out of each other drunk as hell in the elevator making me push the buttons
1:04:21.160000 - 1:04:22.680000::Really
1:04:22.680000 - 1:04:28.720000::It's a beautiful glimpse into other people's lives and I would watch a feature film that was a bunch of somebody getting on much elevators
