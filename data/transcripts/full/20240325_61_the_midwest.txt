0:00:14.400000 - 0:00:20.400000::Well I'll be lying if I said it was a pleasure working with the fools in bastards.
0:00:21.920000 - 0:00:24.960000::But you gotta spend your life one way or another.
0:00:25.920000 - 0:00:30.080000::I guess it's time for me to jump into the sea.

0:00:57.600000 - 0:01:02.560000::This is what I'm holding right now is a candy that was purchased in the basically
0:01:03.280000 - 0:01:06.880000::convenient store in the Marina Towers, the Wilco Towers here in Chicago.
0:01:07.760000 - 0:01:13.440000::And this to me is a type of candy they're called backcountry road old-fashioned strawberry twists.
0:01:13.440000 - 0:01:14.320000::You ever had these night?
0:01:16.320000 - 0:01:18.080000::I mean I've had twizzlers but I have to have those.
0:01:18.080000 - 0:01:18.800000::This is what twist.
0:01:18.800000 - 0:01:20.160000::No one's had that.
0:01:20.160000 - 0:01:24.320000::No but they've had them in the Midwest which is where they're from.
0:01:24.320000 - 0:01:26.720000::Yeah, well these are made in our station candy.
0:01:26.720000 - 0:01:30.240000::Well, it kind of could be but this gives me Midwest vibes.
0:01:31.280000 - 0:01:36.640000::There's something preserved about those like there's something in the Midwest where it's like
0:01:36.640000 - 0:01:41.600000::local businesses like this can thrive in a way where on the East Coast you're either twizzlers
0:01:41.600000 - 0:01:43.520000::or you're out of there man.
0:01:43.520000 - 0:01:48.480000::You ain't getting a gas slot at the gas station or at the bodega unless you're a big big name.
0:01:50.400000 - 0:01:51.200000::In the West Coast.
0:01:51.200000 - 0:01:53.360000::Yeah, we're talking about the Midwest right now.
0:01:53.360000 - 0:01:59.200000::Yeah, if you can guess right that's the topic of the episode if you can guess by now.
0:02:00.240000 - 0:02:05.760000::Well, about a year ago me jack and Nate, almost exactly a year ago we were all here.
0:02:06.080000 - 0:02:07.360000::And I'm in the same sweater.
0:02:08 - 0:02:12.400000::I'm in the same outfit as I was one year ago doing a podcast back in this apartment.
0:02:12.400000 - 0:02:14.400000::Yeah, and I look very different don't I?
0:02:14.400000 - 0:02:15.680000::Full body transformation.
0:02:15.680000 - 0:02:18.400000::I didn't even put that together you're in the apartment.
0:02:18.480000 - 0:02:20.400000::Yeah, wow.
0:02:20.400000 - 0:02:21.680000::Incredible.
0:02:21.680000 - 0:02:22.480000::Legendary.
0:02:23.440000 - 0:02:24.560000::So let's break it down.
0:02:24.560000 - 0:02:27.520000::Let's wait no longer because the class is in session.
0:02:27.520000 - 0:02:30.880000::So the Midwest, why did they call it that?
0:02:31.520000 - 0:02:33.120000::That is so interesting to me.
0:02:33.120000 - 0:02:34.960000::The Midwest.
0:02:35.520000 - 0:02:39.200000::So back when it was a first originally named they were going out west.
0:02:39.200000 - 0:02:40.160000::I would imagine.
0:02:40.160000 - 0:02:44.080000::And then they said, well, the West is all that that this is about midway to the West.
0:02:44.080000 - 0:02:45.200000::That's what I would concur.
0:02:45.600000 - 0:02:47.600000::Right.
0:02:47.600000 - 0:02:50.880000::I mean, at one point it was the West, you know, it wasn't even mid.
0:02:51.840000 - 0:02:52.640000::You know what I'm saying?
0:02:53.600000 - 0:02:54.800000::And let's just be clear.
0:02:54.800000 - 0:02:56.160000::There's nothing made about it.
0:02:56.720000 - 0:02:57.680000::Very good.
0:02:57.680000 - 0:02:58.880000::Very good.
0:02:58.880000 - 0:03:03.760000::This is just as important almost as important as every other part of the country,
0:03:03.760000 - 0:03:05.680000::especially the parts that hit the oceans.
0:03:05.680000 - 0:03:07.680000::Everybody says the oceans is where you need to be.
0:03:08.400000 - 0:03:10.240000::Well, tell that to the hurt.
0:03:10.240000 - 0:03:11.040000::Tell the nominees.
0:03:11.040000 - 0:03:11.680000::Yeah, right.
0:03:11.680000 - 0:03:14.880000::Tell that to the people getting flooded by tsunamis and hurricanes and have to deal with
0:03:14.880000 - 0:03:18.960000::what sperm whales and violent creatures from the deep.
0:03:18.960000 - 0:03:23.280000::There's nothing like that going to get you in Gary, Indiana.
0:03:23.280000 - 0:03:26.800000::The only thing that's going to get you in Gary and Anna's drug addiction.
0:03:26.800000 - 0:03:28.080000::Well, poverty.
0:03:28.080000 - 0:03:30.160000::But it's all internal things that you can manage.
0:03:30.160000 - 0:03:33.200000::And you already manage it just by listening to this.
0:03:33.200000 - 0:03:34.720000::Let's give it up for Lori, life.
0:03:36.400000 - 0:03:37.200000::Is she out?
0:03:37.200000 - 0:03:38.160000::I'll kind of ride.
0:03:38.160000 - 0:03:38.480000::Huh?

0:03:39.920000 - 0:03:45.360000::But we remember fondly for what is she doing now like on a day-to-day basis?
0:03:45.360000 - 0:03:46.880000::Like is she having jobs?
0:03:46.880000 - 0:03:49.040000::She's designing a 2D video game.
0:03:51.440000 - 0:03:52.960000::Yeah, she's doing CrossFit now.
0:03:52.960000 - 0:03:54.960000::She has time for the stuff that she really likes to do.
0:03:56.080000 - 0:03:58.080000::And we're having me and Eric are having to share the mic.
0:03:58.800000 - 0:03:59.360000::I know.

0:04:58.640000 - 0:04:59.840000::It might be wrong to think that...

0:10:10.640000 - 0:10:14.640000::get and take a picture of the people in New cities.
0:10:14.640000 - 0:10:18.200000::And yeah, in the East Coast, they call your ass out.
0:10:18.200000 - 0:10:24.200000::Now, the thing is, people are surface level more kind
0:10:24.200000 - 0:10:29.320000::out here, kind of, in the Midwest.
0:10:29.320000 - 0:10:33.440000::And the Northeast, yeah, they do give the East Coast a bad name.
0:10:33.440000 - 0:10:37.240000::But if you go to the southeast, if you go to the South.
0:10:37.240000 - 0:10:39.600000::These are people who leave us.
0:10:39.600000 - 0:10:41.440000::Listen, if you're stuck on the side of the road
0:10:41.440000 - 0:10:45.480000::and your car's broken down, in the middle of nowhere in Virginia,
0:10:45.480000 - 0:10:49.520000::they will pull over and they will help you just to see what's going on.
0:10:49.520000 - 0:10:53.080000::By the way, when I say Chicago, I mean the Northeast.
0:10:53.080000 - 0:10:55.400000::The South is a different whole fucking thing.
0:10:55.400000 - 0:10:56.800000::They're not a part of the East Coast.
0:10:56.800000 - 0:10:57.880000::All right, I think we need to.
0:10:57.880000 - 0:11:02.560000::People are really evil, you know, where people really don't know
0:11:02.560000 - 0:11:08.040000::how to talk or act around one another, Northwest.
0:11:08.040000 - 0:11:10.040000::Where I'm born and raised.
0:11:10.040000 - 0:11:13.800000::They don't know how to, I go there and feel like I've done something very wrong
0:11:13.800000 - 0:11:17.640000::or a family member of mine is wrong, them, or even myself.
0:11:17.640000 - 0:11:21.320000::As it turns out, they just don't know how to make eye contact.
0:11:21.320000 - 0:11:22.320000::Well, you know what?
0:11:22.320000 - 0:11:26.040000::I'm so good at talking to strangers, it's disturbing.
0:11:26.040000 - 0:11:28::I'm not a talk to strangers, but then I know how to talk to them.
0:11:28 - 0:11:31.440000::Especially if they're political activists as well.
0:11:31.440000 - 0:11:34.920000::Oh, if you're a political activist, if you see Eric Reihl walking down the street
0:11:34.920000 - 0:11:39.480000::in your Greenpeace email collector, you better get ready for the longest conversation
0:11:39.480000 - 0:11:41.560000::of your life and the biggest donation.
0:11:41.560000 - 0:11:44.360000::And if it puts that white kiss on the neck.
0:11:44.360000 - 0:11:49.200000::All of his different emails on there and he'll get you like to your goal for the hour.
0:11:49.200000 - 0:11:52.640000::Yeah, volunteer, big white and legal envelope full of ones.
0:11:52.640000 - 0:11:55.440000::Eric Reihl and one hundred ones at gmail.com.
0:11:56.040000 - 0:11:59.440000::Eric Reihl actor at Yahoo.
0:11:59.440000 - 0:12:03.880000::This is kind of get me in the game is, is lean, my leg was falling asleep, so I have to stand
0:12:03.880000 - 0:12:06.360000::up like this, but is your booty out?
0:12:06.360000 - 0:12:08.280000::I can't see it through the zoom, but is your ass?
0:12:08.280000 - 0:12:10.440000::Are you like leaning over like that?
0:12:10.440000 - 0:12:11.440000::I can't really see.
0:12:11.440000 - 0:12:13.760000::Yeah, the booties, the booties out for sure.
0:12:13.760000 - 0:12:14.760000::We're arching right now.
0:12:14.760000 - 0:12:15.760000::For sure.
0:12:15.760000 - 0:12:20.480000::Oh, and I showed this to Nate off, but we all know this is by now because I showed it
0:12:20.480000 - 0:12:24.760000::before the pod, but we got a little something called morning recovery.
0:12:24.760000 - 0:12:25.960000::Those things work, dude.
0:12:25.960000 - 0:12:30.360000::I know Jack was doubting it, but and you know, they do have even two beers.
0:12:30.360000 - 0:12:31.640000::You want one of these?
0:12:31.640000 - 0:12:32.640000::They work drink it.
0:12:32.640000 - 0:12:36.320000::You have to drink it within what and a half an hour of your last drink, right?
0:12:36.320000 - 0:12:37.320000::Yeah, yeah.
0:12:37.320000 - 0:12:40.560000::So I'm putting this in my and you know what the extra key is.
0:12:40.560000 - 0:12:44.560000::If you really are going hard tonight, Eric, which I know you are going to, I won't,
0:12:44.560000 - 0:12:45.560000::I won't.
0:12:45.560000 - 0:12:46.560000::I know you are.
0:12:46.560000 - 0:12:51.280000::Despite every time you say that, it's, it's the your actions show differently.
0:12:51.280000 - 0:12:56.380000::So before the show, I want you to get one of them electrolyte packets and then you got
0:12:56.380000 - 0:12:58.920000::to drink, you got to drink electrolytes before you drink.
0:12:58.920000 - 0:13:04.720000::Okay, it's not just about the after electrolytes is just salt.
0:13:04.720000 - 0:13:06.520000::I don't need that right now.
0:13:06.520000 - 0:13:07.520000::The salt.
0:13:07.520000 - 0:13:08.960000::There's no salt in that though.
0:13:08.960000 - 0:13:09.960000::I already checked.
0:13:09.960000 - 0:13:13.040000::Can I say something about Eric's nose real quick?
0:13:13.040000 - 0:13:15.200000::No, not like that.
0:13:15.200000 - 0:13:21.240000::Listen, I don't think I've ever been this close with my year to Eric's nose before.
0:13:21.240000 - 0:13:28.240000::I can hear you breathing is very ASMR like from this distance.
0:13:28.240000 - 0:13:29.240000::Does the.
0:13:29.240000 - 0:13:33.080000::Is Eric has a heavy breath?
0:13:33.080000 - 0:13:36.080000::I yeah, and that's not good for my health.
0:13:36.080000 - 0:13:40.860000::But when I would watch the sopranos and hear Tony soprano aka James Gandalf and you
0:13:40.860000 - 0:13:45.200000::the actor breathing, it would calm me down so intensely.
0:13:45.200000 - 0:13:47.240000::And I would try to do that type of breathing on purpose.
0:13:47.240000 - 0:13:52.320000::But now that my body has gotten to it's mostly the muscle that causes all that added muscle.
0:13:52.320000 - 0:13:54.320000::Yeah, it's the weight.
0:13:54.320000 - 0:13:57.360000::It's yeah, it's weight, but it's it's dense muscle.
0:13:57.360000 - 0:14:00.360000::Yeah, that now I can't lay low.
0:14:00.360000 - 0:14:05.600000::We'll say like damn, you're breathing a louder watch in the murder mystery.
0:14:05.600000 - 0:14:06.600000::And it hurts my foot.
0:14:06.600000 - 0:14:11.800000::It doesn't hurt my feelings, but it makes me worried for my longevity.
0:14:11.800000 - 0:14:13.440000::I think it would worry about it.
0:14:13.440000 - 0:14:21.360000::If you were to be like some sort of like my boss, just a la Tony soprano, you know, you
0:14:21.360000 - 0:14:27.800000::had some underlings that were working in a strip club or something like that.
0:14:27.800000 - 0:14:31.400000::And I feel like they could they could hear you come like they would be like, Oh, shit,
0:14:31.400000 - 0:14:36.040000::the boss is coming from your breath like nearby if you were coming in the rain.
0:14:36.040000 - 0:14:37.360000::The boss.
0:14:37.360000 - 0:14:40.240000::That implies that they're hiding things from me.
0:14:40.240000 - 0:14:47.240000::If I ran a underground operation like that, it would be based on trust and any rat,
0:14:47.240000 - 0:14:52.560000::anybody hiding anything immediate execution and I would make examples quickly.
0:14:52.560000 - 0:14:56.840000::So that's a funny scenario, but that would never happen in my operation.
0:14:56.840000 - 0:14:58.840000::Let me say if Eric.

0:15:00 - 0:15:05::I feel like there, it'd be funny if there is a movie or something or Eric, you play like a mob boss in Russia
0:15:05 - 0:15:10::and you think you have this like incredible under like, you've gotten away with so much
0:15:10 - 0:15:14::but every single person in the entire gang is CIA.
0:15:14 - 0:15:17::You're the only person everybody knows.
0:15:17 - 0:15:19::They're the worst fake Russian accents.
0:15:19 - 0:15:21::Like, we've got to tell them, sir.
0:15:21 - 0:15:23::We all listen.
0:15:24 - 0:15:26::So caught, so busted.
0:15:26 - 0:15:29::You're like being used is the only reason you're in there.
0:15:29 - 0:15:34::And you're like a huge people pleaser to like every any time somebody's like begging like,
0:15:34 - 0:15:35::do not be in the car.
0:15:35 - 0:15:36::Oh my god.
0:15:36 - 0:15:38::Any time off what?
0:15:38 - 0:15:40::I got the title of the movie. It just came to me.
0:15:40 - 0:15:42::The King Pond.
0:15:42 - 0:15:43::The King Pond.
0:15:43 - 0:15:44::You see what I'm saying?
0:15:44 - 0:15:47::It's like the King pin but it's the King Pond because it's a pond.
0:15:47 - 0:15:48::Oh shit.
0:15:48 - 0:15:49::And he AWN.
0:15:49 - 0:15:50::Universal Studios.
0:15:50 - 0:15:51::What the hell, man?
0:15:51 - 0:15:54::I think that means we have to make it because the title just came so quick.
0:15:55 - 0:15:57::Coming this summer.
0:15:57 - 0:16:00::I'm tired of being thought of like this as a joke.
0:16:00 - 0:16:01::Eric.
0:16:01 - 0:16:03::Eric's.
0:16:03 - 0:16:05::Google Doc manifesto.
0:16:05 - 0:16:07::Google Doc is getting surprisingly long.
0:16:07 - 0:16:13::He won't let me read it but I see him typing on it constantly on tour on the airplane in the biggest font I've ever seen in my life.
0:16:13 - 0:16:14::It's all symbols.
0:16:14 - 0:16:16::It's all it's no letters anymore. It's just symbols.
0:16:16 - 0:16:18::It's a winged big font.
0:16:18 - 0:16:20::Some of them are letters.
0:16:20 - 0:16:21::You have to interpret it.
0:16:21 - 0:16:23::It's like an interpretive dance.
0:16:23 - 0:16:25::But text.
0:16:25 - 0:16:26::Yeah.
0:16:26 - 0:16:30::87 point font.
0:16:30 - 0:16:33::Man.
0:16:33 - 0:16:35::Oh man, I need a nap.
0:16:35 - 0:16:36::What else?
0:16:36 - 0:16:37::That's what Eric said.
0:16:37 - 0:16:38::I said this.
0:16:38 - 0:16:41::Just about the Midwest.
0:16:41 - 0:16:44::So I grew up in Ohio.
0:16:44 - 0:16:50::And all throughout my childhood, I considered Ohio.
0:16:50 - 0:16:53::I was a part of the East Coast.
0:16:53 - 0:16:54::I don't know.
0:16:54 - 0:16:56::No one, no one ever.
0:16:56 - 0:17:01::No one ever can talk about Ohio as the Midwest to me.
0:17:01 - 0:17:07::And I know I wasn't, you know, talking to a lot of people as a kid, you know, so that might be the loser.
0:17:07 - 0:17:13::What was going on here, you know, if I would to be a more people.
0:17:13 - 0:17:14::Interesting.
0:17:14 - 0:17:17::Cool that you guys call me that.
0:17:17 - 0:17:18::I know.
0:17:18 - 0:17:20::From two of my best friends.
0:17:20 - 0:17:21::Awesome.
0:17:21 - 0:17:26::But yeah, nobody would call it the Midwest to me.
0:17:26 - 0:17:27::You know what I'm saying?
0:17:27 - 0:17:30::And I just thought like, well, what's the answer?
0:17:30 - 0:17:35::Well, I just thought like we're, I'm the, being from Ohio is the same as being from New York City.
0:17:35 - 0:17:44::You know, I never, I always thought, I thought the Midwest was like fairly Chicago was 제대로 even considered it.
0:17:44 - 0:17:46::I thought it was maybe more of that.
0:17:46 - 0:17:47::Yeah, Iowa.
0:17:47 - 0:17:48::I was like, oh, yeah, for sure.
0:17:48 - 0:17:49::Iowa is the Midwest.
0:17:49 - 0:17:50::Like that's where it starts.
0:17:50 - 0:17:55::Well, yeah, Chicago's kind of Midwest, but kind of.
0:17:55 - 0:18:04::Once you start getting out, I mean, it is, but once you get out and that corn, here's how I mean, that's when you're mid-west.
0:18:04 - 0:18:09::I didn't realize what the mid, like to me that Ohio was the East Coast growing up.
0:18:09 - 0:18:11::And I was on the East Coast problem.
0:18:11 - 0:18:12::Okay, there we go.
0:18:12 - 0:18:14::I think it is the East Coast.
0:18:14 - 0:18:17::But I didn't really have any concept of the Midwest.
0:18:17 - 0:18:28::I feel like when I was a kid, I guess I probably must have known that Chicago was the Midwest, but that's kind of, to me, the Midwest, when I was doing up meant the Chicago land area.
0:18:28 - 0:18:32::And then like Iowa and Wyoming, that was just the country, I guess is what I would think of that.
0:18:32 - 0:18:37::Because how far West can you go and still be in the Midwest?
0:18:37 - 0:18:38::Not that far.
0:18:38 - 0:18:40::Not Montana.
0:18:40 - 0:18:45::I think growing up in Seattle, I never heard the word Chicago until I was about 17.
0:18:45 - 0:18:47::I didn't even think of it as a city.
0:18:47 - 0:18:49::What is that?
0:18:49 - 0:18:51::It's all a city out in the middle of the country.
0:18:51 - 0:18:54::What about moving the ocean, but really it's a lake.
0:18:54 - 0:18:55::I didn't even think about it.
0:18:55 - 0:18:58::Do you all know how deep the Great Lakes are?
0:18:58 - 0:19:00::200 feet well over.
0:19:00 - 0:19:02::Because that's hardly the Superman ride of steel.
0:19:02 - 0:19:08::You'd have to have about, you'd have to about have about a hundred of those to get even close to some of these deep lakes.
0:19:08 - 0:19:10::Yeah, really that deep.
0:19:10 - 0:19:13::They may as they are as deep as fuck.
0:19:13 - 0:19:14::You know what's going on.
0:19:14 - 0:19:17::Oh shit, I just figured it out.
0:19:17 - 0:19:22::This podcast is about to be deleted off of Spotify, Apple iTunes.
0:19:22 - 0:19:23::That's right.
0:19:23 - 0:19:25::Fuck and say the shit.
0:19:25 - 0:19:27::You know how they're like, what's at the bottom of the ocean?
0:19:27 - 0:19:31::That is a decoy conspiracy theory.
0:19:31 - 0:19:35::What we need to be talking about is it's right in front of our faces.
0:19:35 - 0:19:39::Whatever were the alien spacecrafts are in the fucking lakes.
0:19:39 - 0:19:43::They're at the bottom of the fucking great lakes, dude.
0:19:43 - 0:19:46::You can't hardly call these things like us off.
0:19:46 - 0:19:47::They're fucking big.
0:19:47 - 0:19:50::I was flying in Toronto looking over the lake, whatever.
0:19:50 - 0:19:52::I don't know, a lake Ontario or something.
0:19:52 - 0:19:53::I don't know.
0:19:53 - 0:19:54::It was so big.
0:19:54 - 0:20:00::I thought I was literally looking out over the coastline or whatever the horizon from the airplane.

0:20:00 - 0:20:02.480000::from the clouds and I was thinking, wow, the ocean's big.
0:20:02.480000 - 0:20:03.720000::Wait a minute, what the fuck?
0:20:03.720000 - 0:20:04.720000::That's a lake.
0:20:04.720000 - 0:20:07.440000::No, sir, at why?
0:20:07.440000 - 0:20:09.400000::We've, I know we've already had a conversation
0:20:09.400000 - 0:20:12.160000::about the categories of water
0:20:12.160000 - 0:20:14.400000::and how we're changing the name of different bodies of water
0:20:14.400000 - 0:20:15.280000::when it's certain waters
0:20:15.280000 - 0:20:17.040000::and certain organizational patterns,
0:20:17.040000 - 0:20:18.200000::but I don't think that should be called
0:20:18.200000 - 0:20:21.440000::the fucking lake just because of the salt content.
0:20:21.440000 - 0:20:25.480000::Cause one more thing, one more thing really quick.
0:20:25.480000 - 0:20:26.800000::The Hudson Bay.
0:20:28.240000 - 0:20:29.520000::You guys are familiar with that, right?
0:20:29.520000 - 0:20:30.360000::Of course.
0:20:30.360000 - 0:20:33.800000::That thing is a fucking bigger than the United States.
0:20:36.040000 - 0:20:38.880000::Well, that's a true, but I rest my case.
0:20:38.880000 - 0:20:39.720000::For your sake.
0:20:39.720000 - 0:20:42.720000::Hey, you're telling me I can't shove a straw in this bitch
0:20:42.720000 - 0:20:45.360000::and fucking just start sucking up on it.
0:20:45.360000 - 0:20:48.760000::And I'm gonna die if I have a sip of the great lakes.
0:20:48.760000 - 0:20:50.040000::What kind of world do we live in?
0:20:50.040000 - 0:20:51.040000::That's the, that's the shame.
0:20:51.040000 - 0:20:52.200000::No, you can drink it.
0:20:53.560000 - 0:20:56.280000::I used to bring pales out to the lake in college
0:20:56.280000 - 0:20:58.600000::and fucking just chill it, put it in a bread at.
0:20:58.880000 - 0:21:02.120000::Make my shroom tea.
0:21:02.120000 - 0:21:05.720000::If I can sell that for $100, pay for tuition,
0:21:05.720000 - 0:21:07.080000::pull by Vance in there.
0:21:07.080000 - 0:21:10.920000::And yeah, all, okay, this is what I was gonna say.
0:21:12.360000 - 0:21:14.760000::How do we know about the great lakes?
0:21:14.760000 - 0:21:16.080000::How are lakes formed?
0:21:16.080000 - 0:21:20.040000::Well, what they say is that giant glaciers
0:21:20.040000 - 0:21:22.240000::cut through on their path.
0:21:22.240000 - 0:21:24.720000::So here's how I understand it.
0:21:24.720000 - 0:21:28.560000::In the ice age, glaciers covered much of the world
0:21:28.560000 - 0:21:31.200000::especially at North when it's even colder.
0:21:31.200000 - 0:21:35.680000::And as they mount, you say you put an ice cube on a table, right?
0:21:35.680000 - 0:21:38.120000::As that table heats up, where's the ice cube go?
0:21:38.120000 - 0:21:39.080000::Does it stay static?
0:21:39.080000 - 0:21:41::Now, especially if it's tilted,
0:21:41 - 0:21:43::starts to go downhill a bit
0:21:43 - 0:21:45.680000::and starts to cut through the...
0:21:50.520000 - 0:21:51.640000::What are you doing? Are you sleeping?
0:21:51.640000 - 0:21:52.640000::No, no.
0:21:52.640000 - 0:21:55.640000::Basically, what we know is that while eating it to glaciers.
0:21:56.480000 - 0:22:00.240000::You're saying ice cubes go downhill when you slide them?
0:22:00.240000 - 0:22:03.640000::What I'm saying is that glacier theory doesn't make sense, right?
0:22:03.640000 - 0:22:06.440000::I'm trying to explain how there's no way
0:22:06.440000 - 0:22:10.240000::what we're being told by the scientific institutions is great.
0:22:10.240000 - 0:22:14.520000::What could be more likely is a giant ship, maybe from off world.
0:22:15.880000 - 0:22:19.040000::It uses some type of drilling technology
0:22:19.040000 - 0:22:21.360000::to drill these damn things filled up with water
0:22:21.360000 - 0:22:23.200000::that got a hose on the ship, just filled that shit up,
0:22:23.200000 - 0:22:28.200000::like a kiddie pool, and put that alien base down at the bottom of that.
0:22:28.200000 - 0:22:32.440000::You know where the deepest lake in the world is, right?
0:22:32.440000 - 0:22:33.120000::It's in...
0:22:33.120000 - 0:22:35.640000::It's lake by Kyle in ancient Russia.
0:22:35.640000 - 0:22:37.160000::What do you think Moscow is hiding?
0:22:37.160000 - 0:22:38.280000::He did know that.
0:22:38.280000 - 0:22:39.640000::That's impressive, Verick. Thanks.
0:22:39.640000 - 0:22:40.920000::Wow.
0:22:40.920000 - 0:22:42.440000::It's wide deep, bro.
0:22:42.440000 - 0:22:44.160000::That's 10,000 feet deep.
0:22:44.160000 - 0:22:46.040000::It's very fucking deep.
0:22:46.040000 - 0:22:47.440000::And guess what?
0:22:47.440000 - 0:22:50.440000::It's very fucking landlocked.
0:22:50.440000 - 0:22:52.320000::Riddle me that.
0:22:52.320000 - 0:22:56.680000::And that's why we're not fucking starting a world war with...
0:22:56.680000 - 0:22:58.120000::So you guys are getting hyped up, man.
0:22:58.120000 - 0:23:00.120000::I can feel the sugar rushes.
0:23:00.120000 - 0:23:02.040000::You guys are like fucking children.
0:23:02.040000 - 0:23:03.560000::You guys are children.
0:23:03.560000 - 0:23:07.280000::You guys are getting all fucking hyped up, really.
0:23:07.280000 - 0:23:08.760000::It's like dumbass.
0:23:10.880000 - 0:23:14.760000::I feel like I'm talking to two stewards from that DB right now.
0:23:14.760000 - 0:23:17.720000::It is getting to the age.
0:23:17.720000 - 0:23:21.600000::I think 31 seems to be an age where...
0:23:21.600000 - 0:23:26.800000::If you slam candy down on the counter at any type of store, it's embarrassing.
0:23:26.800000 - 0:23:29.080000::We shouldn't be eating this.
0:23:29.080000 - 0:23:30.080000::There should be an age...
0:23:30.080000 - 0:23:32.320000::You know how there's like an age limit to...
0:23:32.320000 - 0:23:34.280000::There should be an age cap for some things.
0:23:34.280000 - 0:23:35.800000::You know what I'm saying?
0:23:35.800000 - 0:23:36.800000::Like...
0:23:36.800000 - 0:23:40.240000::I think candy, the candy cut off is what?
0:23:40.240000 - 0:23:41.240000::48.
0:23:41.240000 - 0:23:43.720000::Because you shouldn't be having that at...
0:23:43.720000 - 0:23:47.520000::You know, a 90-year-old shouldn't be eating candy.
0:23:47.520000 - 0:23:48.920000::You shouldn't be eating fucking candy.
0:23:48.920000 - 0:23:52.520000::Well, that's a my 97, 96-year-old grandma who's no longer with us.
0:23:52.520000 - 0:23:56.440000::Who was eating spaghetti and cow tails to the day she went back with...
0:23:56.440000 - 0:23:58.760000::But those are old candies from the 1920s.
0:23:58.760000 - 0:24:00.520000::Yeah, old candies are good.
0:24:00.520000 - 0:24:01.520000::They're good for you.
0:24:01.520000 - 0:24:02.520000::The Necko Wafers.
0:24:02.520000 - 0:24:05.960000::You think Jeremy Allen White, we could ask him next time I see him.
0:24:05.960000 - 0:24:06.960000::He's eating candy.
0:24:06.960000 - 0:24:08.760000::He's hell now.
0:24:08.760000 - 0:24:10.760000::You will never see him again, dude.
0:24:10.760000 - 0:24:12.240000::Dude, the way you acted.
0:24:12.240000 - 0:24:13.240000::Remember me?

0:24:17.800000 - 0:24:19.800000::No, no, no, no, no rumors.
0:24:19.800000 - 0:24:20.800000::It's not a rumor.
0:24:20.800000 - 0:24:22.960000::I so...

0:27:00.240000 - 0:27:09.520000::have when you have raw Nate when you have raw spaghetti it will have less sugar than if you cook
0:27:09.520000 - 0:27:16.080000::it in the longer you cook it the more sugar molecules are separated from the spaghetti thing into
0:27:17.120000 - 0:27:23.360000::into the well that's good that's the best I could do who who eats this spaghetti extra al dente

0:30:31.200000 - 0:30:32.200000::Never let that shit.
0:30:32.200000 - 0:30:33.200000::Let that shit.
0:30:33.200000 - 0:30:34.200000::That's like past.

0:30:39.320000 - 0:30:40.320000::Drop your smells.
0:30:40.320000 - 0:30:41.320000::Drop your cigarettes on it.
0:30:41.320000 - 0:30:44.200000::Get some cubes, some body hair up in that shit.
0:30:44.200000 - 0:30:45.200000::Finger nails.
0:30:45.200000 - 0:30:46.200000::That's when you get that good smell.
0:30:46.200000 - 0:30:47.200000::Finger nails.
0:30:47.200000 - 0:30:48.200000::That cereal off.

0:30:54.680000 - 0:30:56.160000::You smell the person who used that earlier.
0:30:56.160000 - 0:30:58.560000::You know, like imagine walking into a tent
0:30:58.560000 - 0:31:00.560000::and then you get some and pass the way in four days ago.
0:31:00.560000 - 0:31:01.560000::A tent?
0:31:01.560000 - 0:31:02.560000::Ooh.

0:31:06.560000 - 0:31:07.560000::Do you wear?
0:31:07.560000 - 0:31:08.560000::What were they wearing?

0:31:15.560000 - 0:31:16.560000::Marco.
0:31:16.560000 - 0:31:20.560000::By the way, if you haven't purchased tickets to the Los Angeles

0:31:27.560000 - 0:31:28.560000::You sold out.
0:31:28.560000 - 0:31:29.560000::It's basically sold out.
0:31:29.560000 - 0:31:30.560000::So get your tickets.
0:31:30.560000 - 0:31:32.560000::Oh, we're adding somebody to the show.
0:31:32.560000 - 0:31:33.560000::What's that?
0:31:33.560000 - 0:31:34.560000::Guess who's doing this?
0:31:34.560000 - 0:31:36.560000::Guess who's doing the show in LA.
0:31:36.560000 - 0:31:37.560000::Uh oh, wow.
0:31:37.560000 - 0:31:38.560000::You wish you bought a ticket now.

0:31:45.560000 - 0:31:46.560000::Most excellent friend.
0:31:46.560000 - 0:31:48.560000::Connor O'Malley.
0:31:48.560000 - 0:31:51.560000::Yeah, it's about to go.
0:31:51.560000 - 0:31:54.560000::So the weird guys are back at this.
0:31:54.560000 - 0:31:55.560000::Yeah.
0:31:55.560000 - 0:31:58.560000::We had to sum normal to others.
0:31:58.560000 - 0:32:02.560000::If you find us weird, I have a whole fucking artist.
0:32:02.560000 - 0:32:04.560000::You must find museums weird too.
0:32:04.560000 - 0:32:05.560000::We're riding.
0:32:05.560000 - 0:32:06.560000::We must find Mozart weird.
0:32:06.560000 - 0:32:07.560000::We're not that weird.
0:32:07.560000 - 0:32:09.560000::Mozart was all back in the day doing DIY.
0:32:09.560000 - 0:32:10.560000::Mozart, Vienna.
0:32:10.560000 - 0:32:12.560000::Freaky, sexually, I think.
0:32:12.560000 - 0:32:13.560000::Was he blind as well?
0:32:13.560000 - 0:32:14.560000::That was a different one.
0:32:14.560000 - 0:32:15.560000::I had to be a toven.
0:32:15.560000 - 0:32:18.560000::Just let them both be blind.
0:32:18.560000 - 0:32:21.560000::They didn't need eyes to make that.
0:32:21.560000 - 0:32:22.560000::Now hold on.
0:32:22.560000 - 0:32:23.560000::Didn't Beethoven kind of cheat?
0:32:23.560000 - 0:32:24.560000::No disrespect.
0:32:24.560000 - 0:32:25.560000::He was a cheater.
0:32:25.560000 - 0:32:26.560000::No, not like that.
0:32:26.560000 - 0:32:27.560000::He was unfaithful.
0:32:27.560000 - 0:32:28.560000::No, not like that.
0:32:28.560000 - 0:32:31.560000::Wasn't he fully not blind most of the time?
0:32:31.560000 - 0:32:35.560000::And then he became blind after he already did the Learn piano?
0:32:35.560000 - 0:32:36.560000::Well, here's my, I don't know.
0:32:36.560000 - 0:32:37.560000::I'm thinking about time, remember.
0:32:37.560000 - 0:32:38.560000::What?
0:32:38.560000 - 0:32:40.560000::Well, I want to bring it back to Shakespeare a little bit.
0:32:40.560000 - 0:32:42.560000::And I think that, you know, thank you.
0:32:42.560000 - 0:32:43.560000::It always does.
0:32:43.560000 - 0:32:44.560000::Yeah.
0:32:44.560000 - 0:32:48.560000::I want to bring it back to him because I feel like there's a theory out there that
0:32:48.560000 - 0:32:53.560000::that Shakespeare is a collection of a bunch of people's works.
0:32:53.560000 - 0:32:55.560000::Playwrights from that time.
0:32:55.560000 - 0:32:56.560000::Okay.
0:32:56.560000 - 0:32:58.560000::And then they just attribute it to one guy.
0:32:58.560000 - 0:33:00.560000::And you know how easy that would be back then.
0:33:00.560000 - 0:33:02.560000::You know, easy to is now to do that to Ghosts.
0:33:02.560000 - 0:33:03.560000::Right.
0:33:03.560000 - 0:33:05.560000::There's people that Ghosts write for Drake.
0:33:05.560000 - 0:33:08.560000::And we think that he's, we still don't know who's fucking right in these, these rhymes.
0:33:08.560000 - 0:33:11.560000::Even though we have GoPro's everywhere, we have fucking street cams.
0:33:11.560000 - 0:33:12.560000::We have the highest.
0:33:12.560000 - 0:33:14.560000::You want to put, you want to put body cameras on rappers?
0:33:14.560000 - 0:33:15.560000::Is that reason?
0:33:15.560000 - 0:33:16.560000::Yeah, of course.
0:33:16.560000 - 0:33:18.560000::I want to know what they're up to.
0:33:18.560000 - 0:33:19.560000::Um, but.
0:33:19.560000 - 0:33:23.560000::Imagine looking down this guy's fucking going, going down on you.
0:33:23.560000 - 0:33:24.560000::Oh my.
0:33:24.560000 - 0:33:25.560000::He's going to be in our ring.
0:33:25.560000 - 0:33:29.560000::Oh, we're seeing a picture of William Shakespeare in a earring.
0:33:29.560000 - 0:33:31.560000::He was kind of like that.
0:33:31.560000 - 0:33:32.560000::He's holding.
0:33:32.560000 - 0:33:35.560000::Well, I think he was more bald than that.
0:33:35.560000 - 0:33:37.560000::He's not bald at all.
0:33:37.560000 - 0:33:39.560000::That's not bald in any way.
0:33:39.560000 - 0:33:40.560000::Damn.
0:33:40.560000 - 0:33:41.560000::They got the earrings.
0:33:41.560000 - 0:33:43.560000::What, what was he Italian?
0:33:43.560000 - 0:33:46.560000::Not even British, dude.
0:33:46.560000 - 0:33:48.560000::Was he Italian?
0:33:48.560000 - 0:33:50.560000::He was.
0:33:50.560000 - 0:33:51.560000::You know what?
0:33:51.560000 - 0:33:54.560000::It's not messy because I didn't have to think about it for a second.
0:33:54.560000 - 0:33:55.560000::Like, was he?
0:33:55.560000 - 0:33:57.560000::No, he's one of the brits.
0:33:57.560000 - 0:33:58.560000::This was looking at his hair.
0:33:58.560000 - 0:33:59.560000::Of course he's fucking British.
0:33:59.560000 - 0:34:00.560000::The William Shakespeare thing.
0:34:00.560000 - 0:34:01.560000::Well, I think a lot of his plays.
0:34:01.560000 - 0:34:03.560000::You could, you could do this, Nate.
0:34:03.560000 - 0:34:05.560000::You are closer to this.
0:34:05.560000 - 0:34:06.560000::Of course.
0:34:06.560000 - 0:34:07.560000::Of course.
0:34:07.560000 - 0:34:08.560000::Yeah.
0:34:08.560000 - 0:34:11.560000::I would blow, blow dry your hair.
0:34:11.560000 - 0:34:15.560000::Well, when you had the long hair, I loved when you had that long hair.
0:34:15.560000 - 0:34:16.560000::I know.
0:34:16.560000 - 0:34:18.560000::I was like, please.
0:34:18.560000 - 0:34:20.560000::Will you ever grow the hair back in the back again?
0:34:20.560000 - 0:34:21.560000::You know what?
0:34:21.560000 - 0:34:24.560000::I was like, kind of, it was getting a little long there for a second.
0:34:24.560000 - 0:34:27.560000::And then I like shaved it off when I went to Mexico.
0:34:27.560000 - 0:34:29.560000::But I want to get back to there.
0:34:29.560000 - 0:34:34.560000::You know, ideally, I want to have that, that, that, let my hair just kind of get,
0:34:34.560000 - 0:34:36.560000::go free in that way.
0:34:36.560000 - 0:34:40.560000::Because there's just not a lot of bald representation in that manner.
0:34:40.560000 - 0:34:45.560000::You know, a lot of people are afraid to, to, you know,
0:34:45.560000 - 0:34:48.560000::let it, let it, let it, let it ride like that.
0:34:48.560000 - 0:34:49.560000::There's so much, let it grow up.
0:34:49.560000 - 0:34:52.560000::There's so much bald fear at the moment that I can feel through that.
0:34:52.560000 - 0:34:53.560000::All the shame.
0:34:53.560000 - 0:34:54.560000::All the shame in my fellow men.
0:34:54.560000 - 0:34:55.560000::All the shame in my fellow men.
0:34:55.560000 - 0:34:56.560000::Look at all your daydreaming.
0:34:56.560000 - 0:34:59.560000::Please bring back the, bring back the, the, the in hair.

0:35:00 - 0:35:03.280000::You don't need to everybody goes, oh, if you're gonna be bald,
0:35:03.280000 - 0:35:05.360000::if you're gonna be this, you better get fucking big,
0:35:05.360000 - 0:35:09.640000::like Vin Diesel, no man, let it all just ride,
0:35:09.640000 - 0:35:11.360000::let the body ride, let the hair ride.
0:35:11.360000 - 0:35:13.440000::Go watch some of those rubbered Altman movies
0:35:13.440000 - 0:35:16.800000::from the 70s, a lot of them look like, not like shit,
0:35:16.800000 - 0:35:19.840000::but I feel like lean into looking like shit.
0:35:19.840000 - 0:35:21.280000::You know what I'm saying?
0:35:21.280000 - 0:35:24.280000::And everybody apparently, and what were they fucking eating
0:35:24.280000 - 0:35:25.720000::back then, because everybody looked
0:35:25.720000 - 0:35:29.560000::be about 135 pounds, not kidding you.
0:35:29.560000 - 0:35:30.720000::Tight jeans.
0:35:30.720000 - 0:35:34::They had big buckles tucked in for the GMOs,
0:35:34 - 0:35:36.480000::and the red dice that we see is, all right?
0:35:36.480000 - 0:35:38.560000::Why are they fattening that stuff?
0:35:38.560000 - 0:35:41.760000::What's it called when you ruin the earth through planting?
0:35:41.760000 - 0:35:42.760000::Capitalism.
0:35:43.560000 - 0:35:44.640000::No, Nate, please.
0:35:44.640000 - 0:35:46.840000::Interesting, an erotic capitalism.
0:35:46.840000 - 0:35:47.840000::It's called the picture.
0:35:47.840000 - 0:35:50.520000::It's called the bio, you know what I'm saying?
0:35:51.520000 - 0:35:53.200000::Does anybody know this term?
0:35:53.200000 - 0:35:54.040000::Bio.
0:35:54.040000 - 0:35:55.160000::No, biohacking.
0:35:55.200000 - 0:35:57.440000::When you, when you farm too much,
0:35:57.440000 - 0:35:58.840000::it does something to the over farm.
0:35:58.840000 - 0:36:00.840000::Biohidic degradation.
0:36:00.840000 - 0:36:02.920000::Biohidic legacy.
0:36:02.920000 - 0:36:04.680000::Biohose.
0:36:04.680000 - 0:36:06.280000::Chris, we don't know.
0:36:06.280000 - 0:36:07.280000::We just don't know.
0:36:07.280000 - 0:36:08.120000::We just don't know.
0:36:08.120000 - 0:36:09.040000::I'll have to Google it later.
0:36:09.040000 - 0:36:11.080000::I'll have to Google it later.
0:36:11.080000 - 0:36:11.840000::I'll have to Google it later.
0:36:11.840000 - 0:36:15.240000::Okay, so, but when I went upstairs to that green room,
0:36:15.240000 - 0:36:17.120000::I got fully immersed back in it.
0:36:17.120000 - 0:36:18.640000::It made me realize, you know what?
0:36:18.640000 - 0:36:20.520000::I think I did have a Midwest experience,

0:52:06.240000 - 0:52:07.360000::just answer the question.

0:52:09.360000 - 0:52:11.960000::Yeah, just sitting, but at a certain angle, dude,
0:52:11.960000 - 0:52:14.720000::if you sit at the right angle, anybody's legs will fall asleep,
0:52:14.720000 - 0:52:15.960000::no matter what weight you are.
0:52:15.960000 - 0:52:16.720000::Yeah, and now, dude,
0:52:16.720000 - 0:52:20.160000::you know when you're sitting on a toilet for too long,
0:52:20.160000 - 0:52:22.600000::and I used to get this all the time playing Game Boy on the
0:52:22.600000 - 0:52:25.160000::toilet or reading my mom's Oprah magazines,
0:52:25.160000 - 0:52:27.640000::but you sit on that thing for too long,
0:52:27.640000 - 0:52:28.560000::and you don't even know,
0:52:28.560000 - 0:52:29.520000::you don't even think about your legs,
0:52:29.520000 - 0:52:30.680000::and then all of a sudden,
0:52:30.680000 - 0:52:31.880000::before the tingles start,
0:52:31.880000 - 0:52:33.720000::it's like your legs go quiet.
0:52:33.720000 - 0:52:35.920000::There's like a silence in your legs.
0:52:35.920000 - 0:52:37.560000::Ooh, and then you're like,
0:52:37.560000 - 0:52:39.840000::damn, this shit's about to fucking be tingling.
0:52:39.840000 - 0:52:41.320000::Then as soon as you know it,
0:52:41.320000 - 0:52:42.920000::next thing,
0:52:42.920000 - 0:52:44.320000::tingling on your legs.
0:52:44.320000 - 0:52:46.440000::I like that stuff, though.
0:52:46.440000 - 0:52:50.040000::When there's a pain like that that I know is just fine.
0:52:50.040000 - 0:52:53.240000::Like if I get a foot cramp or if my legs go numb,
0:52:53.240000 - 0:52:54.640000::sometimes I like to go,
0:52:54.920000 - 0:52:57.200000::because you know how you can stop a foot cramp?
0:52:58.240000 - 0:52:59.400000::Does anybody know this?
0:52:59.400000 - 0:53:00.240000::Yeah, pinch it.
0:53:00.240000 - 0:53:01.080000::I think so.
0:53:01.080000 - 0:53:01.920000::Well, you press it.
0:53:01.920000 - 0:53:02.920000::Press it against something usually helps,
0:53:02.920000 - 0:53:04.160000::but sometimes I go, you know what?
0:53:04.160000 - 0:53:08.240000::Let me just ride this and see just how painful can it get,
0:53:10.200000 - 0:53:12.160000::because I don't care a lot of stuff like that.
0:53:12.160000 - 0:53:13.400000::Addicted to pain.
0:53:13.400000 - 0:53:15.800000::Sometimes addicted to the feeling of that.
0:53:15.800000 - 0:53:18.920000::How you scratch a, a scab.
0:53:18.920000 - 0:53:19.920000::Right.
0:53:19.920000 - 0:53:20.760000::Yeah.
0:53:20.760000 - 0:53:21.600000::Interesting.
0:53:21.600000 - 0:53:22.600000::Well, Nate, you have all those burns,
0:53:22.600000 - 0:53:24.400000::because you were trying to do that candle wax fetish,
0:53:24.400000 - 0:53:26::but you burned it way too hot.
0:53:26 - 0:53:28.240000::It made you a wonderful excuse.
0:53:28.240000 - 0:53:30.120000::This is what gets me off, you know?
0:53:30.120000 - 0:53:32.560000::And I keep wanting to try it, but.
0:53:32.560000 - 0:53:34.080000::Oh, dude.
0:53:34.080000 - 0:53:38.120000::And I've been watching whatever it's called, Milf Manor.
0:53:38.120000 - 0:53:40.360000::And this shit caught me way off guard.
0:53:40.360000 - 0:53:42.720000::When there's like a 20 year old kid and he goes like,
0:53:42.720000 - 0:53:45.720000::that, that mom is really, she's so beautiful.

0:53:50.400000 - 0:53:51.520000::I never felt that way.
0:53:51.520000 - 0:53:53.360000::Have you felt that way, Nate?
0:53:53.360000 - 0:53:55.640000::You shove a foot in the mouth?
0:53:55.640000 - 0:53:57.840000::Had to say that also on television.
0:53:57.840000 - 0:53:59.160000::Yeah.
0:53:59.160000 - 0:54:00.160000::Yeah.
0:54:00.160000 - 0:54:01.200000::That's crazy.

0:54:08.080000 - 0:54:08.920000::It's a funny thing.
0:54:08.920000 - 0:54:11.840000::And he was kind of like laughing sinisterly about it.

1:04:32.120000 - 1:04:34.880000::Glad to be able to get some sleep again.
1:04:34.880000 - 1:04:37.760000::And customs is kind of slipping.
1:04:37.760000 - 1:04:39.680000::I feel like I lied to get in.
1:04:39.680000 - 1:04:41.600000::I lied to get out.
1:04:41.600000 - 1:04:46.640000::Not lied, but like on the way out, I went to customs.
1:04:46.640000 - 1:04:49.440000::And they were like, I got to Canada.
1:04:49.440000 - 1:04:52.800000::They said, what are you doing here?
1:04:52.800000 - 1:04:54.880000::And I said, I'm here for work.
1:04:54.880000 - 1:04:56.760000::And they were like, really?
1:04:56.760000 - 1:04:57.720000::Like what's your work?
1:04:57.720000 - 1:05:00::And I said, uh, television?

1:05:00 - 1:05:02.160000::And I said, oh, like that.
1:05:02.160000 - 1:05:04.240000::And they're like, all right, go ahead.
1:05:04.240000 - 1:05:05.960000::And then coming back into America,
1:05:05.960000 - 1:05:08.840000::I showed my passport and the person goes,
1:05:09.960000 - 1:05:11.320000::you coming home?

1:05:19.040000 - 1:05:21.040000::So I kind of feel like customs.
1:05:21.040000 - 1:05:23.920000::I was really worried because I had never been through customs.
1:05:23.920000 - 1:05:25.440000::And I thought, oh man,
1:05:25.440000 - 1:05:28.680000::everyone's really gets held up in here for a long time.
1:05:28.680000 - 1:05:32.040000::It was honestly easier than getting extra blocks.
1:05:32.040000 - 1:05:34.120000::It was easier than, yeah.
1:05:34.120000 - 1:05:35.480000::I think it's easy to do that.
