0:00:00 - 0:00:07.520000::and get the most guac-duck burrito that you possibly can and take a crazy photo and send it to us and we'll fucking repost it.
0:00:07.520000 - 0:00:08.320000::Like guac-urrito.
0:00:08.320000 - 0:00:09.600000::The guac-urrito.
0:00:11.440000 - 0:00:18.960000::Welcome to Joy Tactics, the podcast dedicated to all things joyful, joyous and meeting as many celebrities as humanly possible.
0:00:18.960000 - 0:00:23.360000::Hosted by Eric Raheel, Meg Veroni and Jack Benzingen. Enjoy!
0:00:24.320000 - 0:00:26.720000::Alright, it's about 2 a.m.
0:00:26.720000 - 0:00:39.360000::We are at the Ocean Casina Resort and it's our last night in Atlantic City and we're just doing a post-mortem on tour what occurred here.
0:00:39.360000 - 0:00:51.360000::So as you can tell just from the tone of our voice straight up that our journey was not a success in many ways.
0:00:52.320000 - 0:01:02.320000::We kind of trusted that we would be taken care of by the universe and we've been let down harder than some professional boxers.
0:01:02.320000 - 0:01:06.320000::What's so fucked up about this is that last night.
0:01:06.320000 - 0:01:12.320000::This last night we probably have a clip that maybe we've already played or we will play about me talking about the duality of love.
0:01:12.320000 - 0:01:13.320000::Yeah. To where?
0:01:13.320000 - 0:01:18.320000::Oh, sometimes you're up, sometimes you're down, sometimes this, sometimes that.
0:01:18.320000 - 0:01:27.280000::Tonight it was so weird, it's almost like they had cameras on us and it makes me think that all the casinos are connected because we went to about five different casinos.
0:01:27.280000 - 0:01:32.320000::And at every single one, loss, loss.
0:01:32.320000 - 0:01:35.280000::It was weird, it was just odd.
0:01:35.280000 - 0:01:38.320000::It was just like, oh really?
0:01:38.320000 - 0:01:40.560000::How can we be losing this hard?
0:01:40.560000 - 0:01:44.560000::Yeah. Every single fucking slot machine at every table we go to.
0:01:44.560000 - 0:01:48.560000::It just fucked up that because we were winning at one point.
0:01:48.560000 - 0:01:52.560000::At one point it was winning, winning, winning, winning, winning.
0:01:52.560000 - 0:01:58.560000::I can't believe that this casino has given us this money right now and then it's just crashing down.
0:01:58.560000 - 0:02:02.560000::And meanwhile everybody else around us is caking out.
0:02:02.560000 - 0:02:04.560000::I'm like, are we the only freaking people everybody else here?
0:02:04.560000 - 0:02:06.560000::Everybody else here is by our table.
0:02:06.560000 - 0:02:14.560000::Some weird person that works with a casino where actually the only fucking people in this whole town that are real.
0:02:14.560000 - 0:02:18.560000::Well, let's walk the listeners through what happened yesterday.
0:02:18.560000 - 0:02:20.560000::We get in last night, we do the casinos.
0:02:20.560000 - 0:02:24.560000::And you heard me every time I, the slot machine made a noise, I'd go,
0:02:24.560000 - 0:02:26.560000::I'd make the noise back.
0:02:26.560000 - 0:02:29.560000::And I was making that noise in the hell last night.
0:02:29.560000 - 0:02:31.560000::Yeah, maybe too much.
0:02:31.560000 - 0:02:35.560000::And then we get to the three card poker at the resort because it is called resort.
0:02:35.560000 - 0:02:37.560000::Yeah, it is.
0:02:37.560000 - 0:02:43.560000::And it was $5 limit or $5 minimum meaning that you only had to play $5 per hand.
0:02:43.560000 - 0:02:47.560000::Amazing. Amazing. You can last for a while just be chilling.
0:02:47.560000 - 0:02:51.560000::And Jack and Nate learned how to play our plan.
0:02:51.560000 - 0:02:55.560000::I get down to my last, but I'm having fun and I'm going up and down and up and down,
0:02:55.560000 - 0:02:57.560000::which is what I feel like gambling should be.
0:02:57.560000 - 0:02:59.560000::Up and down. Up and down.
0:02:59.560000 - 0:03:07.560000::I get down to my last chips and I get down to literally my last hand.
0:03:07.560000 - 0:03:09.560000::And what happens? I get what did I get Jack?
0:03:09.560000 - 0:03:11.560000::A straight flush.
0:03:11.560000 - 0:03:13.560000::A straight up, a flush.
0:03:13.560000 - 0:03:17.560000::This is what every flush that means a consecutive all same,
0:03:17.560000 - 0:03:23.560000::uh, flush every single gambling addict dreams of this moment
0:03:23.560000 - 0:03:27.560000::where they are down to their last fucking penny.
0:03:27.560000 - 0:03:35.560000::And the gambling gods grace you with a crazy ass statistically unlikely win.
0:03:35.560000 - 0:03:37.560000::And Eric got that.
0:03:37.560000 - 0:03:39.560000::So crazy. It was insane.
0:03:39.560000 - 0:03:41.560000::You didn't even, you didn't even know what you were winning.
0:03:41.560000 - 0:03:45.560000::I know. I was like for a shock by the way you guys knew even less of what I was winning
0:03:45.560000 - 0:03:47.560000::because I was paying a little more attention.
0:03:47.560000 - 0:03:49.560000::But I put a hundred dollars down on the table.
0:03:49.560000 - 0:03:53.560000::I was down to my last five dollars for that bet.
0:03:53.560000 - 0:03:55.560000::I was like, oh, I'm going to go to the pool and put it down.
0:03:55.560000 - 0:03:57.560000::Oh, she goes, oh my God.
0:03:57.560000 - 0:03:59.560000::She can't believe it.
0:03:59.560000 - 0:04:03.560000::She was shot. She pulls out not one, but two hundred dollars chips.
0:04:03.560000 - 0:04:05.560000::She pulls out not one, but two twenty five dollars chips.
0:04:05.560000 - 0:04:11.560000::Then she pulls out not one, but two or three or four five dollars chips.
0:04:11.560000 - 0:04:13.560000::So I got two hundred and seventy dollars in chips.
0:04:13.560000 - 0:04:17.560000::I said, this is a sign from God. Good night.
0:04:17.560000 - 0:04:19.560000::And what do we do? We let the casino.
0:04:19.560000 - 0:04:21.560000::Cashed out on a high.
0:04:21.560000 - 0:04:23.560000::Do we fucking go? We're in a luxury.
0:04:23.560000 - 0:04:25.560000::It's time to rock out.
0:04:25.560000 - 0:04:27.560000::And then we went to bed.
0:04:27.560000 - 0:04:31.560000::And then the next day is a little day called Friday.
0:04:31.560000 - 0:04:35.560000::Now this is a different day of the week because you come in on a weekday
0:04:35.560000 - 0:04:39.560000::and they see you. They look at how many days you're staying in the hotel.
0:04:39.560000 - 0:04:41.560000::Okay, Eric Rehaz, but two nights.
0:04:41.560000 - 0:04:43.560000::Had the whatever oceanic.
0:04:43.560000 - 0:04:47.560000::So night number one, let's learn them in a little bit.
0:04:47.560000 - 0:04:49.560000::Yeah.
0:04:49.560000 - 0:04:53.560000::We got his information. His social security is a profile picture.
0:04:53.560000 - 0:04:55.560000::They got too much. They got cameras on him.
0:04:55.560000 - 0:04:57.560000::And then by the end of the, and then okay, now we're doing this.
0:04:57.560000 - 0:04:59.560000::This is last night. Now let's fuck them off.

0:05:00 - 0:05:07.840000::Let's let them see the real cards we have let's put aces on the table against them. Let's put a pair of twos on the table against them and meanwhile
0:05:08.880000 - 0:05:11.680000::I'm collateral damage actually I
0:05:12.360000 - 0:05:14.760000::Was that much how much did you lose?
0:05:16.280000 - 0:05:18.280000::$400
0:05:20.320000 - 0:05:23.320000::All right, I lost a lot of money
0:05:23.320000 - 0:05:30.200000::Let's be honest about the money. Let's just be on let's be straight up. Let's not even just what's let people know
0:05:30.200000 - 0:05:35.080000::Like not a lot of people will do this where they will let you know how much they're down right now
0:05:35.080000 - 0:05:41::Yeah, they gambling scenario, okay, and we're just gonna let you guys know just so that maybe if you're going to do a casino
0:05:41.200000 - 0:05:46.920000::You can know what are the potential dangers of doing so and we're we're able to
0:05:47.760000 - 0:05:52.800000::We're able to kind of provide that for you guys and kind of save we probably saved
0:05:53.320000 - 0:05:57.360000::By the way, we probably saved a lot of people hundreds and thousands of dollars
0:06:00.360000 - 0:06:08.600000::Because it's beautiful on its own way if you're up, but yeah, okay, but so for personally me I took out
0:06:09.240000 - 0:06:11.240000::$260
0:06:11.440000 - 0:06:16.320000::I'm so full right now. I took I took out $260 from an ATM last night
0:06:16.880000 - 0:06:22.200000::Okay, then I was up I lost some money from there, but then I was up to 70 so I forget what it was
0:06:22.840000 - 0:06:28.160000::Now after everything said down even after my big win last night when I went up to almost $400
0:06:28.680000 - 0:06:31.880000::Now I'm back down to about $80
0:06:32.600000 - 0:06:34.600000::And I put a total of
0:06:35.720000 - 0:06:40.560000::$28 in over two nights. Yeah, I think and I'm down
0:06:40.680000 - 0:06:46.160000::Yeah, $28 total. I'm a conservative gambler. I can't I
0:06:46.960000 - 0:06:50.360000::Like money too much that and I know that any
0:06:51.280000 - 0:06:55.880000::Hand that I put down whether it's a slot machine or a table. It's just gone
0:06:55.880000 - 0:06:59.240000::I've just done it too many times. I know you'd love the fuck out of money
0:06:59.240000 - 0:07:03.880000::But you don't just care for a bill right I like money too much to lose it
0:07:03.880000 - 0:07:10.520000::And I know that I'm gonna fucking lose it if I put it down on the table just it's just it's just statistically every time
0:07:10.520000 - 0:07:13.600000::I've never been up. I've never won money from a casino and
0:07:13.600000 - 0:07:15.280000::And
0:07:15.280000 - 0:07:21.600000::Today and yesterday is no difference and I should mention it is fucking 2 a.m. Right now on a Friday night
0:07:21.840000 - 0:07:23.840000::We're in a hotel
0:07:23.840000 - 0:07:25.840000::The hotel is fucking trash
0:07:25.840000 - 0:07:30.160000::We've had about two beers each but I know no no be honest because we've had about
0:07:32.600000 - 0:07:35.800000::Sure you're right. We had two beers, but then we had two
0:07:35.800000 - 0:07:40.960000::Tickles and two shots of Tickles. So what does that put us at six?
0:07:41.920000 - 0:07:47.280000::We're irresponsibly podcasting right now a lot of people say that you should be sober when you podcast
0:07:47.280000 - 0:07:54.640000::But do you think that we should be liqueur the fuck up and give you guys the motherfucking truth and be more honest and talk shit about people that we would normally do in our
0:07:54.640000 - 0:07:56.120000::Real lives. We're about to go in on our
0:07:56.120000 - 0:08:01.800000::We're about to we're about to say things that will blow your mind and shit that we would never say on the podcast normally
0:08:01.800000 - 0:08:04.360000::We were sober as fuck which we are on most of them
0:08:05.200000 - 0:08:10.080000::People are just like so glued to what we're saying right now and like pressing their head
0:08:10.080000 - 0:08:13.920000::Fung closer their head to hear even more of what we're saying. Yeah, because audio I'm so low
0:08:16.080000 - 0:08:22.800000::Closer to the fuck to your ears. Well, they have that for people who are hard appearing where you can connect your
0:08:23.440000 - 0:08:30::They like internal hearing aids, you know, yeah, and you can connect that to Bluetooth. I think all right and that
0:08:30.560000 - 0:08:35.320000::That's basically like music in your right ears right in your brain
0:08:36.720000 - 0:08:42.040000::But he backs with lame city let's walk them through the whole we can a little bit what we ate
0:08:43.080000 - 0:08:46.160000::Last night, right we do guys. It wasn't just gambling
0:08:46.160000 - 0:08:53.280000::It was hard we met so many people and so many people were like coming up to us and shit and it was just like so much of this was beautiful
0:08:53.280000 - 0:08:55.280000::So I don't want to be like
0:08:55.480000 - 0:08:57.480000::just talking shit, but
0:09:00 - 0:09:03.200000::We did have a lot of beautiful human interactions
0:09:04.560000 - 0:09:11.720000::Dancing with people oh we got dance all up apart. Okay, let's talk about what are the cuz we're talking about right now a lot of the
0:09:11.720000 - 0:09:17.560000::Negatives of gambling in Atlantic City, but what what does Atlantic City have to offer that is positive?
0:09:17.840000 - 0:09:20.040000::Here's what it is. It's a crumbling city
0:09:20.760000 - 0:09:25.400000::It's falling apart. There's there's more sadness on the streets and you can imagine
0:09:26.280000 - 0:09:32.260000::You don't feel safe walking around we literally asked a Uber driver. We said he's from
0:09:32.560000 - 0:09:34.760000::Atlantic City born and raised here and we said
0:09:35.440000 - 0:09:43.480000::Is this the worst Atlantic City's ever been he said yes? This is the worst year that he can ever remember so he clashed
0:09:43.480000 - 0:09:48.520000::Yeah, I mean this is one person, but this is we're in the worst version of Atlantic City ever
0:09:48.680000 - 0:09:52.960000::But he said but it's on the way up potentially
0:09:52.960000 - 0:10:00::It's on the be somebody who went to college is now the man. There's there's there's a some kind of crazy ass mayor

0:10:00 - 0:10:05.060000::That is changing these around change the game the mayor's can the local politics
0:10:05.060000 - 0:10:10.500000::And that's why we you can feel we need people to be voting at local level and that's what we care about a lot of people
0:10:10.500000 - 0:10:17.580000::Care about this national federal federal type shit. We are saying we need to organize grassroots movements around local politics
0:10:17.580000 - 0:10:20.940000::Because that's where the real change happens and a lot of people don't know that shit
0:10:22.100000 - 0:10:24.100000::Right right right
0:10:24.100000 - 0:10:26.860000::You could tell that a mayor is good if you get into the town
0:10:26.860000 - 0:10:33.940000::You can count and you know look at the amount of sidewalks in Chipotle's because we walked into this town right when we pulled in and the sidewalks
0:10:33.940000 - 0:10:39.660000::We're smoother than anything I've ever seen. Oh, there's certain portions that are gorgeous because you walk you drive in it's J crew
0:10:39.660000 - 0:10:46.520000::It's Nike outlet. Yeah, it's Chipotle. Yeah, it's Panera and we all think whatever. Oh, that's funny
0:10:46.520000 - 0:10:51.740000::Like only losers from the suburbs go to those places, but if those places are done right and they're designed
0:10:51.740000 - 0:10:53.740000::Uh, modern Lee
0:10:54.340000 - 0:10:57.400000::It's so inviting and it's so incredible and it makes for an amazing
0:10:58.300000 - 0:11:00.780000::Top of town not a night out of town
0:11:01.420000 - 0:11:06.820000::Whatever I'm saying we need a Chipotle sponsorship. We've mentioned Chipotle on every single podcast
0:11:06.820000 - 0:11:13.420000::I feel like we will in the future every single time and I guarantee you we have already made Chipotle as a corporation
0:11:13.420000 - 0:11:14.940000::Hell at least
0:11:14.940000 - 0:11:20.660000::56 dollars. Yeah, I swear to God because somebody has gone out on every single episode
0:11:20.660000 - 0:11:27.180000::We mentioned Chipotle in some way shape or form and somebody saying I need myself a fucking chicken burrito bowl right now

0:11:41.060000 - 0:11:49.140000::When they say do you want rice or beans say no, I want chip I want guacamole instead of rice instead of beans instead of chicken and
0:11:49.300000 - 0:11:57.380000::Get the most guac dob burrito that you possibly can and take a crazy photo and send it to us and we'll fucking repost it like guacarito
0:11:57.380000 - 0:11:59.380000::The guacarito
0:12:00.180000 - 0:12:02.180000::It's kind of like how like
0:12:02.620000 - 0:12:06.820000::You know people have their own McDonald's meal like what are the people have like yeah?
0:12:06.820000 - 0:12:08.820000::Yeah, yeah, the joy tactics Chipotle
0:12:08.820000 - 0:12:12.980000::Joy-tastic meal. Oh my god. I would die if I
0:12:14.740000 - 0:12:22.380000::Or or I will say this don't take a picture get that bitch fucking walked up and take it and fucking chuck it on something
0:12:22.580000 - 0:12:24.580000::Chuck it on the ground
0:12:24.980000 - 0:12:27.380000::I would just say that that would make a crazy splash
0:12:27.380000 - 0:12:29.380000::I usually so agreeable
0:12:37.580000 - 0:12:40.620000::We do gotta go back to the goodness about this is the right
0:12:40.620000 - 0:12:45.160000::Oh first of all let's go back to what's good about what's the most amazing thing about this city?
0:12:45.160000 - 0:12:51.660000::Yeah, what here we are sitting upon basically something that most modern most humans who've ever lived have never been able to be this high off a
0:12:51.660000 - 0:12:53.500000::Grand in their lives, so we're
0:12:55.100000 - 0:12:57.100000::We're 11 floors up
0:12:57.500000 - 0:13:02.860000::And listen to that by the way some rowdy people getting home from like some people who are having an amazing time
0:13:02.860000 - 0:13:04.860000::I guess all odds coming down the hallway
0:13:05.860000 - 0:13:11.540000::But what I'm saying is we're able to see the ocean from the height of a bird. How special is that?
0:13:11.940000 - 0:13:16.720000::We're inside you realize it's only been like I think we forget
0:13:17.220000 - 0:13:22.140000::I don't know people tune out when I go into this type of mode. I forgive you, but yeah
0:13:22.380000 - 0:13:26.180000::It's only been a hundred or so years since we've been able to build this high
0:13:26.180000 - 0:13:28.180000::I was just about to say the same as that
0:13:28.180000 - 0:13:30.520000::You know, you know, I mean what's the highest bill?
0:13:30.520000 - 0:13:33.820000::Well, what's the highest building in the lab? You know the 19th century?
0:13:34.100000 - 0:13:38.460000::Here is maybe maybe you could build them hell high, but I'm
0:13:38.980000 - 0:13:40.980000::Why but they're not
0:13:40.980000 - 0:13:45.820000::You have to be able to walk up all but we are we are definitely in the point zero zero zero zero
0:13:45.820000 - 0:13:51.140000::One percentile of humans to experience this high this high to be up this high and by the way
0:13:51.140000 - 0:13:53.140000::We've been on airplanes who is they couldn't ever imagine
0:13:53.500000 - 0:13:57.780000::Yeah, I was even higher than most of all buildings. All right. Well the goodness about it
0:13:58.020000 - 0:14:00.020000::Langston you're high up in the
0:14:00.340000 - 0:14:04.580000::And you know what I'll see this okay one great thing about Atlantic City is
0:14:05.260000 - 0:14:11.900000::When you're watching television you're on social media you are seeing the hottest fucking people on the planet
0:14:11.900000 - 0:14:13.900000::You're seeing good looking people
0:14:14.580000 - 0:14:18.420000::Everywhere you look and you're comparing yourself to them, but in Atlantic City
0:14:19.060000 - 0:14:21.060000::Everyone is kind of
0:14:21.060000 - 0:14:27.420000::Extremely ugly. No way that not sorry. I didn't mean that I didn't mean to say let me let me rewind that
0:14:29.540000 - 0:14:31.780000::They are just looking like
0:14:32.740000 - 0:14:34.740000::Themselves. Oh, yeah
0:14:35.380000 - 0:14:39.660000::I mean that they look real and then you look in the mirror and you see your flaws
0:14:39.660000 - 0:14:43.580000::I didn't know I was this good looking until I came to Atlantic City today
0:14:43.580000 - 0:14:47.180000::They'll be on some real shit. I was looking on the mirror and I was thinking
0:14:48.420000 - 0:14:50.420000::God like
0:14:52.140000 - 0:14:55.700000::What what man like I look so bad, you know me
0:14:55.700000 - 0:14:59.980000::No, and then I go out there on the floor and not that people are looking worse, but I'm

0:15:00 - 0:15:02.320000::I'm like, oh, I'm just a person.
0:15:02.320000 - 0:15:04.440000::And I might have some undiagnosed illness
0:15:04.440000 - 0:15:05.840000::that I don't know about, that's scaring me
0:15:05.840000 - 0:15:07.200000::and that's making me think I'm looking ugly
0:15:07.200000 - 0:15:08.200000::or that I should.
0:15:08.200000 - 0:15:10.720000::But so do all these people.
0:15:10.720000 - 0:15:13.520000::And so what's the, I mean, and these people,
0:15:13.520000 - 0:15:16.800000::some of them, can I say Eric, you, can I say,

0:15:18.560000 - 0:15:21.640000::DM Eric a compliment right now about him physically,
0:15:21.640000 - 0:15:23.640000::because he is one of the hottest guys
0:15:23.640000 - 0:15:24.960000::I've ever met in my life.
0:15:24.960000 - 0:15:28.880000::No, I'm not even trying to gas up a friend right now,
0:15:29.160000 - 0:15:29.960000::at all.
0:15:29.960000 - 0:15:32.920000::I'm saying this from an objective standpoint,
0:15:32.920000 - 0:15:36.240000::Eric is one of the hottest motherfuckers on planet earth.
0:15:36.240000 - 0:15:37.160000::And you know it.
0:15:37.160000 - 0:15:38.760000::And you know, if you've seen him,
0:15:38.760000 - 0:15:41.520000::if you've seen his look, he's got that look that,
0:15:41.520000 - 0:15:44.800000::stare that zoolander type, like special look
0:15:44.800000 - 0:15:47.360000::where it's like your face can kind of bend in a way
0:15:47.360000 - 0:15:48.720000::where it's like, oh, look at me.
0:15:48.720000 - 0:15:50.360000::Ha, ha, ha, I'm sexy.
0:15:50.360000 - 0:15:52.200000::Well, and Eric,
0:15:52.200000 - 0:15:53.200000::I appreciate it.
0:15:53.200000 - 0:15:56.920000::Yeah, and yet, and yet for somehow God has made you
0:15:56.920000 - 0:15:58.880000::also one of the most insecure people,
0:15:58.880000 - 0:16:01.920000::because he knew that if you weren't insecure, right.
0:16:01.920000 - 0:16:03.520000::If you weren't insecure,
0:16:03.520000 - 0:16:05.880000::that your power would be so strong,
0:16:05.880000 - 0:16:08.680000::that you would be out here basically dominating people
0:16:08.680000 - 0:16:11.360000::sexually, day after day after day after day.
0:16:11.360000 - 0:16:12.600000::So he's checked your ego,
0:16:12.600000 - 0:16:13.600000::like give me some more,
0:16:13.600000 - 0:16:14.440000::I'm right.
0:16:14.440000 - 0:16:15.680000::Oh, you see yourself as a couple of people.
0:16:15.680000 - 0:16:16.520000::You say insecure though,
0:16:16.520000 - 0:16:19.960000::but I'm like so barely insecure in that type of oil.
0:16:19.960000 - 0:16:23.760000::I am insecure about you can be honest around.
0:16:23.760000 - 0:16:24.600000::No, no, no.
0:16:24.600000 - 0:16:26.200000::No, I'm trying to flex for the podcast,
0:16:26.280000 - 0:16:27.880000::I'm not flexing someone's ear.
0:16:27.880000 - 0:16:29.240000::No, let me say this now.
0:16:29.240000 - 0:16:34.240000::I am insecure, but barely, barely insecure.
0:16:35.120000 - 0:16:37.360000::Only physically, now physically meant,
0:16:37.360000 - 0:16:39.920000::I'm gonna say this to people on the floor of a lens.
0:16:39.920000 - 0:16:40.760000::Okay.
0:16:42.720000 - 0:16:46::Nate, you may call them a glistening spot.
0:16:46 - 0:16:47.040000::Right, that's your priority.
0:16:47.040000 - 0:16:48.280000::Well, I took that back, but,
0:16:48.280000 - 0:16:49.120000::all right, okay.
0:16:49.120000 - 0:16:49.960000::But what about,
0:16:49.960000 - 0:16:51.040000::and you know, a paragon of means to it.
0:16:51.040000 - 0:16:52.360000::It's a Britney Spears song.
0:16:52.360000 - 0:16:53.360000::Well,
0:16:54.200000 - 0:16:56.480000::or maybe just city and Greek, Greece.
0:16:56.480000 - 0:16:57.800000::Paragraphy?
0:16:57.800000 - 0:16:59.800000::No, we gotta cut this out.
0:16:59.800000 - 0:17:00.920000::Anyways, let's cut this out.
0:17:00.920000 - 0:17:01.760000::It's embarrassing.
0:17:01.760000 - 0:17:02.600000::All right, let's go.
0:17:02.600000 - 0:17:03.680000::What are we talking about?
0:17:03.680000 - 0:17:05.720000::Oh, the people of Atlantic City who are more,
0:17:07.880000 - 0:17:12.680000::for every molecule that is not put into being gorgeous
0:17:12.680000 - 0:17:13.560000::and beautiful,
0:17:13.560000 - 0:17:15.400000::that's another molecule that you can tell
0:17:15.400000 - 0:17:17.360000::that they've dedicated to a skill.
0:17:17.360000 - 0:17:20.360000::So if you see a sexy motherfucker standing right
0:17:20.360000 - 0:17:22.360000::next to a ugly ass bastard,
0:17:22.360000 - 0:17:25.800000::you know that ugly fool can kill them, outrun them,
0:17:25.800000 - 0:17:29.760000::I'll work them, out in them, out speak them in language wise.
0:17:29.760000 - 0:17:31.840000::I'll say this, you said outrun.
0:17:31.840000 - 0:17:34.120000::I don't think there's a single person in Atlantic City
0:17:34.120000 - 0:17:37.080000::who can outrun me straight up.
0:17:37.080000 - 0:17:39.440000::I think I might be the fastest person in Atlantic City
0:17:39.440000 - 0:17:40.280000::on me right now.
0:17:40.280000 - 0:17:41.440000::Maybe you know what?
0:17:41.440000 - 0:17:42.960000::You might be like 95th person.
0:17:42.960000 - 0:17:43.800000::Just a little bit.
0:17:43.800000 - 0:17:45.840000::I didn't see some fate looking people out there.
0:17:45.840000 - 0:17:48.480000::I feel like the air was a little more dense to walk through
0:17:48.480000 - 0:17:50.160000::because if you looked around like we were,
0:17:50.160000 - 0:17:52.800000::I noticed we were walking slow as fuck at one point.
0:17:52.800000 - 0:17:53.640000::I was like, what the hell?
0:17:53.640000 - 0:17:54.800000::Oh, I see through these people.
0:17:54.800000 - 0:17:58.480000::People were walking like a hell slow.
0:17:58.480000 - 0:17:59.480000::They got nowhere to be.
0:17:59.480000 - 0:18:00.680000::That's a confident walk.
0:18:03.160000 - 0:18:05.440000::I heard someone talking on the escalator.
0:18:05.440000 - 0:18:07.960000::This is by the way, humans of New York,
0:18:07.960000 - 0:18:10.040000::why don't you make a humans of Atlantic City
0:18:10.040000 - 0:18:11.840000::and just ask you bull about all their day,
0:18:11.840000 - 0:18:13.400000::all their lives and stuff.
0:18:13.400000 - 0:18:16.080000::But I heard a guy talking to his girlfriend
0:18:16.080000 - 0:18:17.240000::and she looked kind of distracted
0:18:17.240000 - 0:18:19.040000::and didn't really want to hear what he was saying.
0:18:20.040000 - 0:18:22.400000::So yeah, she was just going to have to escalate her.
0:18:22.400000 - 0:18:23.240000::I don't know.
0:18:23.240000 - 0:18:24.440000::He was like, am I dead?
0:18:24.440000 - 0:18:26.480000::They were like shooting at my dad and like,
0:18:26.480000 - 0:18:29.240000::he said all his friends like shot back and they're like,
0:18:29.240000 - 0:18:31.720000::basically, it sounded like he was telling a story.
0:18:31.720000 - 0:18:34.160000::That's the only snippet I heard.
0:18:34.160000 - 0:18:37.400000::But in my mind, it was this like 43 year old guy
0:18:37.400000 - 0:18:42.400000::telling his girlfriend about his dad's Vietnam war stories.
0:18:42.480000 - 0:18:43.320000::Oh my God.
0:18:43.320000 - 0:18:45.840000::And to me that was a little bit funny for some reason
0:18:45.840000 - 0:18:47.480000::because the girlfriend did not give up.
0:18:48.320000 - 0:18:49.440000::They did not give him one phone.
0:18:49.440000 - 0:18:51.920000::Why don't girlfriends give a fuck about war?
0:18:51.920000 - 0:18:52.760000::I don't.
0:18:52.760000 - 0:18:53.760000::They do, they just don't.
0:18:53.760000 - 0:18:55.400000::No, that is so interesting.
0:18:55.400000 - 0:18:57.360000::Girlfriends, all for an insecure.
0:18:57.360000 - 0:18:59.200000::Does it make your partner insecure
0:18:59.200000 - 0:19:01.400000::for you to talk about a war that they weren't a part of?
0:19:01.400000 - 0:19:05.120000::How can we make war fun for the GFs out there?
0:19:05.120000 - 0:19:06.440000::Or the BFs?
0:19:06.440000 - 0:19:07.440000::Or the BS?
0:19:07.440000 - 0:19:09.160000::Are you, your partner is a part of the party?
0:19:09.160000 - 0:19:10.960000::Your partner that is not into war.
0:19:10.960000 - 0:19:13.280000::How can we make war a little bit more fun for them
0:19:13.280000 - 0:19:14.680000::and a little bit more enticing?
0:19:14.680000 - 0:19:17.200000::Well, you used to think about war.
0:19:17.200000 - 0:19:19.440000::When you've been through it, no.
0:19:19.440000 - 0:19:20.440000::It's not fun.
0:19:20.440000 - 0:19:23::You don't want to see video games about it, whatever.
0:19:23 - 0:19:24.720000::But once it's been about 30 years,
0:19:24.720000 - 0:19:26.880000::then it becomes kind of, then that becomes fun.
0:19:26.880000 - 0:19:27.720000::Schmecksy.
0:19:27.720000 - 0:19:28.560000::Because the people don't really exist
0:19:28.560000 - 0:19:30.560000::in the same way in people's minds anymore.
0:19:30.560000 - 0:19:34.040000::They become ponds and like almost like it's a video game.
0:19:34.040000 - 0:19:36.920000::That's what you know something about ponds, right?
0:19:36.920000 - 0:19:37.760000::What?
0:19:37.760000 - 0:19:39.600000::PAWM.
0:19:39.600000 - 0:19:40.600000::A Ponds.
0:19:40.600000 - 0:19:41.600000::Ponds.
0:19:41.600000 - 0:19:42.600000::A P-D-A.
0:19:42.600000 - 0:19:46.640000::Ponds can be more dangerous than a queen.
0:19:46.640000 - 0:19:49.960000::Because a queen has numbers.
0:19:49.960000 - 0:19:51.640000::Well, queen only has mobility.
0:19:51.640000 - 0:19:53.360000::But guess what?
0:19:53.360000 - 0:19:55.360000::If you can move around it as a matter of your surrounded
0:19:55.360000 - 0:19:59.120000::by enemies, because you'll just keep running to walls.
0:19:59.120000 - 0:20:01.040000::Did you guys know that?

0:20:00 - 0:20:10.200000::my grandfather fought in World War II. No. He was out of fog. He, well he was
0:20:10.200000 - 0:20:14.400000::basically forced to write a book about his World War II experience.
0:20:14.400000 - 0:20:20.220000::Have I talked about this? Forced book writing? He, my aunt was like I want you
0:20:20.220000 - 0:20:25.760000::to write about your experiences in the World War II. He's in World War II and
0:20:25.760000 - 0:20:32.320000::he was, he witnessed the Iwo Jima. You know that famous slag being hoisted up in
0:20:32.320000 - 0:20:36.920000::Iwo Jima? He was right in the background watching that happen. What the hell?
0:20:36.920000 - 0:20:42.320000::What's he doing there? He drove boats. He was like driving people into shore
0:20:42.320000 - 0:20:48.400000::soldiers and I read his account of being involved in World War II and he was like
0:20:48.400000 - 0:20:54.600000::oh my god. In the Pacific Islands region for I think a couple of years or
0:20:54.600000 - 0:20:59.960000::something like maybe one year or so. But he was like every single night was
0:20:59.960000 - 0:21:05.600000::awful. Every single night you thought am I going to die? Is there, am I going to
0:21:05.600000 - 0:21:09.400000::be called into battle? Is there going to be an airstrike or something like that?
0:21:09.400000 - 0:21:16::Is there going to be, it was, it was the most highly, high anxiety state of mind to
0:21:16 - 0:21:19.720000::be in and he was like in the beginning of the book he was like war is
0:21:19.720000 - 0:21:24.280000::fucking hell. Like is the worst thing that you can possibly experience as a human
0:21:24.280000 - 0:21:29.800000::being and it was the it was the I was like oh my god. This is somebody I've known
0:21:29.800000 - 0:21:36.480000::my whole life and somebody that has you know influenced me and and is such a
0:21:36.480000 - 0:21:40.360000::great person I've known. He's dead now by the way. Rest in peace. Rest in peace.
0:21:40.360000 - 0:21:51.840000::RIP John John Maroon and I was like man like war really is hell. Hell on fucking
0:21:51.840000 - 0:21:57.840000::earth. And you see it on and before that I was like before I read that account I
0:21:57.840000 - 0:22:02.440000::was like you know just so far removed from war that I was like you know I can
0:22:02.440000 - 0:22:07.640000::make fun of it and and talk about you know the record and whatnot it's fun to
0:22:07.640000 - 0:22:12.360000::joke about it and I was like damn like this shit it happened to my grandfather
0:22:12.360000 - 0:22:16.760000::and he was traumatized for the rest of his life about this shit like this
0:22:16.760000 - 0:22:22.320000::shit ain't no joke and we're three's coming up and a whole new generation is
0:22:22.320000 - 0:22:26.360000::about to experience this type of shit in a crazy and away.
0:22:26.360000 - 0:22:30.640000::Why do you know it's funny to me about not so funny because nothing about war is
0:22:30.640000 - 0:22:36.160000::funny except for maybe some of the names of the names of the Spawns or battles
0:22:36.160000 - 0:22:44.440000::but if we if our kids go to World War 3 but we're too old to fight we are
0:22:44.440000 - 0:22:51.680000::gonna be seen as the softest Gen Z and my no I think unless Gen Z is no no the
0:22:51.680000 - 0:22:57.400000::generation after Gen Z about to be the hardest Gen Alpha is about to be scar
0:22:57.400000 - 0:23:01.640000::across the fucking slash across the face yeah everybody kind of has like red
0:23:01.640000 - 0:23:06.760000::Mohawk hair and they'll have like some twisted ass facial like they have
0:23:06.760000 - 0:23:10.400000::something fucked up where they have like no arm or something like that but they
0:23:10.400000 - 0:23:15.200000::have some crazy ass claw like like click stuff it's got the fingers that click
0:23:15.200000 - 0:23:23.240000::click like like upright hella fast trigger holding on yeah that's it
0:23:23.240000 - 0:23:26.680000::that generation you should be afraid of they're gonna look at us and think we
0:23:26.680000 - 0:23:30.360000::are the doughiest softest round on the middle of the generation that's ever
0:23:30.360000 - 0:23:35.480000::existed because we whatever we grew up on scrubs in the Simpsons and liberal art
0:23:35.480000 - 0:23:42.760000::we are just you know I mean we we need to see some well and I'm speaking
0:23:42.760000 - 0:23:48.640000::from obviously perspective of a you know who we are and so we haven't had
0:23:48.640000 - 0:23:52.100000::it at our but maybe other people have so maybe this is ignorant well what's
0:23:52.100000 - 0:23:57.380000::wrong what's wrong with being soft what's wrong that's true because hold on
0:23:57.380000 - 0:24:00.880000::to saying that true what's true what I think about something hard when I think
0:24:00.880000 - 0:24:04.560000::about something I'm gonna crack my tooth on something I'm gonna hit my head
0:24:04.560000 - 0:24:08.320000::on when I think it's something soft I think that's I think right that's what I'm
0:24:08.320000 - 0:24:15.600000::in fiction what soft hmm no you think about gums maybe you gum disease well
0:24:15.600000 - 0:24:18.240000::what I'm saying is when I think about something soft I think about something
0:24:18.240000 - 0:24:23.800000::that I want to keep around me look look you know everything in this room that we
0:24:23.800000 - 0:24:28.640000::want close to us is soft things that are hard things that are hard in they're
0:24:28.640000 - 0:24:35.200000::rotten they're they smell bad they got bad attitudes they break under pressure
0:24:35.200000 - 0:24:40.240000::by the way something soft you can push into them and they shape differently
0:24:40.240000 - 0:24:45.800000::that's a good argument right right so I'm a little bit over people saying oh
0:24:45.800000 - 0:24:50::this is the softest generation but really what they're doing is they're
0:24:50 - 0:24:58.320000::revealing themselves to be fools what we're doing is comparing ourselves to you
0:24:58.320000 - 0:25:01.720000::know I don't even know where I'm going

0:25:00 - 0:25:05.880000::this, but like we're comparing ourselves to a violent thing that is war. You know what I'm
0:25:05.880000 - 0:25:09.680000::saying? And it's not normal. I mean, it is normal, but it's not the same time.
0:25:09.680000 - 0:25:13.520000::Because it used to be normal to beat the fuck out of each other was basically money. But
0:25:13.520000 - 0:25:19.120000::once money stopped being violence, now we are finally able to unlock different realms
0:25:19.120000 - 0:25:20.120000::of humanity.
0:25:20.120000 - 0:25:26.120000::Can we go a thousand years without a war and then have a generation and then have a generation?
0:25:26.120000 - 0:25:31.360000::We all just be like for the next thousand years, I don't think that's not hard to do. A thousand
0:25:31.360000 - 0:25:39.880000::year rule and then have that in the, you know, the 3000, whatever, you know, that generation
0:25:39.880000 - 0:25:42.480000::will have no fucking idea even how to fight a war.
0:25:42.480000 - 0:25:43.480000::Oh, that'll be so funny.
0:25:43.480000 - 0:25:50.600000::No, we just know because we saw the news today about the silver balloon.
0:25:50.600000 - 0:25:51.600000::Silver balloon.
0:25:51.600000 - 0:25:53.600000::It's not a blue balloon.
0:25:53.600000 - 0:25:57.840000::It's basically a alien, a blue car shape, whatever some over a last.
0:25:57.840000 - 0:25:58.840000::Car size.
0:25:58.840000 - 0:26:04.760000::Okay, now like the run we've got car shape.
0:26:04.760000 - 0:26:05.760000::Chamber of sh**.
0:26:05.760000 - 0:26:06.760000::Yeah.
0:26:06.760000 - 0:26:11.960000::Like a rap or a 20 2001 rap, but I'm saying there are powers that people are getting around
0:26:11.960000 - 0:26:14.040000::a rap format of human alien skin.
0:26:14.040000 - 0:26:15.520000::That was floating in the sky.
0:26:15.520000 - 0:26:18::What's up Eric?
0:26:18 - 0:26:19.680000::I'm so sorry to interrupt you like that.
0:26:19.680000 - 0:26:23.720000::I just the idea of it's hard even upset about the inner or organic skin.
0:26:23.720000 - 0:26:24.720000::All right, go ahead.
0:26:24.720000 - 0:26:29.160000::No, I'm thinking what's happening is I'm thinking about that car with a skin and what we can
0:26:29.160000 - 0:26:30.160000::move off from it.
0:26:30.160000 - 0:26:35.520000::But I'm just saying, if we forget to fight, violence is how we evolved.
0:26:35.520000 - 0:26:41.440000::If we weren't a violent species, we would have been left in the fucking ocean being amoeba's.
0:26:41.440000 - 0:26:44.800000::We made a passive, a violent evolution.
0:26:44.800000 - 0:26:49.240000::We need to just admit right now that we wouldn't be where we are right now without a little
0:26:49.240000 - 0:26:50.240000::bit of violence.
0:26:50.240000 - 0:26:51.920000::That's just a hard fact.
0:26:51.920000 - 0:26:56.600000::I'm just, it's a hard fact, weirdly, and it's fucked up and it's complex.
0:26:56.600000 - 0:26:59.040000::And the, we're violent creatures.
0:26:59.040000 - 0:27:00.040000::We're violent creatures.
0:27:00.040000 - 0:27:02::It's kind of like this.
0:27:02 - 0:27:03::You guys know about Pokemon?
0:27:03 - 0:27:04::Oh, from where?
0:27:04 - 0:27:05::So from where?
0:27:05 - 0:27:08.480000::The level is one through 24 of humanity essentially.
0:27:08.480000 - 0:27:11.440000::Humans, their main attack thing was violence, right?
0:27:11.440000 - 0:27:12.440000::That was right.
0:27:12.440000 - 0:27:13.960000::They had five of violence's.
0:27:13.960000 - 0:27:15.440000::Yeah, but now guess what?
0:27:15.440000 - 0:27:21.960000::I have a theory that humans are now from Charmander to Charmelingon where violence is no longer
0:27:21.960000 - 0:27:23.440000::our strongest move.
0:27:23.440000 - 0:27:24.440000::No, no.
0:27:24.440000 - 0:27:25.440000::No, it's not.
0:27:25.440000 - 0:27:27.400000::Because if somebody is violent, what do we do with that?
0:27:27.400000 - 0:27:29.640000::We either put them on TV or put them in a prison.
0:27:29.640000 - 0:27:31.640000::So now we're both.
0:27:31.640000 - 0:27:33.640000::It's archaic.
0:27:33.640000 - 0:27:34.640000::It's archaic.
0:27:34.640000 - 0:27:41.640000::What we're doing is phase two and what's phase three being hell spiritual means phase
0:27:41.640000 - 0:27:43.920000::three and a sort of a lot of just deconstruction.
0:27:43.920000 - 0:27:44.920000::Everything.
0:27:44.920000 - 0:27:47.080000::Phase three is when we realize we're not people.
0:27:47.080000 - 0:27:48.680000::We're not even people.
0:27:48.680000 - 0:27:50.200000::You know what's interesting to me though, right?
0:27:50.200000 - 0:27:55.240000::Is that we have evolved as a society, but our brains haven't evolved.
0:27:55.240000 - 0:27:56.240000::No, size wise.
0:27:56.240000 - 0:27:57.240000::Is that what you mean?
0:27:57.240000 - 0:28:02.200000::No, I mean, like, I mean, nature wise.
0:28:02.200000 - 0:28:06.120000::So a pair of beautiful twins, whatever.
0:28:06.120000 - 0:28:07.120000::Twin.
0:28:07.120000 - 0:28:08.120000::Twin, amazing twins.
0:28:08.120000 - 0:28:10.120000::Some of the best ones you've ever seen.
0:28:10.120000 - 0:28:15.520000::You can separate them at birth and one gets thrown into the fucking wilderness, hunger
0:28:15.520000 - 0:28:18.440000::games, whatever they have to fight as a baby.
0:28:18.440000 - 0:28:23.500000::And the other one is thrown into whatever ox, ox, ox, ox, ox, ox, ox, ox, ox, ox, ox,

0:29:12.820000 - 0:29:14.400000::right, right, right,

0:29:16.860000 - 0:29:17.900000::But back to it,
0:29:17.900000 - 0:29:18.900000::okay, back to everyone.
0:29:18.900000 - 0:29:22.700000::But even here, fucking had to fight to the death to get a million dollars.
0:29:23.540000 - 0:29:26.520000::If they said you've got to kill five people to get a million dollars,
0:29:26.520000 - 0:29:28.360000::there would be hundreds of bodies downstairs.
0:29:28.360000 - 0:29:31.120000::Oh, oh, oh, easily.
0:29:31.120000 - 0:29:33.520000::People, and by the way, no jail time.
0:29:35.440000 - 0:29:39.120000::We are the only people in this city right now without guns on us.
0:29:39.120000 - 0:29:40.520000::Oh, 100%.
0:29:40.520000 - 0:29:41.720000::We need to get weapons.
0:29:41.720000 - 0:29:44.400000::No, should we get a joy tactics weapon?
0:29:44.400000 - 0:29:45.600000::One joy tactics gun.
0:29:45.600000 - 0:29:47.960000::We need, okay, if you're, if you're listening to this,
0:29:47.960000 - 0:29:50.720000::and this is like a, you know,

0:37:31.520000 - 0:37:34.120000::It's not looking too good because what did I buy?
0:37:34.120000 - 0:37:38.160000::A blue Yeti mic turns out that mic doesn't even work.
0:37:38.160000 - 0:37:39.320000::That's a bad mic.
0:37:39.320000 - 0:37:42::And so you are ever listening to this podcast and you're like,
0:37:42 - 0:37:44.440000::man, the audio sounds trash.
0:37:44.440000 - 0:37:48.720000::The fucking social media marketing is fucking wack.
0:37:48.720000 - 0:37:53.640000::Like we don't know what the fuck we are fucking doing.
0:37:53.640000 - 0:37:54.640000::I would say this is the thing.
0:37:54.640000 - 0:37:57.960000::We don't know what we're doing at all in the slightest, dude.
0:37:57.960000 - 0:38:00.200000::This has been harder than I ever could have imagined
0:38:00.200000 - 0:38:01.520000::in every single component.
0:38:01.520000 - 0:38:04.400000::Talking at all is really fucking hard.
0:38:04.400000 - 0:38:04.920000::I know.
0:38:04.920000 - 0:38:06.960000::Literally talking is so difficult.
0:38:06.960000 - 0:38:07.960000::I had no idea.
0:38:07.960000 - 0:38:11.120000::It's just having to have then the audio's way
0:38:11.120000 - 0:38:12.120000::fucking harder than I thought.
0:38:12.120000 - 0:38:13.520000::Every single audio's so busted.
0:38:13.520000 - 0:38:15.120000::Every single component.
0:38:15.120000 - 0:38:16.120000::Every single component.
0:38:16.120000 - 0:38:19.360000::The audio has been so busted, the fuck up.
0:38:19.360000 - 0:38:21.560000::And I want to thank everybody for listening right now
0:38:21.560000 - 0:38:24.840000::for rocking with us through the bust of the audio.
0:38:24.840000 - 0:38:26.800000::Through the waves of this.
0:38:26.800000 - 0:38:30.080000::But I think also at the same time, people
0:38:30.080000 - 0:38:32.600000::are listening to all this polish shit.
0:38:32.600000 - 0:38:34.440000::And you know how people like polished.
0:38:34.440000 - 0:38:36.920000::People are listening to polished shit.
0:38:36.920000 - 0:38:39.760000::You know why there is a resurgence of people
0:38:39.760000 - 0:38:42.800000::that want to shoot stuff on film.
0:38:42.800000 - 0:38:46.320000::And use that Kodak fucking 250D.
0:38:46.320000 - 0:38:48.200000::Like that grain on it.
0:38:48.200000 - 0:38:50.560000::And there's grain on this puck.
0:38:50.560000 - 0:38:52.240000::And there's a little bit of grain.
0:38:52.240000 - 0:38:53.720000::There's a little bit of noise.
0:38:53.720000 - 0:38:56.080000::Because you want to see the imperfections.
0:38:56.080000 - 0:39:00.400000::And the eye that you, when you're seeing something,
0:39:00.400000 - 0:39:02.600000::there are imperfections in what you see.
0:39:02.600000 - 0:39:03.760000::And you don't want to see something
0:39:03.760000 - 0:39:07.080000::like an 8K digital crazy 3D.
0:39:07.080000 - 0:39:08.880000::It's just too perfect.
0:39:08.880000 - 0:39:09.800000::It looks weird.
0:39:09.800000 - 0:39:11.080000::We do it dirty style.
0:39:11.080000 - 0:39:13.080000::We do this shit dirty style.
0:39:13.080000 - 0:39:14.080000::We do this more.
0:39:14.080000 - 0:39:16.360000::You like this podcast a little bit dirty, don't you?
0:39:16.360000 - 0:39:18.320000::And you don't want it to get a little bit clean.
0:39:18.320000 - 0:39:19.080000::All right.
0:39:19.080000 - 0:39:20.080000::And you like the way?
0:39:20.080000 - 0:39:24.400000::You want us to get a little dirty early.
0:39:24.400000 - 0:39:26.880000::And you like how we kind of dip into different voices.
0:39:26.880000 - 0:39:29.240000::And you're never quite sure what we mean.
0:39:29.240000 - 0:39:30.240000::That's intended.
0:39:30.240000 - 0:39:31.080000::Right.
0:39:31.080000 - 0:39:31.920000::You should know.
0:39:31.920000 - 0:39:32.760000::We don't even always know.
0:39:32.760000 - 0:39:34.240000::We don't know who we are.
0:39:34.240000 - 0:39:35.680000::And I don't want to know.
0:39:35.680000 - 0:39:36.560000::I'm not interested.
0:39:36.560000 - 0:39:37.280000::Because guess what?
0:39:37.280000 - 0:39:38.480000::Humans are not anything.
0:39:38.480000 - 0:39:40.640000::People want to put label on this label on that.
0:39:40.640000 - 0:39:42.960000::Labels are for products and items in the grocery store.
0:39:42.960000 - 0:39:43.480000::Correct.
0:39:43.480000 - 0:39:45.600000::Human beings are constantly changing.
0:39:45.600000 - 0:39:48.560000::And the second you label one, they just
0:39:48.560000 - 0:39:50.560000::change into something else right before your eyes.
0:39:50.560000 - 0:39:51.400000::Hey, you know what?
0:39:51.400000 - 0:39:53.600000::I want to see more labels on everything.
0:39:53.600000 - 0:39:55.280000::I want to see what you got.
0:39:55.280000 - 0:39:58.800000::We're just, we're in the generation of labeling more stuff,

0:40:00 - 0:40:03.140000::different types of diseases are coming up and you know what I'm saying?
0:40:03.140000 - 0:40:04.900000::I want to see like let's go hard.
0:40:04.900000 - 0:40:07.380000::Let's get all the labels out in the next couple of years.
0:40:07.380000 - 0:40:08.640000::BABY BABY BABY!
0:40:08.640000 - 0:40:12.300000::Like and then let's cap it and then we'll say no more labels.
0:40:12.300000 - 0:40:13.300000::No more anything.
0:40:13.300000 - 0:40:18.680000::But for the next four or five years I want to see mother fuckers just coming up with labels
0:40:18.680000 - 0:40:23.140000::that like don't even need that be existing.
0:40:23.140000 - 0:40:25.780000::You know like we're trying to think of a label.
0:40:25.780000 - 0:40:29.060000::So you're saying these three fingers no one's ever labeled these.
0:40:29.060000 - 0:40:30.060000::Yeah yeah yeah.

0:41:10.540000 - 0:41:12.100000::Oh this is what I want to say.
0:41:12.100000 - 0:41:13.580000::We're going labels.
0:41:13.580000 - 0:41:17.060000::I'm interested in the four years when this theoretical point hits.
0:41:17.060000 - 0:41:18.060000::Yeah.
0:41:18.060000 - 0:41:20.340000::What's the first disease that's going to come out that we're not going to have that
0:41:20.340000 - 0:41:21.340000::we're not labeling.
0:41:21.340000 - 0:41:22.340000::Oh yeah.
0:41:22.340000 - 0:41:23.340000::Oh that's entitled.

0:41:24.340000 - 0:41:30.940000::That's the one where you yeah your throat hurts but then you get all.
0:41:30.940000 - 0:41:33.940000::You get all type of cuts randomly over your body.
0:41:33.940000 - 0:41:35.100000::That would suck.
0:41:35.100000 - 0:41:38.180000::If you start looking at your arm it starts cutting open.
0:41:38.180000 - 0:41:41.580000::I'm not looking at a visible knife cutting you a little bit.
0:41:41.580000 - 0:41:42.580000::No thanks.
0:41:42.580000 - 0:41:43.580000::It's different.
0:41:43.580000 - 0:41:46.580000::Why do I think of this stuff man?
0:41:46.580000 - 0:41:48.620000::Why am I able to think of stuff that is so.
0:41:48.620000 - 0:41:49.620000::I don't know.
0:41:49.620000 - 0:41:54.300000::Do you ever think there is a demon swirling around your head like a fucking chicken.
0:41:54.300000 - 0:41:55.780000::It'll soup his chicken.
0:41:55.780000 - 0:42:02.420000::If it is a demon like get out now or actually I don't know because I kind of almost like
0:42:02.420000 - 0:42:03.420000::being dark.
0:42:03.420000 - 0:42:04.420000::Right.
0:42:04.420000 - 0:42:07.980000::It's like I kind of like the demons I like the dark is.
0:42:07.980000 - 0:42:12.860000::The access memories and futures and instances that are going to like shock people.
0:42:12.860000 - 0:42:14.540000::He was listening but they're not real.
0:42:14.540000 - 0:42:15.540000::Don't worry.
0:42:15.540000 - 0:42:22.260000::They're not really yet but one day Eric might get bored and he might see something sharp
0:42:22.260000 - 0:42:25.740000::and you might meet us a little bit close by.
0:42:25.740000 - 0:42:29.500000::Let's just say he might put a butterfly knife up your fucking neck.
0:42:29.500000 - 0:42:34.260000::Make you look like a fucking, they have beef sausage on the side of the street.
0:42:34.260000 - 0:42:37.100000::Do you know the first time I ever saw a butterfly knife?
0:42:37.100000 - 0:42:43.620000::This sounds like a fake story but I went to a, I was very sheltered went to a Christian
0:42:43.620000 - 0:42:46.260000::school K through 8.
0:42:46.260000 - 0:42:47.260000::Very evangelical.
0:42:47.260000 - 0:42:51.180000::Super censored like they would, you could read Harry Potter at school.
0:42:51.180000 - 0:42:53.420000::None of this.
0:42:53.420000 - 0:42:59.020000::And then I went to public school for high school and one of my, and I tested into some not
0:42:59.020000 - 0:43:07.220000::better AP classes, whatever for other subjects but I was in also remedial math and just remedial
0:43:07.220000 - 0:43:08.220000::ball.
0:43:08.220000 - 0:43:10.220000::I don't know for this video it was like bottom level.
0:43:10.220000 - 0:43:11.220000::Like this one below.
0:43:11.220000 - 0:43:12.220000::I did that too.
0:43:12.220000 - 0:43:14.220000::I was one below.
0:43:14.220000 - 0:43:16.140000::I was so fucking bad at math.
0:43:16.140000 - 0:43:20.580000::But that was maybe my second class at public high school which was terrifying because I
0:43:20.580000 - 0:43:24.900000::had gone from the school about 200 people to a school of 4,500.
0:43:24.900000 - 0:43:29.540000::And it was a busting and honestly this is a true story.
0:43:29.540000 - 0:43:33.820000::On the first day of secondary school I was wearing card draw shorts and someone with
0:43:33.820000 - 0:43:35.900000::a white there come on my shorts.
0:43:35.900000 - 0:43:36.900000::Oh my god.
0:43:36.900000 - 0:43:37.900000::What is that?
0:43:37.900000 - 0:43:46.780000::I'm in my math class and the way that I remember it is like it's like all the kind of
0:43:46.780000 - 0:43:47.780000::bad kids.
0:43:47.780000 - 0:43:53.420000::Some of them are kind of bad kids and there's a girl that's drinking vodka out of a like
0:43:53.420000 - 0:43:59.620000::a bicycle, you know like a bike squeeze water bottle.
0:43:59.620000 - 0:44:01.820000::And she's drinking it out of there and I'm going what the fuck.
0:44:01.820000 - 0:44:06.020000::And then there's this other guy that has I've ever like some kids some scars on his hands
0:44:06.020000 - 0:44:10.140000::and I'm seeing her drink vodka out of a water bottle and then he literally says you want
0:44:10.140000 - 0:44:13.620000::to see some and he pulls out a butterfly.
0:44:13.620000 - 0:44:17.940000::And one of those kind of what do you call it where it's like all different type of colors?
0:44:17.940000 - 0:44:18.940000::Rainbow.
0:44:18.940000 - 0:44:19.940000::Yeah, rainbow.
0:44:19.940000 - 0:44:20.940000::Oily metal.
0:44:20.940000 - 0:44:21.940000::Oily metal.
0:44:21.940000 - 0:44:22.940000::I don't know.
0:44:22.940000 - 0:44:23.940000::Yeah, you know I'm talking about oil metal oil.
0:44:23.940000 - 0:44:24.940000::Oh, I get yeah.
0:44:24.940000 - 0:44:27.940000::Yeah, butterfly knife and he's showing me it.
0:44:27.940000 - 0:44:28.940000::And I think I can't.
0:44:28.940000 - 0:44:29.940000::Where's the come.
0:44:29.940000 - 0:44:30.940000::Yeah that's crazy man.
0:44:30.940000 - 0:44:31.940000::So go back to that.
0:44:31.940000 - 0:44:33.940000::So someone nut on your legs.
0:44:33.940000 - 0:44:35.940000::So that same guy with the butterfly knife he showed you.
0:44:35.940000 - 0:44:42.380000::I don't know if anybody legit did this but I remember I'm sitting down in a history
0:44:42.380000 - 0:44:43.380000::class.
0:44:43.380000 - 0:44:44.380000::It's like my first week at school.
0:44:44.380000 - 0:44:45.380000::Yeah, boys are so.
0:44:45.380000 - 0:44:53.500000::I feel so wet on my on my shorts and it just looks like you him.
0:44:53.500000 - 0:44:56.500000::I can't believe that.
0:44:56.500000 - 0:45:00.020000::It's not very

0:45:00 - 0:45:05.180000::But I remember going like what the fuck at what point did you go this I can't
0:45:06.400000 - 0:45:08.400000::Tell anybody no
0:45:08.800000 - 0:45:13.800000::Because I didn't suspect anybody I didn't feel anybody wipe it up upon me
0:45:13.800000 - 0:45:16.920000::It just mysteriously the the mystery nut
0:45:18.120000 - 0:45:20.360000::Up at night that night be like what was that liquid?
0:45:21.680000 - 0:45:26.540000::I just have always blindly believed that it was wasn't that night I
0:45:26.540000 - 0:45:28.540000::I believe you I
0:45:29.260000 - 0:45:34.420000::Looking at white gooey and stick to the show there I feel like there was always like lore of like
0:45:34.700000 - 0:45:38.600000::Some kid in like a class or detention was like yo
0:45:38.600000 - 0:45:44.740000::He jacked off in class and like no that's in his shorts or something like that like there was always like somebody
0:45:45.140000 - 0:45:50.140000::There was somebody like that had done that that was like in my grade
0:45:57.140000 - 0:45:59.140000::Boys are so disgusting
0:45:59.140000 - 0:46:03.460000::So if I have a kid I'm gonna make them look where a fucking bow tie to class every day
0:46:03.620000 - 0:46:11.700000::But you know, but you know why they're so disgusting and nasty is because we like repressed we repressed the sexuality of
0:46:12.660000 - 0:46:16.240000::The parents do and I feel like I was very much
0:46:16.940000 - 0:46:23.120000::Be religious being sexually repressed whatever but you think sex is something in your body in
0:46:24 - 0:46:29.980000::Your your physical body is something you should be ashamed of your penis your balls whatever
0:46:32.480000 - 0:46:38.200000::Which I was not even funny, but I think that there should be a different type of relationship that that
0:46:38.720000 - 0:46:44.040000::Parents have and whatever when you're growing up you should be like you know you have these parts of your body
0:46:44.040000 - 0:46:47.720000::And this is what they do and be open about it
0:46:47.720000 - 0:46:50.560000::And I think there would be just way less repression
0:46:50.560000 - 0:46:52.560000::Oh way less nut
0:46:52.560000 - 0:46:54.560000::I'm by nothing
0:46:54.560000 - 0:47:01.840000::But I find nothing you know what I don't want to put my dad on last in case he ever ever would listen to this but
0:47:02.480000 - 0:47:06.640000::He said he has oh he said he had I mean he has I don't know if you'd listen to this
0:47:06.640000 - 0:47:13.440000::Oh, but the way that I remember him tell me what sex was we were on our way to go snowboarding and
0:47:14.480000 - 0:47:18.360000::That we were an age I really get a guess this is asked me like how would you look?
0:47:18.360000 - 0:47:23.120000::I made traffic jam and I feel like my mom had been like you got to tell her the sex talk
0:47:23.120000 - 0:47:27.960000::And so and it wasn't even a complete like telling it just was like
0:47:28.320000 - 0:47:36.200000::Our dogs name was Mickey Mickey at the time win Terry and he would get the dog winners and he would my dad was like you know and Mickey's
0:47:38.040000 - 0:47:42.600000::Like thing. It's all red. Oh my god in the and he
0:47:43.640000 - 0:47:47.520000::As I remember it maybe I just was too embarrassed and I shut up shut it all out
0:47:47.520000 - 0:47:50.280000::But as I remember he didn't really expand too much upon
0:47:51.520000 - 0:47:54.880000::That statement he just told you he just explained dog boners
0:47:56.400000 - 0:47:58.400000::Essentially all right for what I remember
0:47:58.400000 - 0:48:00.400000::That's like it. That's a good intro
0:48:02.800000 - 0:48:10.240000::Nothing's more than I guess I guess it's like okay. This is not Mickey is a dog. He's nature and we're natural too kind of through Mickey
0:48:10.240000 - 0:48:12.240000::Into the bus
0:48:12.240000 - 0:48:16.800000::I saw a dog commit suicide. Are you serious? No, I don't know
0:48:17.440000 - 0:48:25.760000::We've gone and wait, please all right. We're weaving in and out of sexuality death the the topics that
0:48:25.840000 - 0:48:29.720000::There's so talk to like people are saying like what's the meaning of life?
0:48:29.720000 - 0:48:34.720000::And these are the number one things that bubble up to the surface is sex death
0:48:36.240000 - 0:48:41.840000::finances family finances family power power health
0:48:42.640000 - 0:48:44.640000::Well, what how did you see this dog die?
0:48:46.160000 - 0:48:47.840000::Chicago
0:48:48 - 0:48:51.440000::Third story window across the street. I don't want to hear this. I don't want to
0:48:51.440000 - 0:48:56.800000::Should we just cut it right cut cut cut this story? We don't want to hear that we don't want to hear this dog
0:48:56.800000 - 0:48:58.800000::I'm not gonna say it. I'll just say this
0:49:00.080000 - 0:49:03.040000::You think but I do think it's important to say this okay
0:49:04.080000 - 0:49:07.920000::You think that humans are the only living beings that experience
0:49:08.480000 - 0:49:09.440000::depression
0:49:09.440000 - 0:49:10.880000::Horror
0:49:10.880000 - 0:49:15.520000::Beyond what they think mortality can can can consume me whatever do to know
0:49:16.960000 - 0:49:21.760000::All living organisms have a threshold that they are willing to take
0:49:22.880000 - 0:49:28.640000::That's so and if trees had guns let's just say the rainforest wouldn't be so big because they would probably do it to themselves too
0:49:29.680000 - 0:49:32.320000::If I'm not saying that's what the dog did but right
0:49:32.720000 - 0:49:36.480000::Just some of the reason I'd guns I would be fucking dead right now. Oh
0:49:45.520000 - 0:49:49.200000::I had to just go after watching lower the rings let go kind of gambling style
0:49:53.520000 - 0:49:58.720000::Yeah, it's my friends house. We would slash that shit up with knives because parents forget to divorce and they're moving out

0:56:24 - 0:56:25::I can't believe that.
0:56:25 - 0:56:27::I was crazy about that.
0:56:27 - 0:56:28::That's what I'm going to do.
0:56:28 - 0:56:29::I'm going to print calling.
0:56:29 - 0:56:31::And you're in the room with a print call.
0:56:31 - 0:56:33::A lot of times you would get this feeling like,
0:56:33 - 0:56:34::Oh, I don't want to be here.
0:56:34 - 0:56:37::But when that was going on, I was like...

0:56:40 - 0:56:42::That's the nature of the faint call.
0:56:42 - 0:56:44::And hopefully that translates through the mic as well.
0:56:44 - 0:56:50::We'll beep out the names of these places because we don't want to even bring any iron
0:56:50 - 0:56:52::or any bad attention then.

0:57:05 - 0:57:06::Oh, of course.
0:57:06 - 0:57:07::I think that we should get...

0:57:48 - 0:57:50::Fuck you, they're so fucking...
0:57:50 - 0:57:54::Everybody is so in the weeds right now.
0:57:54 - 0:57:57::And people need to hear some positivity and some amazingness.
0:57:57 - 0:57:59::And we're bringing that into the world.
0:57:59 - 0:58:00::We kind of...
0:58:00 - 0:58:03::And I kind of believe that I'm feeling amazing.
0:58:03 - 0:58:07::Because we did that on the one recorded this afternoon.
0:58:07 - 0:58:08::You were...
0:58:08 - 0:58:09::You were going...
0:58:09 - 0:58:12::And I legit got a little bit emotional to be like...
0:58:12 - 0:58:15::Because they're so relieved to have someone not yelling at that person.
0:58:15 - 0:58:16::Yeah, yeah.
0:58:16 - 0:58:17::Because they pick up the phone.
0:58:17 - 0:58:18::And if you've ever worked at a restaurant...
0:58:18 - 0:58:19::Oh, yeah.
0:58:19 - 0:58:21::When that phone rings, first of all, someone's growing up...
0:58:21 - 0:58:22::And you need to pick it up and...
0:58:22 - 0:58:24::And we have all worked in a restaurant, right?
0:58:24 - 0:58:25::Oh, yeah.
0:58:25 - 0:58:26::And so...
0:58:26 - 0:58:29::And so when you pick up that phone, you know it's going to be so...
0:58:29 - 0:58:31::Oh, you didn't validate my parking.
0:58:31 - 0:58:32::You rat!
0:58:32 - 0:58:33::You didn't...
0:58:33 - 0:58:35::I should come back in there and break the glass like a man.
0:58:35 - 0:58:37::I have been fired by a customer.
0:58:37 - 0:58:41::A customer has came in and fired me.
0:58:41 - 0:58:42::I swear to God.
0:58:42 - 0:58:43::I'm from Russia.
0:58:43 - 0:58:44::What does that mean?
0:58:44 - 0:58:46::I have been fired by a customer.
0:58:46 - 0:58:48::Like, I know that customer's...
0:58:48 - 0:58:52::And people when they call into the business...
0:58:52 - 0:58:54::You are to be scared and afraid.
0:58:54 - 0:58:56::Because they're not going to say something good.
0:58:56 - 0:58:58::What's the tough things I've ever heard?
0:58:58 - 0:58:59::I'm so sorry.
0:58:59 - 0:59:00::It's all good.
0:59:00 - 0:59:01::It's all good.
0:59:01 - 0:59:02::It's in the past now.

0:59:22 - 0:59:23::I don't have it.
0:59:23 - 0:59:26::But a couple of those bites were so good.
0:59:26 - 0:59:28::And I think this tuna is so wet.
0:59:28 - 0:59:31::How does the croissant stay so dry?
0:59:31 - 0:59:32::I don't know.
0:59:32 - 0:59:36::I'm sure it's some type of chemical that's not good for me in the long run.
0:59:37 - 0:59:39::But that brought me joy.
0:59:39 - 0:59:40::So I'll just leave it there.
0:59:40 - 0:59:41::And it's wild what man.

1:00:39.040000 - 1:00:45.080000::Everyone was there to dance and listen and sing to this music. It's not background music. It's not ambiance
1:00:45.080000 - 1:00:49.720000::Right, it was really enjoying a genre of music that has been
1:00:49.720000 - 1:00:53.840000::And it wasn't a me of last it wasn't about the food. It wasn't about the alcohol
1:00:53.840000 - 1:00:59.080000::It wasn't about the dancing it was a little strictly about listening to the music
