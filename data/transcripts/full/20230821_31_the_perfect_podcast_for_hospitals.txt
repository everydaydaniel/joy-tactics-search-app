0:00:44 - 0:00:45::What is happening?
0:00:45 - 0:00:46::What the hell was that?
0:00:46 - 0:00:47::Jack?
0:00:47 - 0:00:50::That's AI.
0:00:50 - 0:00:52::You just say, I'm my fucking voice dude.
0:00:52 - 0:00:53::Are you fucking serious, man?
0:00:53 - 0:00:54::I don't know.
0:00:54 - 0:00:55::I didn't do that shit.
0:00:55 - 0:00:56::Eric, why not?
0:00:56 - 0:00:57::Eric, get my back, man.
0:00:57 - 0:00:58::Get my back.
0:00:58 - 0:00:59::Oh, my.
0:00:59 - 0:01:00::It was a huge a man.
0:01:00 - 0:01:04::Why does my voice like sound kind of busted right now?
0:01:04 - 0:01:08::What the hell?
0:01:08 - 0:01:10::Oh, my God.
0:01:10 - 0:01:11::Did you write that?
0:01:11 - 0:01:16::Or that was synthesized from how we speak over many podcasts.
0:01:16 - 0:01:18::I wrote that.
0:01:19 - 0:01:20::See, they could know they can't.
0:01:20 - 0:01:22::It's not at that level yet.
0:01:22 - 0:01:30::That is what this is so twisted because I thought I had to be afraid of these big corporations stealing my voice, stealing my likeness.
0:01:30 - 0:01:39::And who do I have is the person closest to me that is taking my voice, taking our voices and using it for purposes that I don't know what you could be doing here.
0:01:39 - 0:01:40::That's right.
0:01:40 - 0:01:47::We're already dealing with the Eric's image enemies spread across the internet on many different pages, on many.
0:01:48 - 0:01:49::Oh, yeah.
0:01:49 - 0:01:51::Let me give a status update on that.
0:01:51 - 0:01:54::The worst is come to pass.
0:01:54 - 0:02:01::And even the moderators found that to be fake on Reddit and did the right moral thing to do and they removed it.
0:02:01 - 0:02:07::This is spread like a fast growing weed across all the other social media platforms.
0:02:07 - 0:02:13::And it's currently on a Facebook meme page called That's Controversial.
0:02:13 - 0:02:16::And it's got about 325,000 likes.
0:02:16 - 0:02:19::And it's fake news, man.
0:02:19 - 0:02:22::It can never, it can't be stopped.
0:02:22 - 0:02:23::It can't be stopped.
0:02:23 - 0:02:25::It's making my ass laugh, frankly.
0:02:25 - 0:02:27::But the people on Facebook are all nice about it.
0:02:27 - 0:02:29::On Reddit, they're like, you liars.
0:02:29 - 0:02:32::You're destroying the sanctity of this on Facebook.
0:02:32 - 0:02:36::Like every single comment is like, dude, that is not a bad neighbor.
0:02:36 - 0:02:37::That's an amazing neighbor.
0:02:38 - 0:02:43::And like I would have brought him some fucking whiskey and a fucking, you know what I mean?
0:02:43 - 0:02:46::They're trying to be kind of Americana about it.
0:02:46 - 0:02:51::I guess that's nice that all the boomers and older people, that's the society that they envision.
0:02:51 - 0:02:52::Well, Facebook is fun.
0:02:52 - 0:02:54::Facebook is fun.
0:02:54 - 0:02:55::Yeah.
0:02:55 - 0:02:56::Reddit is serious, Twitter is serious.
0:02:56 - 0:02:59::Everyone on Instagram is fake.
0:02:59 - 0:03:02::Facebook is where you have fun and where you can kick back and you relax.
0:03:02 - 0:03:04::And you don't worry about anything else.
0:03:05 - 0:03:07::There's nothing going on except.
0:03:07 - 0:03:12::Should we start a bumping Joy Tactics Facebook page?
0:03:12 - 0:03:14::Hell yeah, we should do it.
0:03:14 - 0:03:15::We have to be not having it.
0:03:15 - 0:03:18::And just be posting like all day long on there.
0:03:18 - 0:03:22::Like just, is there like Facebook podcast network, you know what I'm saying?
0:03:22 - 0:03:23::What am I trying to say?
0:03:23 - 0:03:25::Like Facebook live or something?
0:03:25 - 0:03:27::There must be.
0:03:27 - 0:03:29::Yeah, definitely because that's where everybody gets their start.
0:03:29 - 0:03:32::Isn't that where that where like a lot of Trump people got together?
0:03:32 - 0:03:35::Not that we're like that, but isn't that where like so far from that?
0:03:35 - 0:03:38::Well, we need to start running Facebook ads.
0:03:38 - 0:03:39::Are you guys down for that?
0:03:39 - 0:03:43::We can spend like, or we 80% of our Patreon money.
0:03:43 - 0:03:48::And we could target specific people and we could, who do we want to target?
0:03:48 - 0:03:49::You know what I'm saying?
0:03:49 - 0:03:53::Should we target people that we think could like our podcast or should we target enemies?
0:03:53 - 0:03:54::You know what I'm saying?
0:03:54 - 0:03:57::Well, that's a bit what we want to discuss today.
0:03:57 - 0:03:58::Yeah.
0:03:59 - 0:04:00::Target.
0:04:00 - 0:04:01::Target.
0:04:01 - 0:04:05::Target the ads towards sick people.
0:04:05 - 0:04:06::Right.
0:04:06 - 0:04:07::Right.
0:04:07 - 0:04:08::Because guess what?
0:04:08 - 0:04:14::They have at that point when you're that sick, if you're really badly sick, money becomes monopoly money.
0:04:14 - 0:04:15::You know what I mean?
0:04:15 - 0:04:16::Because whatever you got saved up.
0:04:16 - 0:04:17::Oh, that's true.
0:04:17 - 0:04:18::That's it.
0:04:18 - 0:04:19::This is genius.
0:04:19 - 0:04:20::Go fucking spend it.
0:04:20 - 0:04:21::Hey, man.
0:04:21 - 0:04:27::Yeah, especially those the hypochondriac types, by the way, because everybody every day is googling like,
0:04:27 - 0:04:28::I'm gonna get a headache.
0:04:28 - 0:04:29::Gonna kill me.
0:04:29 - 0:04:30::Is this infection in my toe?
0:04:30 - 0:04:31::Gonna do the fucking Bob Marley shit to me or whatever.
0:04:31 - 0:04:32::However, I got it.
0:04:32 - 0:04:36::I got to say the cat Williams joke from the Pimp Chronicles that I just heard.
0:04:36 - 0:04:38::Where he's talking about.
0:04:38 - 0:04:39::What is that?
0:04:39 - 0:04:44::You know, you guys must know this one where he's talking about how weed is a plant and it can't,
0:04:44 - 0:04:48::if you should so happen instead of on fire, you might feel some effects.
0:04:48 - 0:04:54::But if you take, you know, 13 aspirin, that's going to be your last headache.
0:04:55 - 0:04:57::Yeah, pretty good cat Williams.
0:04:57 - 0:04:59::Cat Williams, the goat, the chicken wing goat.
0:04:59 - 0:05:00::Catwood.

0:05:00 - 0:05:02.140000::Williams does not get enough respect.
0:05:02.140000 - 0:05:03.680000::And he does not play.
0:05:03.680000 - 0:05:04.880000::He does not play.
0:05:04.880000 - 0:05:05.720000::He plays theaters.
0:05:05.720000 - 0:05:06.560000::Oh, okay.
0:05:06.560000 - 0:05:09.440000::So what's the topic of today's episode, guys?
0:05:09.440000 - 0:05:10.440000::Hospitals.
0:05:10.440000 - 0:05:11.280000::Hospitals.
0:05:11.280000 - 0:05:12.360000::Get into it.
0:05:12.360000 - 0:05:14.960000::This is going to be due to people that are laid up
0:05:14.960000 - 0:05:18.160000::in the fucking hospital with either broken bones
0:05:18.160000 - 0:05:20.800000::or broken organs, whatever it is.
0:05:20.800000 - 0:05:24.200000::We, this episode is for you guys.
0:05:24.200000 - 0:05:27.800000::And the idea here is that you guys will listen.
0:05:27.800000 - 0:05:30.960000::You guys will be there in the hospital doing your thing.
0:05:30.960000 - 0:05:32.800000::And you'll be sitting in bed going like this.
0:05:32.800000 - 0:05:37.200000::And everyone's going to go, what the hell?
0:05:37.200000 - 0:05:40.040000::This person just got ran over by a fucking 25 wheeler.
0:05:40.040000 - 0:05:41.240000::How are they so happy right now?
0:05:41.240000 - 0:05:42.320000::What's getting them through this?
0:05:42.320000 - 0:05:43.240000::What's powering them on?
0:05:43.240000 - 0:05:44.800000::Like fucking energizer, buddy.
0:05:44.800000 - 0:05:47.400000::Then you take your fucking headphones off to go,
0:05:47.400000 - 0:05:50.520000::I was just, sorry, I can't even,
0:05:52.160000 - 0:05:55.360000::it's the, get to it, man, get to it.
0:05:55.360000 - 0:05:56.920000::Show them the computer screen.
0:05:56.920000 - 0:05:57.920000::Joy tactics.
0:05:57.920000 - 0:05:58.920000::Joy tactics.
0:05:58.920000 - 0:05:59.920000::Podcasts.
0:05:59.920000 - 0:06:02.560000::And then get beg them to bring in whoever is the manager,
0:06:02.560000 - 0:06:04.440000::the regional manager of the hospital
0:06:04.440000 - 0:06:07.520000::and explain to them, look, I know these guys,
0:06:07.520000 - 0:06:09.600000::I can cut you all a deal for your programming
0:06:09.600000 - 0:06:12.920000::on the television programs throughout the hospital.
0:06:12.920000 - 0:06:15::I think this is a business if you guys are willing to go in.
0:06:15 - 0:06:16.920000::We can give you workout a percentage.
0:06:19.120000 - 0:06:20.440000::That's what we're trying to do with this.
0:06:20.440000 - 0:06:22.160000::It's explore different marketplaces.
0:06:22.160000 - 0:06:26.640000::And I want this shit to spread, ward to ward, like wildfire.
0:06:26.640000 - 0:06:28.640000::Well, this is the smart deal.
0:06:28.640000 - 0:06:32.360000::What's the noise policy in hospitals?
0:06:32.360000 - 0:06:36.320000::Because can you bring in a Bluetooth beats pill
0:06:36.320000 - 0:06:40.320000::and crank it up all the way and hit the joy tactics
0:06:40.320000 - 0:06:42.200000::and get the whole hospital bump in, you know?
0:06:42.200000 - 0:06:43.360000::Oh, everybody's using it.
0:06:43.360000 - 0:06:44.840000::Oh, I see where you're saying it.
0:06:44.840000 - 0:06:47.560000::Could you do it like a, you know, there's like spy band aids
0:06:47.560000 - 0:06:49.160000::where the spies come around with a band aid
0:06:49.160000 - 0:06:52.280000::and they put it on a car and then it's actually a bomb.
0:06:52.280000 - 0:06:54.080000::Could we do that with Bluetooth band aids
0:06:54.080000 - 0:06:56.160000::and go around and start smacking sound band aids
0:06:56.200000 - 0:06:57.200000::all over the world?
0:06:57.200000 - 0:06:58.040000::Whoa.
0:06:58.040000 - 0:07:00.880000::It's like, and then everybody,
0:07:00.880000 - 0:07:02.480000::my god, that's something like that.
0:07:02.480000 - 0:07:04.800000::Well, you know, as we get smarter
0:07:04.800000 - 0:07:07.320000::and as as processing power becomes extremely cheap,
0:07:07.320000 - 0:07:10.680000::we're gonna have crazy gadgets like that very soon.
0:07:10.680000 - 0:07:11.520000::Let's go.
0:07:11.520000 - 0:07:14.320000::I think sound band aids are the first ones that we,
0:07:14.320000 - 0:07:15.160000::oh, I had a question.
0:07:15.160000 - 0:07:17.880000::Do you guys think that anybody who's ever,
0:07:17.880000 - 0:07:20.960000::do you think anybody has listened to joy tactics
0:07:20.960000 - 0:07:24.400000::before, heard our voices in the years and the last six months
0:07:24.400000 - 0:07:25.840000::and then has passed away?
0:07:25.840000 - 0:07:26.920000::Yes.
0:07:26.920000 - 0:07:27.760000::Yes.
0:07:27.760000 - 0:07:28.760000::Oh, god.
0:07:28.760000 - 0:07:32.200000::And I would say that there's actually many.
0:07:32.200000 - 0:07:33.040000::No.
0:07:33.040000 - 0:07:34.040000::Hold on, it wasn't,
0:07:34.040000 - 0:07:36.520000::many, we don't gather that man.
0:07:36.520000 - 0:07:39.480000::Well, there's a couple of reasons for that.
0:07:39.480000 - 0:07:41.360000::One of the reasons, one of the reasons it's not
0:07:41.360000 - 0:07:43.320000::is that they heard it and they liked it so little
0:07:43.320000 - 0:07:45.320000::that they decided to end it all.
0:07:45.320000 - 0:07:47.680000::One of the reasons it may be, I could see,
0:07:47.680000 - 0:07:52.680000::is that they kind of saw like that there could be more,
0:07:52.840000 - 0:07:54.520000::there could be something behind the curtain
0:07:54.560000 - 0:07:56.960000::that is the spirit and they,
0:07:58.680000 - 0:08:01::I don't wanna take credit for any of this.
0:08:01 - 0:08:02.360000::I'm back pedaling.
0:08:02.360000 - 0:08:05.840000::My opinion is that especially a lot of men see,
0:08:05.840000 - 0:08:08.600000::men get jealous of other men's relationships.
0:08:08.600000 - 0:08:09.880000::Let's just be honest about that.
0:08:09.880000 - 0:08:10.720000::Right.
0:08:10.720000 - 0:08:12.120000::They may be just a friendship way.
0:08:12.120000 - 0:08:14.240000::And I think if you are a lonely male
0:08:14.240000 - 0:08:16.800000::that has never got a chance to live in one of the big cities,
0:08:16.800000 - 0:08:21.080000::which all of us have spent plenty of time in those suckers,
0:08:21.080000 - 0:08:22.560000::they probably look at our chemistry
0:08:22.560000 - 0:08:25.040000::and our effortless kind of banter.
0:08:25.040000 - 0:08:27.760000::And they're like, well, I'll never fucking have that.
0:08:27.760000 - 0:08:30.960000::There's no chance that I, and if you're one of those men
0:08:30.960000 - 0:08:33.160000::and you feel that and you feel lonely,
0:08:33.160000 - 0:08:35.040000::there's a couple of guys out there for you.
0:08:35.040000 - 0:08:35.880000::I'll just say that.
0:08:35.880000 - 0:08:37.240000::Ben and Jerry.
0:08:37.240000 - 0:08:38.080000::Okay.
0:08:38.080000 - 0:08:39.240000::What?
0:08:39.240000 - 0:08:40.440000::Ben and Jerry.
0:08:40.440000 - 0:08:41.680000::Ben and Jerry.
0:08:41.680000 - 0:08:42.680000::Digital fist bump.
0:08:42.680000 - 0:08:44.800000::Yeah, that was amazing.
0:08:44.800000 - 0:08:46.360000::Yeah, there's a couple of guys out there for you.
0:08:46.360000 - 0:08:49.440000::Jack and Daniel, Jim and Bean.
0:08:49.440000 - 0:08:51.400000::Ben and Jerry.
0:08:51.400000 - 0:08:52.880000::Rob and a chair.
0:08:52.880000 - 0:08:53.880000::Fucking idiots.
0:08:53.880000 - 0:08:55.200000::I give fucking shit.
0:08:55.200000 - 0:08:56.120000::Fuck these people, man.
0:08:56.120000 - 0:08:57.120000::I'm sick of it.
0:08:57.120000 - 0:08:59.120000::All these friends are a hell of a jealous.
0:08:59.120000 - 0:09:01.880000::Remember, I feel like when the three of us sit at like a table
0:09:01.880000 - 0:09:05::at a bar or something and they literally are like,
0:09:05 - 0:09:08.160000::yeah, like losing it, dying life and you look over in the corner
0:09:08.160000 - 0:09:11::and there's like eight like frat finance bros,
0:09:11 - 0:09:14.120000::all just like trying to find a topic that they can relate
0:09:14.120000 - 0:09:15.600000::to each other on.
0:09:15.600000 - 0:09:17.760000::That's pathetic.
0:09:17.760000 - 0:09:18.760000::Yeah.
0:09:18.760000 - 0:09:21.960000::Well, let's get into what the fine, what sickness is,
0:09:21.960000 - 0:09:24.720000::what the fine, what injury is.
0:09:24.720000 - 0:09:27.120000::I want to relate first off to everybody in the hospital
0:09:27.120000 - 0:09:27.960000::right now.
0:09:27.960000 - 0:09:29.480000::I kind of feel sorry for you.
0:09:29.480000 - 0:09:30.480000::Okay.
0:09:30.480000 - 0:09:34.560000::I just this weekend, I wasn't going to make this about myself,
0:09:34.560000 - 0:09:38.160000::but my hand has been forced because this weekend,
0:09:38.160000 - 0:09:40.800000::I spent it in Wisconsin.
0:09:40.800000 - 0:09:41.640000::Okay.
0:09:41.640000 - 0:09:44.440000::I'm in Chicago right now, but drove up to Wisconsin
0:09:44.440000 - 0:09:47.520000::to a lake called Elkhart Lake with some friends.
0:09:47.520000 - 0:09:49.400000::And this was a much anticipated trip
0:09:49.400000 - 0:09:52.880000::where I was anticipating everything to go right,
0:09:52.880000 - 0:09:54.520000::but it didn't.
0:09:54.520000 - 0:09:59.520000::And I've been plagued by injury, okay, and sickness.
0:09:59.520000 - 0:10:00.520000::And I'll just,

0:10:00 - 0:10:03.280000::kind of run through all the things that have happened to me. I don't know what I did
0:10:03.280000 - 0:10:10.400000::to deserve this. But the first night I got here, my sleep apnea of mask fell off, okay?
0:10:10.400000 - 0:10:15.360000::Which usually isn't a big issue, but if I'm positioned the right way on my back, I have
0:10:15.360000 - 0:10:21.200000::what is called a breathing attack. It's where you start breathing out.
0:10:21.200000 - 0:10:26.720000::You never seen me do this, Nate. Jack has been privy to it. I've been evicted to it.
0:10:27.520000 - 0:10:34::I was shared meds with both the attacks. You stop breathing for a while because of the
0:10:34 - 0:10:39.680000::sleep apnea is closing your throat shut. And then your body is getting no oxygen, so it wakes you up.
0:10:40.560000 - 0:10:46.800000::And it sounds like, just trying to get air into your lungs, you know what I mean?
0:10:48.320000 - 0:10:51.920000::And the masks are good. Friend was sleeping out in the living room. He'd never heard it like this
0:10:51.920000 - 0:10:56.960000::before. And basically what happens is you're up and standing by the time that you're awake.
0:10:56.960000 - 0:11:01.600000::You know, your body's already gotten yourself up. So I'm like grasping at the fucking
0:11:02.560000 - 0:11:06.720000::door handle. Like it feels like you're dying. And you're cawing.
0:11:08.560000 - 0:11:13.200000::And then, okay, I've had that happen before, but I must have in my flailing, in my sleep,
0:11:14.960000 - 0:11:19.680000::rolled over my thumb or my thumb got caught. And I looked down at my thumb and my thumbnail is all
0:11:19.680000 - 0:11:27.120000::flipped backwards and bleeding. So it's like it's really see it now, but it's, it doesn't look so bad,
0:11:27.120000 - 0:11:31.440000::but like, no, that looks awful. If you're not looking at, if you just listening right now,
0:11:31.440000 - 0:11:37.760000::Eric's thumb looks like basically somebody fucking dunk a free-to-lay into a can of salsa,
0:11:37.760000 - 0:11:42.720000::and then fucking stepped on it. It looks, it's hard to even look at that man. Okay, it doesn't look
0:11:42.720000 - 0:11:48.080000::so bad, but it fucking did her and the blood is coming out. Okay, that's not night one, okay?
0:11:48.720000 - 0:11:54.560000::Then what happens? I would get to the lake, amazing can't wait. One down side, the lake's more shallow
0:11:54.560000 - 0:12:00::than we knew. And then the Airbnb host is saying, hey, be careful, there's zebra mussels lining the
0:12:00 - 0:12:04.960000::bottom of the lake. And by the way, these are invasive, this is an invasive species from China.
0:12:04.960000 - 0:12:08.720000::I don't know how they got here. I maybe don't want to go too far down that rabbit hole.
0:12:08.720000 - 0:12:11.440000::Let's just say Anthony Fauci is getting into his, um,
0:12:12.240000 - 0:12:14.320000::clientele. Yeah, whatever you just talked about mussels.
0:12:15.920000 - 0:12:19.280000::But I'm being careful. I'm walking along. And then finally, I think it's deep enough. So I
0:12:19.280000 - 0:12:24.880000::start swimming and I'm doing the breaststroke kick and I kick too hard and I end up slicing my toe
0:12:25.600000 - 0:12:30.160000::on one of the fucking zebra mussels. And I don't even know, it hurts, but I'm like, oh, I'll pull it
0:12:30.160000 - 0:12:35.200000::up. There's no nothing. Can't even see a cut. Mussels just banged it. Then I get on the dock.
0:12:35.200000 - 0:12:41.200000::And what do I notice? But blood all over the dock. Whose blood is that? Well, it was mine. No.
0:12:41.280000 - 0:12:46.720000::Okay. Then I'm stuck with being a hypokondriac. And I'm thinking, I was walking along that
0:12:46.720000 - 0:12:51.680000::mucky lake with the open, well, this is how people get that flesh eating bacteria as it goes right
0:12:51.680000 - 0:12:58.800000::in the bloodstream from the lake. Okay. So blah blah all that. Then I guess what? The next night,
0:12:59.520000 - 0:13:09.280000::I wake up achy mussels. Okay. No congestion. Nothing else, but slightly sick. So yeah, to everybody who
0:13:09.280000 - 0:13:15.760000::says I haven't fucking easy. Listen to that laundry list. Everyone goes your life is fucked up,
0:13:15.760000 - 0:13:23.040000::man. Dude, that was like, you're you're ever just like in a moment and I'm just you just know it's
0:13:23.040000 - 0:13:28.320000::part of history. Yeah, like I feel like while that was happening, I was seeing the YouTube clip
0:13:28.320000 - 0:13:37.920000::already being made that was like Eric Rahill tells like the craziest like weekend type of story
0:13:38 - 0:13:41.920000::on the planet and just the views. I was just looking at the views like, but
0:13:43.280000 - 0:13:49.760000::like go to the fucking moon, not even on some comedy shit on some like podcasts like, damn,
0:13:50.880000 - 0:13:55.440000::people's lives can be so crazy. You tell me a zebra clam was in a way. You're listening in like
0:13:55.440000 - 0:14:00.800000::4d jack, like you're thinking of the clip that will also like chime in and like fucking right.
0:14:00.800000 - 0:14:06.800000::Well, you have that Savon style podcast brain. Well, I have to be all that's so it's not the other
0:14:06.800000 - 0:14:11.440000::part of Savon. You know, so Eric, can we just sum up just some of the fucked up things that have
0:14:11.440000 - 0:14:15.520000::been happening to you this year. Yeah, because you had a hell of it. And it's not cute anymore.
0:14:15.520000 - 0:14:20.480000::By the way, Eric, it's not cute. People thought it was fun at first. Oh, he's fucking lost. Yeah,
0:14:20.480000 - 0:14:25.440000::it's funny to make all these things. Oh, this is hilarious. It's not funny anymore. Your life is
0:14:25.440000 - 0:14:31.360000::hell and you are you and you're never gonna recover from this from these last couple months. And
0:14:31.360000 - 0:14:35.760000::it's going to do your reversible damage to your life, to your friendships, to your relationships.
0:14:35.760000 - 0:14:40.480000::Yep. And it's just not fun. It's not funny. More it's serious right now. Okay.
0:14:40.480000 - 0:14:45.920000::It is. God is testing you. So let's just sum up all the fucked up shit that's having you in the last
0:14:45.920000 - 0:14:49.280000::six years. Okay. Yeah. Just to give because there's a lot of new listeners coming in. Right.
0:14:49.280000 - 0:14:52.560000::All right. And they and they don't know how bad your life has been.
0:14:53.280000 - 0:14:57.360000::All right. And I would say good luck trying to remember everything because it's a laundry list.
0:14:57.360000 - 0:14:59.680000::It is. It is. I mean, I would say

0:15:00 - 0:15:02.720000::go ahead and try and I'll correct you.
0:15:02.720000 - 0:15:05.960000::Okay, so you want us to, from our memory of you.
0:15:05.960000 - 0:15:07.960000::All right, here I could start it back pretty far back.
0:15:07.960000 - 0:15:09.760000::All right, why don't we start it from
0:15:09.760000 - 0:15:13.200000::when Eric found a bunch of rat bones in his car.
0:15:13.200000 - 0:15:14.200000::Oh.
0:15:14.200000 - 0:15:18.080000::Now that's probably 2020.
0:15:18.080000 - 0:15:18.920000::That might be 2020.
0:15:18.920000 - 0:15:20.560000::Hey, every talk about this on the podcast.
0:15:20.560000 - 0:15:21.880000::I don't know how to do to me.
0:15:21.880000 - 0:15:23.320000::You have God damn it.
0:15:23.320000 - 0:15:26.040000::Okay, so this was fucking what the hell?
0:15:26.040000 - 0:15:28.080000::Well, we're out in Pennsylvania.
0:15:28.640000 - 0:15:30.560000::Us three were driving in the car, right?
0:15:30.560000 - 0:15:32.880000::And I get out of the car we show up to the house.
0:15:32.880000 - 0:15:37.200000::I get out and I see some looks like a stick is stuck
0:15:37.200000 - 0:15:39.280000::in the front of my underneath my headlight,
0:15:39.280000 - 0:15:42.200000::like down towards the bottom of the car.
0:15:42.200000 - 0:15:44.320000::So there's like a little white stick sticking out.
0:15:44.320000 - 0:15:45.280000::I pull it out.
0:15:45.280000 - 0:15:46.120000::What the hell?
0:15:46.120000 - 0:15:47.760000::There's a bunch more fucking of these sticks.
0:15:47.760000 - 0:15:50.480000::Well, it's fucking bones.
0:15:50.480000 - 0:15:54.400000::It's fucking some animal, small animal bone coming up in there.
0:15:54.400000 - 0:15:57.920000::And, you know, try to pull them out all good
0:15:57.960000 - 0:15:59.920000::and then the more I drive these sticks,
0:15:59.920000 - 0:16:01.640000::all these bones keep coming out.
0:16:01.640000 - 0:16:05.920000::And as it turns out, rats had taken up residents
0:16:05.920000 - 0:16:08.400000::in the bottom of my car and were eating up chicken bones
0:16:08.400000 - 0:16:12.760000::and bird bones and putting all their bone graveyard
0:16:12.760000 - 0:16:14.080000::down in my car.
0:16:14.080000 - 0:16:18.280000::Yeah, I think a similar thing has happened in my vehicle.
0:16:18.280000 - 0:16:21.240000::Did you take it to an auto mechanic?
0:16:21.240000 - 0:16:22.400000::Yeah, I did.
0:16:22.400000 - 0:16:23.240000::I did.
0:16:23.240000 - 0:16:24.840000::Did they say anything about this like wire
0:16:24.840000 - 0:16:26.600000::that's like edible to the soul?
0:16:26.600000 - 0:16:29.120000::It's wrapped in like soy.
0:16:29.120000 - 0:16:32.880000::There's this fucking seaweed, the seaweed in the car.
0:16:32.880000 - 0:16:35.120000::There's basically like rap food is like,
0:16:35.120000 - 0:16:37.520000::they try to make it more environmentally conscious,
0:16:37.520000 - 0:16:41::some wire on your fucking car and rats eat it.
0:16:41 - 0:16:43.320000::And they, it's yummy to them.
0:16:43.320000 - 0:16:44.720000::I love it.
0:16:44.720000 - 0:16:45.560000::I love it.
0:16:45.560000 - 0:16:46.400000::Thanks, man.
0:16:46.400000 - 0:16:47.240000::It's smart.
0:16:47.240000 - 0:16:48.080000::Yeah, very smart.
0:16:48.080000 - 0:16:49.560000::Yeah, that's environmentally safe.
0:16:49.560000 - 0:16:52.200000::Why don't we make the entire military industrial complex
0:16:52.200000 - 0:16:53.240000::out of fucking cotton candy?
0:16:53.240000 - 0:16:56.040000::Then what al-Qaeda's gonna come and eat our fucking tanks?
0:16:56.040000 - 0:16:57.040000::Cool, man.
0:16:57.040000 - 0:16:58.640000::I'm sick of these living years.
0:16:58.640000 - 0:17:00.560000::I'll go to the same year's debate one of the generals, Jack.
0:17:00.560000 - 0:17:04.840000::I will debate them with my fists and my words at the same time.
0:17:04.840000 - 0:17:05.840000::That's interesting.
0:17:05.840000 - 0:17:07.120000::We think it's you in something tank.
0:17:07.120000 - 0:17:09.800000::Has there been a fight and a debate,
0:17:09.800000 - 0:17:12::simultaneous style, you know what I'm saying?
0:17:12 - 0:17:14.840000::Like, you have to argue while beating the shit out
0:17:14.840000 - 0:17:15.680000::of each other.
0:17:15.680000 - 0:17:16.520000::Doodles.
0:17:16.520000 - 0:17:17.360000::Doodles.
0:17:17.360000 - 0:17:18.360000::And you get rid of it.
0:17:18.360000 - 0:17:19.360000::Or some of your little ones.
0:17:19.360000 - 0:17:20.560000::We had presidents do in the 1800s.
0:17:20.560000 - 0:17:21.400000::You know what I mean?
0:17:21.400000 - 0:17:22.400000::Aaron Burr.
0:17:22.400000 - 0:17:23.680000::When men were men.
0:17:23.680000 - 0:17:26::Oh yeah, now they're coming in the face with a glove.
0:17:26 - 0:17:27.640000::What the hell is that?
0:17:27.640000 - 0:17:28.640000::What do you say?
0:17:28.640000 - 0:17:30.120000::I'm like, you're fucking moving.
0:17:30.120000 - 0:17:32.560000::I would be challenging so many people to doodles.
0:17:32.560000 - 0:17:35.440000::Like, it would be, I wouldn't have lived till out.
0:17:35.440000 - 0:17:39::I would have been dead by 17 if I lived in 1800s.
0:17:39 - 0:17:42.200000::It would have just been, because my aim is off.
0:17:42.200000 - 0:17:43.480000::I don't have good eyesight either.
0:17:43.480000 - 0:17:45.840000::So I would have just...
0:17:45.840000 - 0:17:48.040000::Remember when Homer Simpson gets the glove
0:17:48.040000 - 0:17:50.800000::and he's slapping everybody in Springfield to give it away
0:17:50.800000 - 0:17:51.640000::to us?
0:17:51.640000 - 0:17:52.480000::Yes, I do remember that.
0:17:52.480000 - 0:17:54.080000::And finally he runs into an old time.
0:17:54.080000 - 0:17:57.760000::And he likes dualists.
0:17:57.760000 - 0:17:59.080000::Who challenges him?
0:17:59.080000 - 0:18:00.080000::Shout out to the Simpsons.
0:18:00.080000 - 0:18:01.080000::I kind of like that.
0:18:01.080000 - 0:18:02.080000::I like the sound of that.
0:18:02.080000 - 0:18:03.080000::Yeah, Simpsons.
0:18:03.080000 - 0:18:06.080000::Oh yeah, seems today.
0:18:06.080000 - 0:18:08.280000::Okay, so you see, yeah.
0:18:08.280000 - 0:18:09.800000::The rap bones.
0:18:09.800000 - 0:18:11.600000::That's family guy, dude.
0:18:11.600000 - 0:18:14.840000::I don't want to say it, but that's right.
0:18:14.840000 - 0:18:16.520000::Rap bones and that was nothing.
0:18:16.520000 - 0:18:18::That was just almost nothing.
0:18:18 - 0:18:19.480000::Okay.
0:18:19.480000 - 0:18:21.320000::Okay.
0:18:21.320000 - 0:18:23.120000::Compared to what would come in the future.
0:18:23.120000 - 0:18:25.880000::Compared to what in the payroll that was coming down the pipeline.
0:18:25.880000 - 0:18:27.360000::Let's see what else.
0:18:27.360000 - 0:18:29.200000::My parents got divorced in 2017.
0:18:29.200000 - 0:18:31.600000::That was a fucking blow.
0:18:31.600000 - 0:18:34.240000::You still haven't recovered from that.
0:18:34.240000 - 0:18:35.240000::You still haven't.
0:18:35.240000 - 0:18:36.240000::And you bring it up a lot.
0:18:36.240000 - 0:18:40.240000::And I mean, we're putting you through therapy and we're...
0:18:40.240000 - 0:18:43.560000::I don't know if you'll ever come back from this.
0:18:43.560000 - 0:18:46.560000::Well, I got hella money go funded to me to do therapy
0:18:46.560000 - 0:18:51.160000::because my parents divorced that happened when I was 25.
0:18:51.160000 - 0:18:53.080000::And all that money is going to therapy, right?
0:18:53.120000 - 0:18:54.360000::Because there was a lot of money.
0:18:54.360000 - 0:18:57.400000::I was like, I spent the first $6,000 on Fernet.
0:19:02.200000 - 0:19:03.200000::Yo.
0:19:03.200000 - 0:19:05::Oh, there's some of this.
0:19:05 - 0:19:06.400000::Look at this background there, Jack.
0:19:06.400000 - 0:19:07.600000::Sir, Sherman.
0:19:07.600000 - 0:19:12.680000::Everybody knows that joy tactics is mostly about meeting celebrities, of course.
0:19:12.680000 - 0:19:17.080000::And what you'll notice behind me, and this is just the ton of lifestyles that we live,
0:19:17.080000 - 0:19:19.800000::as you'll notice, are those two people just thirsty?
0:19:19.800000 - 0:19:20.800000::What are they doing here?
0:19:20.800000 - 0:19:22.440000::What are they doing there?
0:19:22.880000 - 0:19:26.600000::Those are two people working in entertainment.
0:19:26.600000 - 0:19:27.600000::That's awesome.
0:19:27.600000 - 0:19:28.600000::Don't even put them on the mic.
0:19:28.600000 - 0:19:29.600000::Just keep them in the background.
0:19:29.600000 - 0:19:31.760000::That's how hard this podcast is.
0:19:31.760000 - 0:19:33::Like it doesn't even...
0:19:33 - 0:19:35::Hello, it's me, Sarah's a Liberty Sherman.
0:19:35 - 0:19:36.200000::And it's a Liberty guest.
0:19:36.200000 - 0:19:38.800000::Popped in, bam right there.
0:19:38.800000 - 0:19:40.280000::Just doing cocaine.
0:19:40.280000 - 0:19:44.240000::So, and it looks like you guys are in the vice offices right now.
0:19:44.240000 - 0:19:46.040000::They are just got bought out, right?
0:19:46.040000 - 0:19:47::Was that the...
0:19:47 - 0:19:50.840000::Yeah, we bought Sarah bought vice and we're about two blocks away from vice's headquarters
0:19:50.840000 - 0:19:51.840000::right now.
0:19:51.840000 - 0:19:55.680000::Cooking up some new ideas for documentaries of crazy...
0:19:55.680000 - 0:19:58.400000::I got adult braces, something like that.

0:20:00 - 0:20:03.500000::Well, we are tripping so right now.
0:20:03.500000 - 0:20:05.900000::Can we talk about hospitals real quick?
0:20:05.900000 - 0:20:07.140000::No, yeah, we'll wait.
0:20:07.140000 - 0:20:09.340000::So sorry, we're back to Eric's fucked up life.
0:20:09.340000 - 0:20:12.740000::We really don't have to, I mean, literally it'll be so depressing.
0:20:12.740000 - 0:20:15.440000::So Eric basically to sum up Eric has lost his job.
0:20:15.440000 - 0:20:19.540000::He is more depressing than he's ever been in his entire life.
0:20:19.540000 - 0:20:20.540000::He has fucked up.
0:20:20.540000 - 0:20:21.540000::What about the weight gain?
0:20:21.540000 - 0:20:25.060000::He's gained about 300 pounds.
0:20:26.060000 - 0:20:28.360000::He's drinking too much.
0:20:28.360000 - 0:20:31.760000::His leg is gangrene right now.
0:20:31.760000 - 0:20:34.760000::He's, what's that hat?
0:20:34.760000 - 0:20:41.560000::Oh, I just got some new fucking fire hats at a thrift store in Wisconsin.
0:20:41.560000 - 0:20:45.160000::This one's called Ambush Paintball.
0:20:45.160000 - 0:20:49.740000::I can't read what that says, but it's a paintball place.
0:20:49.740000 - 0:20:54.020000::And I'll tell you this, maybe people are noticing, but yes, there's a ring of sweat forming
0:20:54.020000 - 0:21:01.180000::on me as if I've gone for a run as if I'm like a CIA agent training in DC.
0:21:01.180000 - 0:21:03.660000::Remember how they got all sweaty in the winter?
0:21:03.660000 - 0:21:07.740000::Yeah, that's what I fucking look like right now, but I'm just sitting in a room.
0:21:07.740000 - 0:21:11.900000::Eric, can you put your hat up to the camera real quick for just a second?
0:21:11.900000 - 0:21:15.660000::Okay, because I know there's a lot of designers that listen to this podcast and I just need
0:21:15.660000 - 0:21:16.660000::to make a note.
0:21:16.660000 - 0:21:22.540000::Do you see that little rope thing that's at like the bottom of the room right there?
0:21:22.540000 - 0:21:29.740000::It's on a lot of like, I don't know, like, the little rope that's right there.
0:21:29.740000 - 0:21:31.140000::Do you have a rope?
0:21:31.140000 - 0:21:36.380000::It's barely visible, but we need, I just got to say I don't fuck with the rope.
0:21:36.380000 - 0:21:41.260000::And I feel like a lot of hats, there's been a rope on a hat that I've not bought and
0:21:41.260000 - 0:21:45.340000::just because there's a rope right between the broom and the top part.
0:21:45.340000 - 0:21:46.900000::So let's just cut that shit out.
0:21:46.900000 - 0:21:47.900000::We don't need that.
0:21:47.900000 - 0:21:49.380000::What is the function of that?
0:21:49.380000 - 0:21:50.380000::Let me just say this.
0:21:50.380000 - 0:21:52.100000::It ruins the design of some hats.
0:21:52.100000 - 0:21:56.580000::So if there's any hat designers out there and you're thinking about putting a rope, don't
0:21:56.580000 - 0:21:57.580000::just don't put it.
0:21:57.580000 - 0:22:00.780000::Now, let me put that on the flip side.
0:22:00.780000 - 0:22:05.380000::If you're a rope designer and you think about putting a hat on the end of it instead of
0:22:05.380000 - 0:22:10.300000::a knot or something, oh shit.
0:22:10.300000 - 0:22:11.300000::That's something I could get into.
0:22:11.300000 - 0:22:13.100000::But it's not all negativity.
0:22:13.100000 - 0:22:16.660000::Size, I think is, because I don't mind the rope on this, but trust me, I've seen a
0:22:16.660000 - 0:22:20.260000::hat with a rope on it before I'm not buying it because of that fucking rope.
0:22:20.260000 - 0:22:21.260000::Yeah.
0:22:21.260000 - 0:22:22.260000::Let's talk.
0:22:22.260000 - 0:22:25.220000::So you're all fucking sick in the hospital.
0:22:25.220000 - 0:22:29.620000::Have you thought about what you've done that made you get here first?
0:22:29.620000 - 0:22:31.660000::A little tough love to start this conversation.
0:22:31.660000 - 0:22:33.220000::Some karma in hospitals.
0:22:33.220000 - 0:22:34.220000::Where were you?
0:22:34.220000 - 0:22:36.260000::What did you do that caused this?
0:22:36.260000 - 0:22:38.660000::And what could you have done to prevent this illness?
0:22:38.660000 - 0:22:40.940000::I just want to let you think about that first.
0:22:40.940000 - 0:22:43.860000::Take a little responsibility and then we can rock together.
0:22:43.860000 - 0:22:45.380000::Yeah, and then we can start having fun.
0:22:45.380000 - 0:22:50.620000::But first you have to take some responsibility because you got yourself in this fucking
0:22:50.620000 - 0:22:54.100000::situation, the way you ate with the way you acted with the stress in your life that
0:22:54.100000 - 0:22:56.900000::you imposed upon your life.
0:22:56.900000 - 0:22:57.900000::You got yourself here.
0:22:57.900000 - 0:22:58.900000::Right.
0:22:58.900000 - 0:22:59.900000::Let's be honest.
0:22:59.900000 - 0:23:05.020000::And if you knew you had some busted gene and up in the gene pool because of your ancestors,
0:23:05.020000 - 0:23:09.700000::that causes some, why don't you go get that all fixed?
0:23:09.700000 - 0:23:13.500000::I'm doing full body MRIs every fucking three weeks.
0:23:13.500000 - 0:23:18.660000::Do you know that's supposed to permanently damage your DNA?
0:23:18.660000 - 0:23:19.660000::Oh, what?
0:23:19.980000 - 0:23:20.980000::Like an MRI?
0:23:20.980000 - 0:23:22.620000::Well, that's what the celebrities are doing.
0:23:22.620000 - 0:23:25.180000::They're getting MRIs every fucking two minutes.
0:23:25.180000 - 0:23:27.020000::Oh, Zempek and MRIs.
0:23:27.020000 - 0:23:30.900000::Where are we going to invent a MRI machine?
0:23:30.900000 - 0:23:33.780000::We were going to do a special, oh yeah, what was that thing that we talked about?
0:23:33.780000 - 0:23:37.740000::Because we talked about, because they were, we were going to invent a like a MRI.
0:23:37.740000 - 0:23:38.740000::What was it like?
0:23:38.740000 - 0:23:40.140000::We were going to invent the classic car of MRIs.
0:23:40.140000 - 0:23:41.140000::So many fucking inventions.
0:23:41.140000 - 0:23:42.140000::We have so many ideas.
0:23:42.140000 - 0:23:44.140000::It's hard to remember.
0:23:44.140000 - 0:23:45.140000::We need to enter.
0:23:45.140000 - 0:23:46.140000::I don't remember that.
0:23:46.140000 - 0:23:48.140000::I can't remember either.
0:23:48.140000 - 0:23:51.260000::It's one of our pitching sessions.
0:23:51.260000 - 0:23:56.740000::Have you guys ever been in a hospital for an extended day?
0:23:56.740000 - 0:24:02.620000::No, I've never been, I've never spent like, you know, a week in a hospital.
0:24:02.620000 - 0:24:07.780000::The most I've spent is probably a day in a hospital.
0:24:07.780000 - 0:24:08.780000::A full day?
0:24:08.780000 - 0:24:09.780000::Wow.
0:24:09.780000 - 0:24:10.780000::Getting surgery.
0:24:10.780000 - 0:24:12.700000::Tonsils removed?
0:24:12.700000 - 0:24:17.420000::Getting my nose, no, a nose job, basically.
0:24:17.420000 - 0:24:21.900000::I didn't know if you were going to address this on the podcast, but I was trying to basically
0:24:21.900000 - 0:24:24.020000::get my nose really great.
0:24:24.020000 - 0:24:28.380000::And I had a nose job to make it just look like kind of fucked up.
0:24:28.380000 - 0:24:30.180000::What was it deviated?
0:24:30.180000 - 0:24:31.180000::No, I'm kidding.
0:24:31.180000 - 0:24:35.260000::I had a deviated septum and you had a deviated septum.
0:24:35.260000 - 0:24:38.420000::They basically kind of like drilling your nose to make it the holes bigger.
0:24:38.420000 - 0:24:40.540000::So you can dang, that's it.
0:24:40.540000 - 0:24:42.940000::They just get the drill bit and they just open it up a little.
0:24:42.940000 - 0:24:44.340000::I think that's what happens.
0:24:44.340000 - 0:24:45.340000::Oof.
0:24:45.340000 - 0:24:46.340000::Yeah.
0:24:46.580000 - 0:24:51.060000::Let me just say this about self diagnosis because I'm thinking about the nose.
0:24:51.060000 - 0:24:55.360000::I thought I had these things called nasal polyp for a long time because I looked at my
0:24:55.360000 - 0:24:58.700000::nose and you can kind of see that it, you know, you can't see all the way.
0:24:58.700000 - 0:25:00.060000::And I went into the EN2.

0:25:00 - 0:25:03.800000::when I was getting something done and I was like,
0:25:03.800000 - 0:25:05.840000::yeah, and I think I have those fucking nasal,
0:25:05.840000 - 0:25:07.600000::and he's like, nah, you don't.
0:25:07.600000 - 0:25:09.640000::He's like, you know, there's nothing that's pretty,
0:25:09.640000 - 0:25:11.680000::full clear pathway up there, brother.
0:25:11.680000 - 0:25:12.720000::You're all good.
0:25:12.720000 - 0:25:16.840000::And I just really maybe think, stop diagnosing yourself, okay?
0:25:17.800000 - 0:25:20.560000::Cause you might not know what's really going on.
0:25:20.560000 - 0:25:21.920000::Leave it to the doctors.
0:25:22.880000 - 0:25:26::And by the way, if you're a hypokondriac
0:25:26 - 0:25:28.480000::and you're worried about this and that and this,
0:25:28.560000 - 0:25:31.040000::physical ailment, let me stop you right there.
0:25:32 - 0:25:34.360000::Your body is the last thing you gotta worry about.
0:25:34.360000 - 0:25:36.600000::You need to start being a hypokondriac
0:25:36.600000 - 0:25:38.280000::about your personality traits.
0:25:38.280000 - 0:25:39.640000::It's everybody hate me.
0:25:39.640000 - 0:25:42.360000::Oh shit, did I just say a curse word in front of somebody
0:25:42.360000 - 0:25:43.920000::who's rich, you know what I'm saying?
0:25:43.920000 - 0:25:46.120000::Or a type of religious.
0:25:46.120000 - 0:25:47.200000::Right, did I just curse?
0:25:47.200000 - 0:25:48.800000::Yeah, my, what, what's that mean?
0:25:50.800000 - 0:25:51.600000::A cat curse?
0:25:51.600000 - 0:25:52.840000::Well, did you say a curse word that offended
0:25:52.840000 - 0:25:54.280000::that's their core cause they're religion?
0:25:54.280000 - 0:25:55.120000::I don't know.
0:25:59.280000 - 0:26:00.240000::What's going on, Jack?
0:26:00.240000 - 0:26:03.280000::Sarah's laughing at something in the corner.
0:26:08.320000 - 0:26:10.880000::Does she know she just disrupted the tire flow
0:26:10.880000 - 0:26:12.200000::of the podcast we're on to?
0:26:12.200000 - 0:26:14.280000::The flow of toxic episodes, fucking 30.
0:26:14.280000 - 0:26:18::Yeah, I don't think she understands the severity of
0:26:18 - 0:26:19::the moment.
0:26:19 - 0:26:21.280000::What do we gotta do to be taken seriously?
0:26:22.760000 - 0:26:23.760000::At this point, I don't know.
0:26:23.760000 - 0:26:25::I'm laughing over in the other room.
0:26:25 - 0:26:27.360000::We're not watching the new love on the spectrum thing.
0:26:29.320000 - 0:26:30.160000::Relax.
0:26:30.160000 - 0:26:32.440000::It's when you know what it is, there's a lack of respect
0:26:32.440000 - 0:26:35.840000::and how do you gain respect through fear?
0:26:35.840000 - 0:26:37.960000::And nobody fears us because we're too peaceful
0:26:37.960000 - 0:26:40.080000::and where there's too much joy going on.
0:26:40.080000 - 0:26:43.600000::And I feel like we might have to change it up a little bit
0:26:43.600000 - 0:26:46.680000::because people don't respect us because we're too nice.
0:26:46.680000 - 0:26:47.760000::We're the nice guys.
0:26:47.760000 - 0:26:49.440000::The nice guys always finish last.
0:26:49.440000 - 0:26:53.320000::Do you think it's sound like call this shit tactics?
0:26:53.320000 - 0:26:55::Yeah, fucking respect.
0:26:55 - 0:26:57.360000::Yeah, respect tactics.
0:26:57.360000 - 0:26:58.200000::Oh, that's an annoying guy.
0:26:58.200000 - 0:27:00.480000::You know what I did in high school.
0:27:00.480000 - 0:27:01.800000::Shaking fear.
0:27:01.800000 - 0:27:04.200000::I didn't feel like I was being taking seriously enough
0:27:04.200000 - 0:27:05.440000::in my senior year.
0:27:05.440000 - 0:27:06.960000::I mean, I think I've told us a million times,
0:27:06.960000 - 0:27:07.960000::but I took the,
0:27:07.960000 - 0:27:10.360000::I started taking the violence with change my personality.
0:27:10.360000 - 0:27:12.040000::But I was like tired of people.
0:27:12.040000 - 0:27:14.160000::I was kind of, you know, joking so much around.
0:27:14.160000 - 0:27:16.480000::I didn't want to be seen as the jokes to her anymore.
0:27:16.480000 - 0:27:21::So I became extremely serious and I would not talk.
0:27:21 - 0:27:23.280000::I would be silent for days.
0:27:23.280000 - 0:27:24.560000::And people would be have to ask me like,
0:27:24.560000 - 0:27:25.400000::what's going on here?
0:27:25.400000 - 0:27:26.240000::Are you okay?
0:27:27.080000 - 0:27:28.560000::I'm fine, don't worry about me.
0:27:28.560000 - 0:27:30.240000::We need to get you back on vi-
0:27:30.240000 - 0:27:31.040000::Vi-
0:27:31.040000 - 0:27:32.440000::I'm in the vivants.
0:27:32.440000 - 0:27:33.440000::Vavance.
0:27:33.440000 - 0:27:34.280000::Yeah.
0:27:34.280000 - 0:27:35.120000::What is vivants?
0:27:35.120000 - 0:27:36.320000::That is anxiety medication?
0:27:36.320000 - 0:27:38.920000::Vivants is a homeopathy.
0:27:38.920000 - 0:27:41.160000::Natural treatment for ADHD.
0:27:41.160000 - 0:27:42.240000::There's nothing wrong with it.
0:27:42.240000 - 0:27:43.280000::There's nothing kind of evil.
0:27:43.280000 - 0:27:44.960000::So it's a hat or all basically.
0:27:44.960000 - 0:27:47.200000::Yeah, it's an amphetamine, brah.
0:27:48.240000 - 0:27:50.840000::So you were all messed out trying to be silent
0:27:50.840000 - 0:27:52.840000::and messed out in high school.
0:27:52.840000 - 0:27:53.680000::Yeah.
0:27:53.680000 - 0:27:57.680000::So I went to the gym and biking on the stationary bike
0:27:57.680000 - 0:28:00.400000::for an hour at a time, going as fast as I could,
0:28:00.400000 - 0:28:02.640000::reading like Albert Camu.
0:28:02.640000 - 0:28:04.560000::I think I've already said all this shit.
0:28:04.560000 - 0:28:06.800000::But you know, you have to go through those times
0:28:06.800000 - 0:28:10.800000::in your life to become who you are.
0:28:10.800000 - 0:28:13.440000::And now if you're in a hospital right now,
0:28:13.440000 - 0:28:16.080000::you basically what you have just tapped into,
0:28:16.080000 - 0:28:18.040000::and I'm assuming you have amazing insurance.
0:28:18.040000 - 0:28:19.400000::And so what you've tapped into is basically
0:28:19.400000 - 0:28:21.320000::a government sponsored writers retreat.
0:28:21.320000 - 0:28:24.520000::So I don't want to see you in there being watching Netflix
0:28:24.520000 - 0:28:26.800000::as in that, make a musical album,

0:28:29.160000 - 0:28:31.960000::I know you got passion, I know you, what?
0:28:31.960000 - 0:28:35.280000::And then by the way, have you guys heard this before?
0:28:35.280000 - 0:28:37.440000::A setback is a set up for a comeback.
0:28:37.440000 - 0:28:38.280000::That's fucking right.
0:28:38.280000 - 0:28:39.360000::I haven't heard that before.
0:28:39.360000 - 0:28:40.360000::That's interesting.
0:28:40.360000 - 0:28:42.360000::I like that a lot actually.
0:28:42.360000 - 0:28:43.800000::It's made it up.
0:28:43.800000 - 0:28:47.640000::And I got to say this, if you're single up in that hospital,
0:28:47.640000 - 0:28:52.120000::there might be no better place to meet your partner.
0:28:52.120000 - 0:28:55.360000::And if you, because you guys are both at a low right now,
0:28:55.360000 - 0:28:58.600000::and maybe try to find someone that's not too,
0:28:58.600000 - 0:29:00.720000::that might have more time left, you know what I mean?
0:29:00.720000 - 0:29:04.440000::Because wow, I think we, everybody deserves love.
0:29:04.440000 - 0:29:06.720000::Even if they're terminal ill,
0:29:06.720000 - 0:29:08.840000::you got to protect your heart, you know what I mean?
0:29:08.840000 - 0:29:09.680000::A little bit.
0:29:09.680000 - 0:29:12.440000::So find someone who's just getting some knee surgery
0:29:12.440000 - 0:29:14.920000::or getting a fucking foot thing down, you know,
0:29:14.920000 - 0:29:18.200000::something minor and bond in the hospital together,
0:29:18.200000 - 0:29:21::hop up in the beds together, go crazy.
0:29:21 - 0:29:23.280000::I know what happens when the lights go,
0:29:23.280000 - 0:29:24.840000::when at night time in the hospital,
0:29:24.840000 - 0:29:27.520000::when the lights go down, they said that mood
0:29:27.520000 - 0:29:30.320000::about 10 o'clock every hospital goes down.
0:29:30.320000 - 0:29:31.680000::The lights go down, they dim.
0:29:31.680000 - 0:29:36.240000::All the doctors, all the nurses, they leap.
0:29:36.240000 - 0:29:37.760000::And it's just the patient.
0:29:37.760000 - 0:29:41.240000::And the lights on the, the lights on the sign outside,
0:29:41.240000 - 0:29:43.040000::it doesn't say, some of the letters turn off
0:29:43.040000 - 0:29:48.080000::and just says hot, hot, hot, hot,
0:29:48.080000 - 0:29:53.200000::it's like me on the hot,
0:29:53.200000 - 0:29:56.280000::I think I'm 40, you are at the edge of death.
0:29:56.280000 - 0:29:59.600000::That's one of the most, you possibly,

0:30:00 - 0:30:01.840000::You don't even know how horny you could be.
0:30:01.840000 - 0:30:02.680000::Oh, dude.
0:30:02.680000 - 0:30:04.800000::You did end the edge of death when you're on that last couple of days,
0:30:04.800000 - 0:30:06.800000::when you're on that hill, when your body's
0:30:06.800000 - 0:30:09.080000::you realize drifting that's consciousness.
0:30:09.800000 - 0:30:12.720000::That's why you don't really want to be in the room with a loved one when they cross over
0:30:12.720000 - 0:30:14.400000::because they're just, it's going to be a little awkward.
0:30:18.120000 - 0:30:20::You see somebody on the street who just got
0:30:20 - 0:30:21.800000::dored or something and they're going out.
0:30:21.840000 - 0:30:26.720000::They're just, they're just grabbing, taking their clothes off and just going on
0:30:26.720000 - 0:30:28.080000::to ask, going out to asphalt.
0:30:29.880000 - 0:30:30.800000::It's beautiful.
0:30:30.800000 - 0:30:34.480000::I mean, it's sad, but it's true as, as they say,
0:30:36 - 0:30:38.800000::I was shaking my ass this weekend dancing to some music.
0:30:39.160000 - 0:30:42.560000::And I was wearing my gray sweats and I was like, isn't this fun?
0:30:42.560000 - 0:30:44.080000::And I'm being like this right now.
0:30:44.400000 - 0:30:45.240000::And everybody's laughing.
0:30:45.240000 - 0:30:46.480000::And I'm like, am I doing that?
0:30:46.480000 - 0:30:48.120000::Am I shaking it that fucking hard?
0:30:48.120000 - 0:30:50.960000::And I'm like, this always seems to happen to me where I'm like,
0:30:50.960000 - 0:30:52.560000::people must be laughing at me.
0:30:52.960000 - 0:30:55.840000::As it turns out, I'd sat right on a fucking blueberry.
0:30:56.080000 - 0:30:58.280000::So I had shit all my ass.
0:31:00.800000 - 0:31:04.480000::You had a mysterious stain and it was probably dark in the club.
0:31:05.720000 - 0:31:08.560000::And that's you had a mysterious stain on your booty area.
0:31:08.560000 - 0:31:11.240000::And I felt like I'd never been able to shake the cheeks before.
0:31:11.240000 - 0:31:11.760000::You know what I mean?
0:31:11.760000 - 0:31:13.560000::And this time I was really getting them moved.
0:31:14.400000 - 0:31:14.920000::Yeah.
0:31:15.280000 - 0:31:19.760000::So this is one of the most relatable and inspiring stories I've ever heard.
0:31:20.200000 - 0:31:23.760000::You need to turn this into a movie or stand up bit.
0:31:26.280000 - 0:31:30.160000::You the story at the time I sat on a blueberry and I thought people liked my
0:31:30.160000 - 0:31:32.200000::torquing, but it was just because.
0:31:34.360000 - 0:31:34.960000::That's crazy.
0:31:35.600000 - 0:31:37.160000::Not everybody's sitting on a blueberry.
0:31:37.560000 - 0:31:37.880000::Good.
0:31:37.880000 - 0:31:39.960000::I don't know what you guys are eating the hospitals.
0:31:39.960000 - 0:31:42.800000::Probably some fucked up jello or.
0:31:44.120000 - 0:31:47.240000::So you know, actually, they were never inscribed when they're eating in the
0:31:47.240000 - 0:31:47.960000::cafeteria.
0:31:47.960000 - 0:31:49.320000::It always looks good to me.
0:31:50.320000 - 0:31:53.520000::You know, yeah, that stuff is always good.
0:31:53.520000 - 0:31:54.640000::It's kind of like the milk.
0:31:54.920000 - 0:31:59.120000::It's like Doritos, you know, it's just maybe it's not the most nutritious thing in the world.
0:31:59.560000 - 0:32:01.840000::But it's it's like cafeteria food.
0:32:01.840000 - 0:32:02.720000::It's like, really?
0:32:03.280000 - 0:32:06.440000::Doesn't cafeteria food actually all taste better than any other food on the planet?
0:32:06.440000 - 0:32:06.840000::Really?
0:32:07.200000 - 0:32:08.080000::It's a cafeteria.
0:32:08.080000 - 0:32:08.800000::It's a good.
0:32:08.800000 - 0:32:09.280000::Good.
0:32:09.520000 - 0:32:10.040000::Yeah.
0:32:11.560000 - 0:32:11.920000::Yeah.
0:32:13.600000 - 0:32:14.040000::What that?
0:32:14.040000 - 0:32:15.640000::What would a virtual ablo say?
0:32:15.680000 - 0:32:17.240000::You remember Virgil Ablo.
0:32:17.560000 - 0:32:18.040000::Right.
0:32:18.040000 - 0:32:18.520000::Right.
0:32:18.520000 - 0:32:18.800000::Personal.
0:32:19 - 0:32:19.760000::Your own friends.
0:32:19.760000 - 0:32:20.240000::Right.
0:32:20.960000 - 0:32:24.800000::He there's a video of him in front of a bus it up paint can, right?
0:32:25.440000 - 0:32:29.320000::And he's saying, um, you know, if I put this paint can,
0:32:29.320000 - 0:32:34.080000::resting piece by the way to him, if I put this big can in a all white gallery space,
0:32:34.080000 - 0:32:39.240000::all white room and put this on a pedestal, people would look at this can as if it were high
0:32:39.240000 - 0:32:39.720000::art.
0:32:39.920000 - 0:32:40.400000::Okay.
0:32:40.480000 - 0:32:41.480000::And they would treat it as such.
0:32:41.480000 - 0:32:42.720000::It would be valued much higher.
0:32:43.240000 - 0:32:48.040000::But if you put this paint can in a fucking on a shelf with a bunch of other fucked up
0:32:48.040000 - 0:32:51.880000::paint cans in a garage, no one's looking at that and thinking that's the,
0:32:52.960000 - 0:32:54.640000::that's a high value piece of art.
0:32:55.400000 - 0:32:59.080000::That's a similar mindset to the cafe.
0:32:59.080000 - 0:33:00.280000::How you should choose your friends.
0:33:00.280000 - 0:33:00.640000::Yeah.
0:33:01.400000 - 0:33:01.880000::Mm hmm.
0:33:02.400000 - 0:33:05.760000::You share how much environment that food is fucking good.
0:33:05.840000 - 0:33:11.480000::How much credit card dare you in because of trying to buy off white jeans and t-shirts
0:33:11.480000 - 0:33:12.080000::and hoodies?
0:33:12.160000 - 0:33:12.960000::It's not dead.
0:33:12.960000 - 0:33:15.880000::If it's, if it's, if there's going to be a return on the investment.
0:33:15.920000 - 0:33:16.360000::Okay.
0:33:16.520000 - 0:33:19.200000::So I don't talk about it like dead.
0:33:19.200000 - 0:33:20.960000::I talk about it as an investment.
0:33:20.960000 - 0:33:24.520000::You have like these sweat stains all over these really expensive like clothing.
0:33:24.520000 - 0:33:25.960000::You're trying to resell them on.
0:33:26.800000 - 0:33:30.400000::Poshmark for like thousands of dollars double what they're worth.
0:33:31.440000 - 0:33:32.320000::Oh my God.
0:33:32.320000 - 0:33:34.840000::They are because they have because they have a door into legend.
0:33:34.840000 - 0:33:35.440000::Eric.
0:33:35.960000 - 0:33:36.440000::Yeah.
0:33:36.560000 - 0:33:37.720000::And it kind of has an extra.
0:33:37.720000 - 0:33:42.480000::You know, if you sign something, if you were, if there was a, you know, a regular
0:33:43.280000 - 0:33:45.440000::free to the loom t-shirt, okay.
0:33:45.440000 - 0:33:46.320000::It was all sweaty.
0:33:46.320000 - 0:33:49.240000::It had like fucking vomit stains all over it.
0:33:49.320000 - 0:33:53.400000::And it had a signature on it that said, you know, um,
0:33:54.440000 - 0:33:57.480000::Jim could be Jim Hendrix or something, you know, yeah.
0:33:58.280000 - 0:33:59.120000::And
0:34:01.240000 - 0:34:02.360000::wait, did he die of it?
0:34:02.360000 - 0:34:03.480000::What did he die from?
0:34:04.120000 - 0:34:06.440000::Jim, he Hendrix, what did Hendrix die from?
0:34:06.440000 - 0:34:07.760000::Dude, this he died.

0:34:09.080000 - 0:34:09.480000::Okay.
0:34:09.480000 - 0:34:10.920000::Maybe that's why that popped in my head.
0:34:10.920000 - 0:34:14.960000::I said bomb and then I thought of, not a, okay, it's easy to different celebrity.
0:34:14.960000 - 0:34:17.880000::Let's say, um, uh, Ash and Kutcher.
0:34:18.440000 - 0:34:19.080000::He's a lot of him.
0:34:19.080000 - 0:34:20.560000::He signed this shirt, okay.
0:34:21.280000 - 0:34:23.640000::Then it has a whole new worth in, in, in median.
0:34:23.640000 - 0:34:28.720000::Then that whole fan base is like, man, like, maybe this shirt is worth, um, you
0:34:28.720000 - 0:34:30.080000::know, a couple thousand dollars.
0:34:30.120000 - 0:34:39::And I feel like we should say, if Gordon Ramsey would start autograph from popsicles
0:34:39.520000 - 0:34:41::or stuff.
0:34:41.880000 - 0:34:42.680000::Jordan Ramsey.
0:34:43.440000 - 0:34:43.960000::Is that right?
0:34:44.680000 - 0:34:45.760000::You say Jordan Ramsey?
0:34:45.760000 - 0:34:47.360000::No, no, it's like Gordon.
0:34:47.360000 - 0:34:47.560000::Man.
0:34:48.240000 - 0:34:49.080000::Oh, no, no.
0:34:50.480000 - 0:34:52.880000::Gordon Ramsey, I don't know.
0:34:52.920000 - 0:34:57.720000::There's something, there's something there about if you really like a food and you're at
0:34:57.720000 - 0:35:00::like a Gordon Ramsey restaurant or something, he comes out with us.

0:35:00 - 0:35:03.400000::thing of like Besham, in a squirter.
0:35:03.400000 - 0:35:06.960000::And he autographs.
0:35:06.960000 - 0:35:10.040000::What happened to autographs?
0:35:10.040000 - 0:35:11.720000::I've seen them.
0:35:11.720000 - 0:35:13.240000::I'm not sure.
0:35:13.240000 - 0:35:18.240000::But nobody, it's because everyone has iPhones, they can take pictures of the celebrity.
0:35:18.240000 - 0:35:19.880000::Back in the day, they didn't have phones.
0:35:19.880000 - 0:35:23.480000::So they wanted one thing that they can remember this celebrity bias.
0:35:23.480000 - 0:35:26.880000::They get an autograph and they have them sign anything on them.
0:35:26.880000 - 0:35:31.880000::Whether that be a body part of yours or a t-shirt.
0:35:31.880000 - 0:35:33.960000::Wow.
0:35:33.960000 - 0:35:36.800000::These new celebrities aren't signing, you know, they're not signing t-shirts.
0:35:36.800000 - 0:35:41.760000::Well by the way, the new celebrities don't have signatures worth fucking.
0:35:41.760000 - 0:35:46.840000::You look at the old timey's lab signatures and you're like, no, that's a fucking signature.
0:35:46.840000 - 0:35:50.360000::You look at the, if Timothy Shalame was giving out signatures right now, maybe his is
0:35:50.360000 - 0:35:51.360000::good actually.
0:35:51.360000 - 0:35:52.360000::But I don't know.
0:35:52.360000 - 0:35:53.680000::Addison Rae is giving out a signature.
0:35:53.680000 - 0:35:56.680000::You know, it's going to be the most busted.
0:35:56.680000 - 0:36:00.040000::It's going to be every letter is going to be a unicorn next to it.
0:36:00.040000 - 0:36:01.040000::It's not, it's not class.
0:36:01.040000 - 0:36:02.840000::He doesn't look like John Hancock.
0:36:02.840000 - 0:36:03.840000::Yeah.
0:36:03.840000 - 0:36:09.160000::And that's another thing with all of our might to get Ashen Kutcher on this podcast.
0:36:09.160000 - 0:36:12.720000::Like really give it an a fucking plus effort.
0:36:12.720000 - 0:36:13.720000::What do you think that entails?
0:36:13.720000 - 0:36:14.720000::Traffic King.
0:36:14.720000 - 0:36:15.720000::We can talk about all of this.
0:36:15.720000 - 0:36:18.960000::Oh, because he has that, that organization.
0:36:18.960000 - 0:36:24.160000::Oh, whatever he wants to talk about, doesn't have to be the bat that 70 show.
0:36:24.160000 - 0:36:28.200000::We should just go to his house really with me.
0:36:28.200000 - 0:36:29.200000::Le Kunis.
0:36:29.200000 - 0:36:31.200000::There's that who they they're in love.
0:36:31.200000 - 0:36:32.200000::That is right.
0:36:32.200000 - 0:36:35.920000::Talk about a power couple, dude, because she's the wicked witch of the West.
0:36:35.920000 - 0:36:36.920000::Am I wrong?
0:36:36.920000 - 0:36:39.240000::Is she in the new Oz movie?
0:36:39.240000 - 0:36:43.240000::It wasn't there an old one in like 2013 or something.
0:36:43.240000 - 0:36:44.240000::Was it?
0:36:44.240000 - 0:36:45.240000::And she plays it.
0:36:45.240000 - 0:36:49.440000::And there's that other guy and old James Franco one.
0:36:49.440000 - 0:36:51.480000::There was something.
0:36:51.480000 - 0:36:52.480000::Well, that's cool.
0:36:52.480000 - 0:36:53.880000::She's in another movie too.
0:36:53.880000 - 0:36:55.560000::Forget in Sarah Marshall.
0:36:55.560000 - 0:37:00.320000::Oh, that was a fucking movie.
0:37:00.320000 - 0:37:01.320000::Yeah.
0:37:01.320000 - 0:37:03.120000::That was a good ass movie.

0:37:06.520000 - 0:37:09.320000::I can't imagine that that's a healthy relationship.
0:37:09.320000 - 0:37:17.720000::Well, I think that we could, if we had to, if some Broadway producer came up to us and
0:37:17.720000 - 0:37:22.920000::we created joy tactics and musical, the first podcast to become a musical, do you think

0:37:46.080000 - 0:37:47.080000::Of course, we'd body it.
0:37:47.080000 - 0:37:52.760000::He could have been in the, we need to get in the zone of like being the first to do things.
0:37:52.760000 - 0:37:53.760000::You know what I'm saying?
0:37:53.760000 - 0:37:55.080000::Here's what the plot would be at the musical.

0:37:56.480000 - 0:37:57.720000::What would that be?
0:37:57.720000 - 0:37:59.800000::This would be a love letter to the loser.
0:37:59.800000 - 0:38:04.320000::A love letter to the neglected child, to the child who felt like he wasn't deserved
0:38:04.320000 - 0:38:05.480000::to be loved.
0:38:05.480000 - 0:38:11::The first act would be split up into even like shorter acts where that we're all seeing
0:38:11 - 0:38:12.760000::us as kids.
0:38:12.760000 - 0:38:19.360000::Which one of us being bullied in horrific ways and being bullied for whatever being out

0:38:43.320000 - 0:38:47.760000::There's nothing worse to me than seeing, I think I've already said this on this fucking
0:38:47.760000 - 0:38:51.520000::podcast, but I have to say it again, nothing worse than seeing a child play an adult in
0:38:51.520000 - 0:38:52.520000::a play.
0:38:52.520000 - 0:38:55.480000::I mean, an adult play a child in a play.

0:45:47.280000 - 0:45:50.360000::Something bad, something that really shocks you to your core
0:45:50.360000 - 0:45:52.160000::where you have to think like,
0:45:52.160000 - 0:45:54.280000::maybe I don't know if I have a lot of time left
0:45:54.280000 - 0:45:58.400000::and it kind of makes you appreciate your time in this life.
0:45:58.400000 - 0:46:01.440000::And if I get any more fucking wake up calls,

0:46:05.560000 - 0:46:06.400000::You know what I'm saying?
0:46:06.400000 - 0:46:09.960000::I'm getting a wake up call every fucker of some way or another.
0:46:09.960000 - 0:46:12.160000::Either it's a stranger that's God put right in front

0:46:20.360000 - 0:46:21.720000::It's enough, it's enough.
0:46:21.720000 - 0:46:23.200000::I get it.
0:46:23.200000 - 0:46:24.480000::I know what path I'm going down.
0:46:24.480000 - 0:46:26.880000::I've accepted it and I'm having a good time.
0:46:26.880000 - 0:46:29.760000::I'm here for a good time, not a long time, okay?
0:46:29.760000 - 0:46:31.440000::And if you guys want me around,
0:46:31.440000 - 0:46:34.760000::you're gonna have to strap my ass fucking down into a bed
0:46:34.760000 - 0:46:36.280000::and fucking let me go right away.
0:46:36.280000 - 0:46:39.840000::Hey, speaking of people being strapped down to stuff,
0:46:41.040000 - 0:46:43.960000::I've been getting a lot of polarized opinions about this.
0:46:43.960000 - 0:46:47.120000::So I was doxed recently by somebody that I trust,
0:46:47.120000 - 0:46:49.320000::by someone who I consider an employer,
0:46:49.320000 - 0:46:51.760000::by somebody who's in the room with me right now.
0:46:51.760000 - 0:46:55.320000::And what they did is they doxed not necessarily my location
0:46:55.320000 - 0:46:57.160000::because I was on an airplane and so you can't
0:46:57.160000 - 0:47:01.960000::because it's moving, but they did dox my person,
0:47:01.960000 - 0:47:04.880000::they did dox my behavior on the face
0:47:04.880000 - 0:47:06.720000::and the eyes on your mouth.
0:47:06.720000 - 0:47:10.080000::What happened is that is that I have a mask,
0:47:10.080000 - 0:47:11.880000::I put my sleeping mask over my eyes
0:47:11.880000 - 0:47:14.040000::when I'm on the airplane and then I put the strap
0:47:14.040000 - 0:47:17.760000::behind the seat, behind the headrest of the seat
0:47:17.760000 - 0:47:19.800000::so that my head is being...
0:47:19.800000 - 0:47:20.960000::Oh my God.
0:47:20.960000 - 0:47:21.960000::To the back of the seat.
0:47:21.960000 - 0:47:22.800000::What was that?
0:47:22.800000 - 0:47:24.400000::I don't know who was behind the seat.
0:47:24.400000 - 0:47:27.520000::Yes, so my head is glued to the thing.
0:47:27.520000 - 0:47:29.400000::The mask is strapped to the chair.
0:47:29.400000 - 0:47:32.200000::Yes, so when the plane's rocking back and forth
0:47:32.200000 - 0:47:34.680000::and I'm trying to sleep, I'm not going like this
0:47:34.680000 - 0:47:37.440000::because my head's strapped to the chair.
0:47:37.440000 - 0:47:38.440000::And I got...
0:47:38.440000 - 0:47:39.880000::So you get clearance from the person behind you
0:47:39.880000 - 0:47:41.920000::or you're just rocking with it no matter what?
0:47:41.920000 - 0:47:43.680000::I'm rocking with the strap because the strap is rocking me.
0:47:43.680000 - 0:47:44.520000::What if the seat...
0:47:44.520000 - 0:47:45.840000::I don't need these up there.
0:47:45.840000 - 0:47:46.680000::That's a good point.
0:47:46.680000 - 0:47:51.160000::No, your headrest is separate from the back of the chair.
0:47:51.160000 - 0:47:52.320000::It's just the head part.
0:47:52.320000 - 0:47:53.320000::I guess you're right.
0:47:53.320000 - 0:47:55.600000::The headrest is fucking yours.
0:47:55.600000 - 0:47:56.600000::It's not even the chair...
0:47:56.600000 - 0:47:57.840000::It's not even the front of the chair.
0:47:57.840000 - 0:47:58.840000::You know what I'm saying?
0:47:58.840000 - 0:47:59.840000::The back of the chair.
0:47:59.840000 - 0:48:00.840000::It's not on the back of the chair.
0:48:00.840000 - 0:48:02::It's on the back of the headrest.
0:48:02 - 0:48:03::There's a little space there.
0:48:03 - 0:48:04::It's too resting.
0:48:04 - 0:48:06.840000::And you felt violated by this?
0:48:06.840000 - 0:48:09.640000::I felt violated by it.
0:48:09.640000 - 0:48:10.640000::I didn't get consent.
0:48:10.640000 - 0:48:12.560000::I didn't give consent.
0:48:12.560000 - 0:48:18::And I received backlash from people who I know personally.
0:48:18 - 0:48:21.760000::I received support, obviously, from people I know personally as well.
0:48:21.760000 - 0:48:23.880000::But it was really two sides.
0:48:23.880000 - 0:48:26.400000::It was one side that was like, this scares the shit out of me.
0:48:26.400000 - 0:48:28.400000::You're out of your fucking mind.
0:48:28.400000 - 0:48:29.400000::You're fucking idiot.
0:48:29.400000 - 0:48:30.400000::I'm going to kill you.
0:48:30.400000 - 0:48:31.400000::I'm going to kill you.
0:48:31.400000 - 0:48:32.400000::I'm not going to like that.
0:48:32.400000 - 0:48:33.400000::No, nobody.
0:48:33.400000 - 0:48:34.400000::No.
0:48:34.400000 - 0:48:37.840000::But then the other side was, oh, I really can't wait to try that.
0:48:37.840000 - 0:48:38.840000::Oh, that's interesting.
0:48:38.840000 - 0:48:40.440000::That's a new concept.
0:48:40.440000 - 0:48:41.440000::Wow.
0:48:41.440000 - 0:48:44.640000::Well, Jack, you need to get used to this because you are...
0:48:44.640000 - 0:48:46.640000::You're a star now.
0:48:46.640000 - 0:48:48.440000::You're a star now as the world.
0:48:48.440000 - 0:48:49.440000::Yeah.
0:48:49.440000 - 0:48:50.440000::Yeah.
0:48:51.320000 - 0:48:54.040000::And people can take pictures of you wherever you go.
0:48:54.040000 - 0:48:55.520000::They can...
0:48:55.520000 - 0:48:56.920000::This is just getting used to it, man.
0:48:56.920000 - 0:48:57.920000::That's all I got to say.
0:48:57.920000 - 0:49:00.680000::This piece of you off, get ready, man, because your life is about to be full.
0:49:00.680000 - 0:49:01.680000::You know what?
0:49:01.680000 - 0:49:02.680000::Here's the difference, though, Nate.
0:49:02.680000 - 0:49:04.640000::And it's simpler, simpler.
0:49:04.640000 - 0:49:09.240000::It's similar to why you were mad at me in the beginning of this episode.
0:49:09.240000 - 0:49:16.080000::When I violated your rights as a human being and made an AI sentence with your voice.
0:49:16.080000 - 0:49:17.480000::That was wild.
0:49:17.480000 - 0:49:18.480000::And that is...
0:49:18.480000 - 0:49:19.480000::That's baby.
0:49:19.480000 - 0:49:22.960000::That's nothing compared to what's going to be around in even a year.
0:49:22.960000 - 0:49:23.960000::In one year.
0:49:23.960000 - 0:49:24.960000::Yeah.
0:49:24.960000 - 0:49:27::Man, I've been here in Squidward rap.
0:49:27 - 0:49:28.360000::Oh, Squidward's rock.
0:49:28.360000 - 0:49:29.360000::Oh, my God.
0:49:29.360000 - 0:49:30.360000::Plankton singing.
0:49:30.360000 - 0:49:32.800000::Plankton can sing like fucking David Cook.
0:49:32.800000 - 0:49:35.800000::In American Idol season six, whatever.

0:49:45.840000 - 0:49:46.840000::Really?
0:49:46.840000 - 0:49:47.840000::I don't know.
0:49:48.060000 - 0:49:48.920000::That's what it looks like.
0:49:48.920000 - 0:49:49.980000::Which one is David Archie Leda?

0:52:10.520000 - 0:52:16.440000::Really why is that because your smart have to be smart this telemarketing agency was a busted like
0:52:17.120000 - 0:52:21.560000::You know scam and they were having like Xcons and current cons
0:52:21.760000 - 0:52:27.620000::They were hiring whoever as long as they would make the calls and letting them do whatever and they were calling on
0:52:27.640000 - 0:52:34.400000::Be they were saying on behalf of the fraternal order of police but really like 90% went to them 10% went to the
0:52:34.400000 - 0:52:40.720000::Oh, I've gotten this call many times. Mm-hmm. Well, these people were fucking partying and these calls
0:52:40.720000 - 0:52:42.560000::I'm getting lit
0:52:42.840000 - 0:52:44.840000::Patrick J Pespis was doing heroin
0:52:45.800000 - 0:52:51.360000::That is getting lit. Yeah, so anyways go to go watch the love this show
0:52:51.360000 - 0:52:54.800000::Hopefully that'll be there when when you're out
0:52:55.760000 - 0:53:01.240000::Or maybe maybe they got internet in the hospital these days. You don't want to get on iPad. Maybe you're just working at the hospital
0:53:04.360000 - 0:53:07.360000::No, no one works at those. You know, we should make a
0:53:07.360000 - 0:53:12.640000::We should talk about some of the surgeons and the staff that are
0:53:13.480000 - 0:53:18.480000::Around these people because I feel like nurses and surgeons are some of the most
0:53:19.520000 - 0:53:23.940000::Depressed people on the planet because they are constantly surrounded by pain suffering
0:53:24.240000 - 0:53:31.880000::Illness darkness their entire day revolves around that and nobody thinks them nobody cares about them. I have a theory
0:53:32.400000 - 0:53:33.680000::What is that?
0:53:33.680000 - 0:53:40.640000::Okay, because I have some nurse friends and I actually don't think I have a single doctor friend
0:53:41.920000 - 0:53:49.920000::But I think what happens is that you quickly just become so iced ice cold to people's
0:53:51.200000 - 0:53:56.200000::Because you're just seeing so much of it. How could you every time someone's crying and pain?
0:53:56.760000 - 0:54:01.160000::Feel that human, you know, maybe there's some angels out there that that feel their whole career
0:54:01.160000 - 0:54:05.760000::But I have to imagine at some point that empathy goes down a little bit wait
0:54:05.760000 - 0:54:08.560000::I have to share this story. I just remind you oh
0:54:09.320000 - 0:54:11.320000::my parents
0:54:11.320000 - 0:54:15.600000::Met an angel in a hospital
0:54:18.360000 - 0:54:22.720000::This is one of their my this is one of their paranormal stories and
0:54:23.960000 - 0:54:30.320000::My parents claim to have met a angel in a hospital a real life angel
0:54:30.560000 - 0:54:32.560000::Okay
0:54:32.560000 - 0:54:40.960000::Okay, what did that happen and they were in the hospital for I forget who one of my grandparents was either like dying or
0:54:41.640000 - 0:54:43.640000::in the hospital for something and
0:54:44.120000 - 0:54:46.120000::They went up to the front desk and
0:54:47.240000 - 0:54:51.160000::There was somebody working there and they said oh like
0:54:51.680000 - 0:54:56.120000::How is my you know mother doing or something like that and the person the front desk said like
0:54:57 - 0:54:59.540000::They're gonna be okay. They're gonna be all right

0:55:00 - 0:55:06.560000::And then they went back and they got their name and everything and that person wasn't there.
0:55:06.560000 - 0:55:07.560000::No.
0:55:07.560000 - 0:55:13::And they asked the staff, hey, was there somebody named Penelope who worked at the front?
0:55:13 - 0:55:14::No.
0:55:14 - 0:55:18.040000::We have no record of somebody being named Penelope who works on the front desk.
0:55:18.040000 - 0:55:19.040000::What?
0:55:19.040000 - 0:55:21.480000::So who do you think that was?
0:55:21.480000 - 0:55:24.880000::What do you think happened in that situation?
0:55:24.880000 - 0:55:26.360000::That was an angel, right?
0:55:26.360000 - 0:55:30.360000::Because that's what my parents think.
0:55:30.360000 - 0:55:32.400000::Penelope, that angel.
0:55:32.400000 - 0:55:33.400000::What else could you say?
0:55:33.400000 - 0:55:34.400000::They got the name wrong?
0:55:34.400000 - 0:55:37.320000::You think an angel would choose the name Penelope?
0:55:37.320000 - 0:55:40.600000::Well, I made up that name because I forget the story details.
0:55:40.600000 - 0:55:43.360000::But that's, that's what you mean.
0:55:43.360000 - 0:55:44.360000::I don't know what you mean.
0:55:44.360000 - 0:55:45.360000::I don't know.
0:55:45.360000 - 0:55:46.360000::I don't know what you mean.
0:55:46.360000 - 0:55:47.360000::I don't know.
0:55:47.360000 - 0:55:48.360000::I don't know.
0:55:48.360000 - 0:55:49.360000::I don't know.

0:55:53.360000 - 0:55:54.360000::I don't know.
0:55:54.360000 - 0:55:58.360000::That's the hospital patient that got away from the room and was acting up.
0:55:58.360000 - 0:55:59.360000::Yeah.
0:55:59.360000 - 0:56:00.360000::There's no way.
0:56:00.360000 - 0:56:05.360000::No, I choose to believe that that was an angel.
0:56:05.360000 - 0:56:06.360000::That's amazing.
0:56:06.360000 - 0:56:07.360000::That's amazing.

0:56:16.360000 - 0:56:18.360000::I don't want to talk about that.

0:57:36.360000 - 0:57:41.360000::Jack, you could, you could do this with birdie.
0:57:41.360000 - 0:57:42.360000::Okay.

0:57:48.360000 - 0:57:49.360000::Never.
0:57:49.360000 - 0:57:51.360000::Get an empty egg carton.

0:57:57.360000 - 0:58:00.360000::And the cat has to, it's like, have you ever heard of food puzzles?
0:58:00.360000 - 0:58:01.360000::Yeah, of course.
0:58:01.360000 - 0:58:03.360000::Well aware of food puzzles.
0:58:03.360000 - 0:58:05.360000::You do them for yourself.
0:58:05.360000 - 0:58:10.360000::I do them for myself and I'm trying to eat less.
0:58:10.360000 - 0:58:15.360000::But it just, it just, you know, it's harder to get out and the cat has to kind of, like,
0:58:15.360000 - 0:58:19.360000::it's like a mental game that they have to play of like, how do I get this, you know,
0:58:19.360000 - 0:58:23.360000::treat out of the, out of the egg basket.
0:58:23.360000 - 0:58:28.360000::But it's just fun to watch them kind of their brains turning and they get a little bit better at it each time.
0:58:28.360000 - 0:58:35.360000::So it's been awesome just seeing my cat kind of learn a new thing and having some new
0:58:35.360000 - 0:58:39.360000::mental stimulation because God knows she's not getting enough of it.
0:58:39.360000 - 0:58:41.360000::Give it up for his dig.
0:58:41.360000 - 0:58:42.360000::Great.
