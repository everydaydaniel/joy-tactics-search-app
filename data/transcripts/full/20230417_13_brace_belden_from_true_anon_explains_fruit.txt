0:05:01.660000 - 0:05:05.560000::I think Hasbole should start to make it only fans.
0:05:05.560000 - 0:05:09.480000::And so we can have that as sort of like a legal alternative,
0:05:09.480000 - 0:05:12.800000::like a legal safe alternative for like perverts.
0:05:12.800000 - 0:05:13.640000::Okay, yeah.
0:05:13.640000 - 0:05:14.640000::They can just watch Hasbole.

0:05:25.360000 - 0:05:27.240000::I guess you're right because he'd have to be involved.
0:05:27.240000 - 0:05:28.640000::We can just say we have.
0:05:28.640000 - 0:05:34.120000::We could do what we could do is we could do a scam is where we do like a like how people
0:05:34.120000 - 0:05:36.120000::drop NFTs, but there's like really nothing there.
0:05:36.120000 - 0:05:37.120000::It's like worthless.
0:05:37.120000 - 0:05:40.120000::We can be like sign up pre order Hasbole's only fans.
0:05:40.120000 - 0:05:41.800000::Oh, that's a good one.

0:05:43.800000 - 0:05:47.400000::I think Hasbole, I want to say this before we continue talking about this.
0:05:47.400000 - 0:05:50.160000::I think Hasbole has ears to the ground.
0:05:50.160000 - 0:05:51.160000::He knows.
0:05:51.160000 - 0:05:52.160000::He knows.
0:05:52.160000 - 0:05:56.760000::He could mobilize people in every major city to green.
0:05:56.760000 - 0:05:59.880000::That fucking AR 15 take us out from two miles away.
0:05:59.880000 - 0:06:01.080000::Not a chance.

0:06:02.080000 - 0:06:03.080000::No.
0:06:03.080000 - 0:06:04.080000::I'd hurt him like a discus.
0:06:04.080000 - 0:06:05.600000::Well, though, he wouldn't even be there.
0:06:05.600000 - 0:06:06.600000::He would be.
0:06:06.600000 - 0:06:07.600000::I'd go to another con.
0:06:07.600000 - 0:06:08.600000::He has a gun.
0:06:08.600000 - 0:06:10.600000::And when you throw it in the air, I know.
0:06:10.600000 - 0:06:11.600000::But it's hard.
0:06:11.600000 - 0:06:12.600000::There's a thing about you throwing mini me.

0:07:01.040000 - 0:07:06.760000::Because you were kind of like listening to sounds and thinking, yeah, well, no, I'm 12.
0:07:06.760000 - 0:07:12.640000::And so the first thing I heard was baby genius, baby Mozart that's American life.
0:07:12.640000 - 0:07:13.640000::Wow.
0:07:13.640000 - 0:07:14.640000::Where you at?

0:07:18.880000 - 0:07:24.880000::I, it's seemed really easy to do.
0:07:24.880000 - 0:07:25.880000::And let me ask you this.
0:07:25.880000 - 0:07:28.240000::Are you, are you, because I talked to you today.

0:07:30.280000 - 0:07:35.680000::And you said, I was busy working on my podcast researching.
0:07:35.680000 - 0:07:37.360000::You are, this is not easy.

0:07:39.560000 - 0:07:43.760000::I will say our podcast, we chose, it was dumb.
0:07:43.760000 - 0:07:47.640000::Because I think a lot of podcasts, you can just get together and be like, trying to
0:07:47.640000 - 0:07:49.880000::figure out what like a labia is or whatever.
0:07:49.880000 - 0:07:50.880000::Yeah.
0:07:50.880000 - 0:07:57.840000::And for me, which I mean, I just got for a bit, but we did it dumb.
0:07:57.840000 - 0:08:01.200000::We did it stupid because like now I actually have to like read a bunch of shit and like make
0:08:01.200000 - 0:08:03.240000::up all these notes before we record.
0:08:03.240000 - 0:08:04.680000::He tricked yourself into going to school.

0:08:05.680000 - 0:08:09.240000::And so we kind of do, we tricked ourselves to, we don't do anything like that, but I do
0:08:09.240000 - 0:08:16.080000::feel like the basic act of having a podcast is genuinely well recessed as much work.
0:08:16.080000 - 0:08:17.080000::Yeah.
0:08:17.080000 - 0:08:19.400000::As what you're doing in terms of how much time it takes us to figure this stuff out.
0:08:19.400000 - 0:08:20.400000::It's like recess.
0:08:20.400000 - 0:08:21.400000::Yeah.

0:12:18.200000 - 0:12:21.800000::I had the type of haircut where it went up like this, like a wall up in front.
0:12:21.800000 - 0:12:22.800000::Yeah.
0:12:22.800000 - 0:12:23.800000::They're Ricky Martin.

0:12:30.840000 - 0:12:31.840000::I felt like I had this.
0:12:31.840000 - 0:12:32.840000::I didn't change it.
0:12:32.840000 - 0:12:33.840000::It's a high school.
0:12:33.840000 - 0:12:35.320000::Is that because you were in some sort of gang?
0:12:35.320000 - 0:12:36.320000::No.
0:12:36.320000 - 0:12:38.200000::I had no friends.

0:12:39.200000 - 0:12:40.200000::That's a gang, kind of.
0:12:40.200000 - 0:12:41.200000::Well, it's kind of a family gang.
0:12:41.200000 - 0:12:43.200000::That's kind of the real opposite of a gang.
0:12:43.200000 - 0:12:45.200000::I haven't nobody.

0:12:57.040000 - 0:12:59.200000::If you're in a gang, stop doing what you're doing.
0:12:59.200000 - 0:13:00.200000::Stop.
0:13:00.200000 - 0:13:01.200000::Stop doing it now.

0:13:41.960000 - 0:13:45.280000::That's somebody who took matters into his own hands and it may have not been a great
0:13:45.280000 - 0:13:46.280000::idea.
0:13:46.280000 - 0:13:47.280000::So what are the guardian angels?

0:16:04.440000 - 0:16:09::What the hell is this is this our technology is this from another universe?
0:16:09 - 0:16:11.320000::What the fuck is going on? Are you an interest in this shit?
0:16:11.320000 - 0:16:18.380000::I will say one thing I hate aliens fuck no, no, no, no, I'm not even kidding. I fucking hate

0:16:33.400000 - 0:16:35.720000::If they're real or not real, I hate them
0:16:35.720000 - 0:16:41.600000::I hate them if they are real even better because then there's something for me to focus my energies against but now hold on a second
0:16:41.600000 - 0:16:46.680000::I saw those navy videos. Yeah, I saw these navy videos. I don't know what the hell that is
0:16:46.680000 - 0:16:53.520000::But I think it is there's a lot of shit up there. You know what I'm saying? Yeah stars what stars?
0:16:53.520000 - 0:16:55.520000::Yeah, well I
0:16:55.520000 - 0:16:58.400000::Videos of stars I think it was a lot because they're pointed downwards
0:17:01.120000 - 0:17:07.160000::But I don't know what the hell that was but I think probably most of them are weather balloons
0:17:09.800000 - 0:17:15.800000::The balloons that can move at 900 miles an hour was going like this and interesting have you ever seen really fast wind?
0:17:16.440000 - 0:17:22.340000::You can't see wind you can't see them and I haven't made it but you can see the effects of wind that's a flag waves and
0:17:22.460000 - 0:17:26.460000::Except I don't know what the hell it is right now. Yeah, no hold on because
0:17:27.460000 - 0:17:32::Well, let me put you out of your comfort zone first thing. Okay, that definitely is doing it. All right
0:17:32 - 0:17:37.600000::Well, I apologize for that. You're comfort zone. I am comfortable in this zone because I'm a combat the hand-to-hand combat guy
0:17:37.940000 - 0:17:39.460000::however
0:17:39.460000 - 0:17:44.140000::I'll I would say this is joy tactics. I know who you saying you hate aliens and blah blah this and that
0:17:44.740000 - 0:17:49.140000::And I would just encourage you to consider a scenario right where you say that and
0:17:50.020000 - 0:17:54.860000::Alien here's it and they unzip the you know dark matter right in front of you
0:17:54.860000 - 0:17:59.580000::Yeah, and they popped a little head out and you see that they got one single tear coming down their face. Yeah
0:18:00.860000 - 0:18:02.860000::You would be ugly
0:18:04.140000 - 0:18:09.020000::Okay, but they that could mean happiness. Okay, but then but in this in this moment
0:18:09.020000 - 0:18:11.420000::They kind of say like raise that fuck me up
0:18:11.420000 - 0:18:16.220000::Well, I don't know what fuck means in their culture. It means they're communicating in your language
0:18:16.460000 - 0:18:20.740000::And then they take a fucking knife out and they put it in your fucking head and they say you know, you know
0:18:21.940000 - 0:18:26.260000::So it doesn't have so it came all the way to earth in a fucking spaceship that defies all
0:18:26.900000 - 0:18:30.060000::Matter of physics. Yeah, well
0:18:31.500000 - 0:18:37.100000::Well, all right well all right. It's a knife, but it explodes. Oh, well, it's something bad's gonna happen
0:18:37.100000 - 0:18:43.300000::Okay, hold on so the whole point it's like a it's it's like this the spatula from the first episode SpongeBob

0:22:19.240000 - 0:22:24.280000::Why don't we lead with that benefit of that were whatever is out there is protecting us and that loves us
0:22:24.280000 - 0:22:26.280000::What if their laws are different?

0:23:03.920000 - 0:23:08.240000::That's right. Well, this you know, just in the way the aliens are interacting with us these days
0:23:08.400000 - 0:23:12.320000::Yeah, if they put a bag over Eric's head and shut the rod up his ass and then Eric woke up and said

0:25:09.280000 - 0:25:13.360000::We were talking before the podcast about the unhealthiness
0:25:13.360000 - 0:25:14.280000::of veganism.

0:25:31.120000 - 0:25:32.320000::What'd you eat today, Nate?
0:25:32.320000 - 0:25:34.200000::Break down your diet today.
0:25:34.200000 - 0:25:37.200000::My diet today was, well, I started off the day
0:25:37.200000 - 0:25:41::with not eating breakfast because I was fasting, of course.
0:25:41 - 0:25:44.360000::And at around 2 p.m., I had a smoothie.
0:25:44.360000 - 0:25:45.640000::What did that smoothie consist of?
0:25:45.640000 - 0:25:50::Benanas, peaches, flaxseed, cacao, powder.
0:25:50 - 0:25:51.920000::You know, we're going walnuts in there.
0:25:51.920000 - 0:25:54.120000::We're getting some other.
0:25:54.120000 - 0:25:56.800000::No, we're not doing, we had some chia seeds in there.
0:25:56.800000 - 0:25:57.800000::And protein.
0:25:57.800000 - 0:25:59.920000::We're starting out the day, right?
0:25:59.920000 - 0:26:00.760000::You don't know what I'm saying.
0:26:00.760000 - 0:26:01.600000::No, no, no, no, no.
0:26:01.600000 - 0:26:04.400000::Where's the protein in the shakene?
0:26:04.400000 - 0:26:06.720000::Oh, that's coming later.
0:26:06.720000 - 0:26:08.440000::With a big amount of what's up with me.
0:26:08.440000 - 0:26:09.920000::Oh, that's lovely.
0:26:09.920000 - 0:26:10.760000::That'll do it.
0:26:10.760000 - 0:26:12.680000::Yeah, well, here's a little tip.
0:26:13.680000 - 0:26:15.640000::You put a little sliver of chicken in the smoothie.
0:26:15.640000 - 0:26:17.280000::And the smoothie, you won't even taste it,
0:26:17.280000 - 0:26:19.640000::but you can get that protein from it.
0:26:19.640000 - 0:26:21.400000::And if you do taste it, it'll taste better.
0:26:21.400000 - 0:26:24.720000::Because chicken meat is essentially thick chicken stock.
0:26:24.720000 - 0:26:26.520000::And chicken stock is used in everything.
0:26:26.520000 - 0:26:27.360000::It's soup.
0:26:27.360000 - 0:26:28.200000::It's a bullion.
0:26:28.200000 - 0:26:29.560000::Chickens are walkin' bullion.
0:26:29.560000 - 0:26:30.400000::Yeah.
0:26:30.400000 - 0:26:31.240000::Cubs.
0:26:31.240000 - 0:26:32.240000::I thought they're bullion.
0:26:32.240000 - 0:26:35.360000::We're breaking down the diets of our guests, everybody.
0:26:35.360000 - 0:26:36.200000::Would you, would you?
0:26:36.200000 - 0:26:37.040000::You want to know what I ate today?
0:26:37.040000 - 0:26:38.040000::You're badly, badly.
0:26:39.160000 - 0:26:41.640000::Well, I woke up, of course, 4 a.m.
0:26:41.640000 - 0:26:42.480000::Sure.
0:26:42.480000 - 0:26:43.320000::Did you really?
0:26:43.320000 - 0:26:45::No, I did, but that's because I went to sleep at 3.30
0:26:45 - 0:26:47.600000::and I wake up like, oh, I just fucked up thing.
0:26:47.600000 - 0:26:49.120000::I have parasomnia.
0:26:49.120000 - 0:26:52::So I wake up, I, let me sleep walk, basically.
0:26:52 - 0:26:55.920000::So I wake up like every night about an hour, hour and a half
0:26:55.920000 - 0:26:57.520000::after I actually fall asleep.
0:26:57.520000 - 0:26:58.960000::And a lot of the times,
0:26:59 - 0:26:59.800000::I'm not joking.
0:26:59.800000 - 0:27:02.440000::I'll sleep walk and I'll eat.
0:27:02.440000 - 0:27:05.760000::And so I had to stop buying any food that could be just eaten
0:27:05.760000 - 0:27:08.200000::without having to be prepared.
0:27:08.200000 - 0:27:11.440000::But I had some nuts in the back of my fucking,
0:27:11.440000 - 0:27:16.440000::I guess cashews in the back of my fucking cabinet.
0:27:18.720000 - 0:27:20.760000::And I got that shit out and I ate a little bit of it.
0:27:20.760000 - 0:27:22.800000::And so do you have a faint memory of eating this?
0:27:22.800000 - 0:27:24.320000::Yeah, I know, wake up at the end.
0:27:24.320000 - 0:27:25.640000::And I'll just be in my kitchen.
0:27:25.640000 - 0:27:27.080000::I'll be like, it's weird, because it's like,
0:27:27.080000 - 0:27:28.080000::I'm not fully asleep.
0:27:28.080000 - 0:27:30.240000::It's like 85% of sleep, 15% awake.
0:27:30.240000 - 0:27:32.800000::So I'm like, I know I'm doing something,
0:27:32.800000 - 0:27:33.720000::but I don't really know what.
0:27:33.720000 - 0:27:35.440000::I'm like, this is good to do,
0:27:35.440000 - 0:27:37.440000::even though I don't eat late at night ever.
0:27:38.520000 - 0:27:40.240000::I might be doing that right now.
0:27:40.240000 - 0:27:42::Yeah, no, this isn't real.
0:27:42 - 0:27:43.960000::Oh, don't start saying that again, man.
0:27:43.960000 - 0:27:45.120000::Don't say that to me.
0:27:45.120000 - 0:27:46.800000::The lighting is too fucking a situation
0:27:46.800000 - 0:27:48.520000::and someone says it's not real.
0:27:48.520000 - 0:27:49.360000::I don't believe it.
0:27:49.360000 - 0:27:50.200000::I don't say that.
0:27:50.200000 - 0:27:53.600000::Well, you ever wake up from one of those and like,
0:27:53.600000 - 0:27:55.040000::is there any chance,
0:27:55.040000 - 0:27:56.440000::because you ever wake up in another room
0:27:56.440000 - 0:27:57.400000::that's not the kitchen?
0:27:57.400000 - 0:27:59.360000::Yeah, oh no, I mean, I've been,
0:27:59.360000 - 0:28:01.840000::I've worked out, I've paid in the toilet before.
0:28:01.840000 - 0:28:05.160000::So do you ever think, is it, you might be,

0:28:15.520000 - 0:28:17.400000::like it has to be like in a cabinet,

0:28:18.840000 - 0:28:21.040000::Like I won't have people to open up the fridge
0:28:21.040000 - 0:28:21.880000::and make something.
0:28:21.880000 - 0:28:22.720000::Okay.

0:28:43.120000 - 0:28:44.600000::like a psychiatrist, which I just,
0:28:44.600000 - 0:28:45.760000::I'm like, what is he gonna do?
0:28:45.760000 - 0:28:47.480000::I looked up what the cause of this is,
0:28:47.480000 - 0:28:49.120000::and I'm like, well, he's just gonna tell me I'm stressed out.
0:28:49.120000 - 0:28:50.720000::So, I'm not gonna go.
0:28:50.720000 - 0:28:51.560000::And what are you doing?

0:29:03.080000 - 0:29:05.320000::This is not counting.
0:29:05.320000 - 0:29:06.280000::Let's see here.
0:29:06.280000 - 0:29:11.280000::I meditated for 14 hours last month total.
0:29:12.640000 - 0:29:13.480000::Good God.
0:29:13.480000 - 0:29:15.760000::Wait, that doesn't sound like that much.
0:29:15.760000 - 0:29:17.160000::Do you, are you happy?
0:29:18.960000 - 0:29:19.800000::You know what?
0:29:19.800000 - 0:29:21.720000::I feel like I have to do it to,
0:29:21.720000 - 0:29:24.960000::to kind of get to the base level.
0:29:25 - 0:29:25.800000::You know what I'm saying?
0:29:25.800000 - 0:29:26.640000::Yeah.

0:29:28.640000 - 0:29:29.800000::I've tried to do it before,
0:29:29.800000 - 0:29:32.800000::and I have a hard time meditating.
0:29:32.800000 - 0:29:35.120000::So it is difficult to do,
0:29:35.120000 - 0:29:36.680000::but you just gotta,
0:29:36.680000 - 0:29:38.360000::you just really have to stick with it,
0:29:38.360000 - 0:29:40.920000::but it is highly beneficial.
0:29:40.920000 - 0:29:41.920000::Eric struggles with it.
0:29:41.920000 - 0:29:42.760000::I'll be honest,
0:29:42.760000 - 0:29:45.240000::I kinda don't do anything good for myself.

0:40:09.940000 - 0:40:10.940000::I couldn't even.
0:40:10.940000 - 0:40:13.740000::I didn't like that other movie he made either.
0:40:13.740000 - 0:40:14.580000::I can't remember the other.
0:40:14.580000 - 0:40:15.780000::You're gonna like the new one.
0:40:15.780000 - 0:40:16.620000::Oh, dude.
0:40:16.620000 - 0:40:17.460000::Oppenheimer?
0:40:17.460000 - 0:40:18.460000::Oppenheimer.
0:40:18.460000 - 0:40:19.300000::I like all movies.
0:40:19.300000 - 0:40:20.780000::I like anybody who makes a movie.
0:40:20.780000 - 0:40:21.620000::That's true.
0:40:21.620000 - 0:40:23.380000::I don't dare disrespect anybody who makes film.
0:40:23.380000 - 0:40:24.740000::Not even for a second.
0:40:24.740000 - 0:40:29.420000::When I first moved to LA, I told people that I moved there.
0:40:30.280000 - 0:40:33.840000::Because my uncle recently had to step down from his business
0:40:33.840000 - 0:40:35.640000::and they were trying to bring in new, like,
0:40:35.640000 - 0:40:37.680000::woke young blood there.
0:40:37.680000 - 0:40:39.080000::And through the course of the conversation,
0:40:39.080000 - 0:40:40.840000::I would make it very apparent that the uncle
0:40:40.840000 - 0:40:42.240000::I was talking about was Harvey Weinstein.
0:40:42.240000 - 0:40:43.800000::No.
0:40:43.800000 - 0:40:45.200000::You're kind of a social trickster.
0:40:45.200000 - 0:40:47.280000::You mean people, well, I had two lies.
0:40:47.280000 - 0:40:48.120000::I got that dog.
0:40:48.120000 - 0:40:49.400000::That was one of the lies.
0:40:49.400000 - 0:40:53.280000::And the other lie, which was I actually regret telling.
0:40:53.280000 - 0:40:56.080000::And I want to preface this with I regret telling this lie.
0:40:56.080000 - 0:40:58.640000::Do how many people I told it to.
0:40:58.640000 - 0:40:59.480000::All right.
0:40:59.880000 - 0:41:03.200000::Because I told this lie to a lot of people
0:41:03.200000 - 0:41:08.200000::was that I had a sexual experience from Phoebe Bridgers.
0:41:08.200000 - 0:41:09.200000::From?
0:41:09.200000 - 0:41:10.200000::Yes.
0:41:10.200000 - 0:41:12.280000::From Phoebe Bridgers a long time ago.
0:41:12.280000 - 0:41:13.720000::I didn't really know who she was.
0:41:13.720000 - 0:41:14.560000::You just would tell.
0:41:14.560000 - 0:41:15.880000::And this was how long it was.
0:41:15.880000 - 0:41:16.720000::How long ago was it?
0:41:16.720000 - 0:41:17.720000::How could you do that?
0:41:17.720000 - 0:41:18.560000::Who is that?
0:41:18.560000 - 0:41:19.400000::Yeah.
0:41:19.400000 - 0:41:19.920000::She's like a singer.
0:41:19.920000 - 0:41:20.680000::No, yeah.
0:41:20.680000 - 0:41:23.640000::And who got famous for a sort of writing a song about,
0:41:23.640000 - 0:41:27.160000::like her big hit was about, she was kind of like a me-to-ing song.
0:41:27.160000 - 0:41:30.080000::Is she the one who did the song for For Real?
0:41:30.080000 - 0:41:30.600000::Happy.
0:41:30.600000 - 0:41:34.600000::No, that is someone else.
0:41:34.600000 - 0:41:35.120000::OK.
0:41:35.120000 - 0:41:36.320000::What was your thing going on?
0:41:36.320000 - 0:41:39.080000::I told people that I hooked up with Phoebe Bridgers
0:41:39.080000 - 0:41:41.880000::and was rude to her after in 2013.
0:41:41.880000 - 0:41:43.200000::What the hell?
0:41:43.200000 - 0:41:44.080000::What you did?
0:41:44.080000 - 0:41:45.280000::So you got to meet yourself.
0:41:45.280000 - 0:41:47.440000::And the reason I'm rude, the reason I sort of,
0:41:47.440000 - 0:41:49.080000::well, I didn't say anything wrong.
0:41:49.080000 - 0:41:50.280000::I just said I was kind of asking for a reason.
0:41:50.280000 - 0:41:51.040000::You were kind of rude.
0:41:51.040000 - 0:41:51.560000::OK.
0:41:51.560000 - 0:41:52.280000::And you feel bad about it.
0:41:52.280000 - 0:41:52.800000::I felt bad.
0:41:52.800000 - 0:41:53.440000::Well, no.
0:41:53.440000 - 0:41:54.880000::I didn't feel bad about it.
0:41:54.880000 - 0:41:56.920000::Can you do it for us?
0:41:56.920000 - 0:41:58.720000::OK.
0:41:58.720000 - 0:41:59.560000::Dude, braced.

0:42:01.320000 - 0:42:02.560000::I feel like you're never out here.
0:42:02.560000 - 0:42:03.560000::Because what's up, man?
0:42:03.560000 - 0:42:05.640000::Are you, uh, getting into that?
0:42:05.640000 - 0:42:11.760000::It's kind of a funny story, but it's like a, it's, it's, it's, uh, like 2013.
0:42:11.760000 - 0:42:12.280000::OK.
0:42:12.280000 - 0:42:13.800000::At the Hamlock in San Francisco.
0:42:13.800000 - 0:42:14.480000::I love that place.
0:42:14.480000 - 0:42:18.760000::I hooked up with Phoebe Bridgers.
0:42:18.760000 - 0:42:19.800000::Oh my god.
0:42:19.800000 - 0:42:20.320000::From what?
0:42:20.320000 - 0:42:20.920000::The singer.
0:42:20.920000 - 0:42:21.440000::The singer.
0:42:21.440000 - 0:42:23::Oh, what genius.
0:42:23 - 0:42:25.600000::It was like, this is like, before she was famous.
0:42:25.600000 - 0:42:28.520000::And I was kind of an, I was like doing a like, Coke at a time.
0:42:28.520000 - 0:42:30.880000::I was like, really kind of, I was kind of an asshole to a lot of people.
0:42:30.880000 - 0:42:34.960000::I'm sure you remember, but like, I was an asshole to her as well.
0:42:34.960000 - 0:42:40.320000::And some pretty ways that I would not normally be, even kind of when I was being a dick.
0:42:40.320000 - 0:42:47::And, um, you know, my buddy plays, uh, in a band with a guy who's in her band.
0:42:47 - 0:42:51.920000::And she's writing a song with like, first and last name in it about the incident.
0:42:51.920000 - 0:42:56.560000::And I moved here to try to kind of like, prevent that from happening.
0:42:56.560000 - 0:42:59::Um, but it hasn't been working.
0:42:59 - 0:43:02.440000::It's like really, apparently it's like pretty far along in the process of getting put out
0:43:02.440000 - 0:43:03.920000::as a song.
0:43:03.920000 - 0:43:07.760000::And so I'm kind of just like here to like, I don't really want to be in San Francisco.
0:43:07.760000 - 0:43:08.760000::And this happens.
0:43:08.760000 - 0:43:10::I don't really want to be here when this happens.
0:43:10 - 0:43:11.400000::But I'm freaking out pretty bad.
0:43:11.400000 - 0:43:12.400000::Oh, nice.
0:43:12.400000 - 0:43:13.400000::What neighborhood are you in?
0:43:13.400000 - 0:43:15.080000::Uh, Highland Park.
0:43:15.080000 - 0:43:18.200000::And so then people would be like, really good to see you, man.
0:43:18.200000 - 0:43:19.200000::Yeah.
0:43:19.200000 - 0:43:20.200000::Awesome.
0:43:20.200000 - 0:43:23.040000::I'm like, oh, I'm lying.
0:43:23.040000 - 0:43:28.640000::And then people would think I was just lying about the, that's the reason I moved here.
0:43:28.640000 - 0:43:32.520000::They would think that I actually did hook up with her and was a dick to her in 2013.
0:43:32.520000 - 0:43:36.120000::What do you think is inside of you that prompts, prompts this?
0:43:36.120000 - 0:43:39::I don't, I really, I don't know.
0:43:39 - 0:43:43.480000::My whole life, I've told people like lies that made me look really bad.
0:43:43.480000 - 0:43:45.480000::But that was just to see their reactions.
0:43:45.480000 - 0:43:46.480000::Yeah.
0:43:46.480000 - 0:43:47.800000::That was just like, I'll tell you one.
0:43:47.800000 - 0:43:51.480000::I used to tell people after we stopped recording because it's too naughty.
0:43:51.480000 - 0:43:52.480000::Well, do you want to just do it?
0:43:52.480000 - 0:43:53.480000::We'll bleep it.
0:43:53.480000 - 0:43:54.480000::Do you want to do it?

0:56:42 - 0:56:45.560000::there are a few of his songs, even the most recent album where I
0:56:45.560000 - 0:56:47.840000::vibed, I like it like that.
0:56:47.840000 - 0:56:49.080000::It's good.
0:56:49.080000 - 0:56:51.560000::Against all odds, man, because you're tasting music.
0:56:51.560000 - 0:56:53.600000::It's not, it's very rare.
0:56:53.600000 - 0:56:54.600000::You can't be my music.

0:56:56.600000 - 0:56:58.600000::If an artist has a full human name, they're probably not going to get
0:56:58.600000 - 0:56:59.600000::onto Eric's Spotify.
0:56:59.600000 - 0:57:00.600000::I'll put it that way.

0:57:02.600000 - 0:57:06.600000::When I got interviewed on the Shenyan TV channel, I told them that
0:57:06.600000 - 0:57:10.600000::it was the most beautiful music I ever heard.
0:57:10.600000 - 0:57:13.600000::I thought that no music would feel the void that had left,
0:57:13.600000 - 0:57:15.600000::that a Vici had left.
0:57:15.600000 - 0:57:16.600000::You said this live?

0:57:20.600000 - 0:57:24.600000::pretty like down on music until, because after a Vici passed,
0:57:24.600000 - 0:57:27.600000::and then I heard the music that they played during Shenyan,
0:57:27.600000 - 0:57:28.600000::and it was incredible.
0:57:28.600000 - 0:57:30.600000::What did the interviewer say?
0:57:30.600000 - 0:57:33.600000::She asked me to repeat the name of the artist, and I said,
0:57:33.600000 - 0:57:34.600000::a Vici.
0:57:34.600000 - 0:57:35.600000::Can you repeat the name?
0:57:35.600000 - 0:57:36.600000::Well, you know what?
0:57:36.600000 - 0:57:38.600000::I was like, I was like, really trying not to laugh.

0:57:39.600000 - 0:57:41.600000::Well, you're trying not to cry.
0:57:41.600000 - 0:57:44.600000::You know, a Vici, we can still play with him through a video game.
0:57:44.600000 - 0:57:45.600000::There's an Vici video game.
0:57:45.600000 - 0:57:46.600000::There is.

0:58:52.600000 - 0:58:53.600000::Goats have six otters.
0:58:53.600000 - 0:58:54.600000::Like a cow.
0:58:54.600000 - 0:58:55.600000::Not from what I'm.
0:58:55.600000 - 0:58:56.600000::What kind of fuck that goat?

0:59:06.600000 - 0:59:10.600000::Like trying to joke, that's what I remember.
0:59:10.600000 - 0:59:13.600000::But they got six otters like a cow.
0:59:13.600000 - 0:59:24.600000::When you take it, when a milk is going to go, you saw what you pursued to be an otter.
0:59:24.600000 - 0:59:27.600000::I went to the Pioneer town on a field trip.
0:59:27.600000 - 0:59:28.600000::What?
0:59:28.600000 - 0:59:32.600000::It's called Pioneer Town and then they did all the things, the Pioneer way, like the cabins,
0:59:32.600000 - 0:59:35.600000::outside of Seattle, Washington about 30 miles.
0:59:35.600000 - 0:59:41.600000::And I remember going and milking the goat in it with just a one.
0:59:41.600000 - 0:59:42.600000::Okay, I had that one longer.
0:59:42.600000 - 0:59:44.600000::Where they behind the wall with a hole in it.
0:59:44.600000 - 0:59:45.600000::Yeah.

0:59:49.600000 - 0:59:52.600000::Where, where, where was the otter on the goat?
0:59:52.600000 - 0:59:53.600000::It was towards the back.
0:59:53.600000 - 0:59:54.600000::Uh-huh.
0:59:54.600000 - 0:59:58.600000::But maybe this is a false memory because literally I'm told.
0:59:58.600000 - 0:59:59.600000::You just jacked off the goat, man.

1:00:00 - 1:00:05.720000::Sorry, you got the boom source the back of the goat. Yeah, go jack. I guess I
1:00:06.960000 - 1:00:12.780000::Literally this is how I like what did you have to do? Well, it's probably not to pull it
1:00:16 - 1:00:20.880000::No, no, I mean I don't think I jerked a goat, but I think that
1:00:22.040000 - 1:00:27.360000::But you think this memory has made it so that I thought that I jerked it but really I just milked a female goat
1:00:27.840000 - 1:00:29.360000::normally
1:00:29.600000 - 1:00:31.600000::All right

1:06:55.920000 - 1:06:57.960000::So like what I'm saying is like, what if you just did a pot?
1:06:57.960000 - 1:07:00.200000::Like what if you did something that was kind of like a politics center,
1:07:00.200000 - 1:07:04.960000::Twitch stream and you play games, but you also maybe in a corner watched.
1:07:05.040000 - 1:07:05.880000::Hold on a second.

1:09:34.560000 - 1:09:35.560000::It's not as good as fun.

1:09:37.640000 - 1:09:39.640000::It was a wonderful crowd.
1:09:39.640000 - 1:09:44.080000::Everybody was going in and out of cars like sheep going into something coming out of
1:09:44.080000 - 1:09:46.320000::the other one, the end of it.
1:09:46.320000 - 1:09:52.120000::And it yeah, I felt I left with a crazy headache because it's just, you know,
1:09:52.120000 - 1:09:56.800000::5,000 people all getting in and out of cars together, all touching the same steering wheel.
1:09:56.800000 - 1:10:00.040000::And it's like the most interesting group of people who look like kind of.

1:10:00 - 1:10:04.380000::kind of biker gang people and then a bunch of acidic kids running all over the place
1:10:04.380000 - 1:10:10.500000::like Disney bugs and then a bunch of people doing performances. It was wonderful. And shout
1:10:10.500000 - 1:10:17.380000::out to, shout out to Volkswagen. I like their cars.
1:10:17.380000 - 1:10:24.380000::Interesting. I'll pass over. No, that was last week. Okay. But well, so spring has come.
1:10:24.380000 - 1:10:31.220000::Now it's just all right again. Well, there's a funny thing about the Jews is that that was in the past.

1:10:35.340000 - 1:10:43.540000::I mean, just that that shit doesn't go on anymore. That's the thing.
1:10:43.540000 - 1:10:51.220000::That's a, that's a, all right. I like Jewish people. I am one and I'm really good at sticking up for us in the moments like this.

1:11:09.460000 - 1:11:16.380000::We're not so bad. That's a good one. I would say a lot of people don't like us.
1:11:16.380000 - 1:11:20.860000::He starts crying. Yeah. And I understand that we did things to you.
1:11:20.860000 - 1:11:24.620000::He samples you on his next song. Yeah. But I'll say this.

1:11:51.820000 - 1:11:54.580000::Segway with that. It's okay. No, I've never thought about that.
1:11:54.580000 - 1:11:59.780000::Well, she's, she's gone anyways. She's dead. Well, she's passed.
1:11:59.780000 - 1:12:02.980000::For that. She's physically died or just passed out of the.
1:12:02.980000 - 1:12:06.220000::Oh, okay. Now it's joy tactics.
1:12:06.220000 - 1:12:10.740000::I'm worse than death. Sure. I've seen Shen. Yeah. Oh, yeah.
1:12:10.740000 - 1:12:14.620000::Oh, my God. That was that was the kind of the only fun thing I've done this week.
1:12:14.620000 - 1:12:18.900000::And I had a wonderful time. I got to talk. What?
1:12:18.900000 - 1:12:23.460000::Did they have snacks there? No, they really did not want you to eat or drink in the theater.
1:12:23.460000 - 1:12:29.660000::But I did buy a very expensive nuts for Liz and she ate them quietly.
1:12:30.500000 - 1:12:34.660000::And then the people behind us just ate chips that they bought.
1:12:34.660000 - 1:12:39.380000::So that's a crunchy chip. Well, hopefully they were doing it on the beat.
1:12:39.380000 - 1:12:46.260000::But, but I had a great time. I don't recommend anyone see it, but I recommend
1:12:46.260000 - 1:12:51.060000::imagining what it would be like and then take enjoy from that. Wow.
1:12:51.060000 - 1:12:56.980000::And what is that? I would say it's a, it was a dance that they reenacted organ harvesting.
1:12:57.220000 - 1:13:02.540000::No, they really? Yeah, they had like several like Fallon Gong practitioners in China.
1:13:02.540000 - 1:13:06.100000::That was like, it was like reenacting like doing like a protest profile Gong in China.
1:13:06.300000 - 1:13:12.820000::And then they had policeman dance out onto the stage, beat them up, take them to what
1:13:12.820000 - 1:13:18.700000::appeared to be Auschwitz, killed them and then doctors come out and dance harvest their organs.
1:13:19.060000 - 1:13:22.940000::Were the organs like ribbons? No, I was really disciplined. I thought that we're going to like,
1:13:23.100000 - 1:13:25.580000::but it was, it was, I got to say really low budget.
1:13:25.580000 - 1:13:28.660000::Now, there was no set. There was a big green screen behind or like a, like a,
1:13:28.660000 - 1:13:32.300000::like a crazy like screen behind them that they were interacting with.
1:13:32.300000 - 1:13:36.140000::Sometimes they would jump over this thing and then they would fly away on the screen
1:13:36.140000 - 1:13:40.660000::into the sky. It's nice. It's a cool effect, but they didn't have any props on the stage.
1:13:40.660000 - 1:13:42.860000::You can tie it up, except for a few swords. Yeah, it's sad.
1:13:42.860000 - 1:13:46.620000::Pretty, so I'll say this. Choose for yourself if you'd like to go see Shen Yen.
1:13:46.620000 - 1:13:48.980000::Yeah, because it could be one of the best days of your life.
1:13:48.980000 - 1:13:51.260000::It could be what it's statistically probably not.
1:13:51.260000 - 1:13:57.500000::Sometimes, sometimes the worst day you could have had is the worst day you've ever had is the best day you could have.
