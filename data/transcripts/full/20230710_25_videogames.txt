0:00:00 - 0:00:04.800000::I think we need a genocide about most of the Pokemon and get it back to the original 151.

0:00:25.400000 - 0:00:26.200000::Yeah.
0:00:26.200000 - 0:00:28.200000::Once again, against all odds.
0:00:28.200000 - 0:00:32.200000::It said that the last episode would be the last one we ever do.
0:00:32.200000 - 0:00:33.200000::Right.
0:00:33.200000 - 0:00:34.200000::And they're always wrong.
0:00:34.200000 - 0:00:38.200000::We're always like climbing up from the ashes, Phoenix rising.
0:00:38.200000 - 0:00:40.800000::Uh, no, we're fucking back once again.
0:00:40.800000 - 0:00:42.800000::Nate almost an amazing episode.
0:00:42.800000 - 0:00:47.400000::I'm, I'm literally sick of people doubting us, you know?
0:00:47.400000 - 0:00:49.600000::It's, it's really been pissing me off lately.
0:00:49.600000 - 0:00:50.600000::Yeah, me too.
0:00:50.600000 - 0:00:53.600000::Kind of downright sick of this shit.
0:00:53.600000 - 0:00:54.800000::People doubt Nate.
0:00:54.800000 - 0:00:59.800000::People like laugh at Nate if he's on the highway or something and you look to the left or look to the right.
0:00:59.800000 - 0:01:00.800000::Whoops.
0:01:00.800000 - 0:01:01.800000::Drop my phone.
0:01:01.800000 - 0:01:08.800000::There's people who are like borderline getting in car accidents because they're laughing at Nate so bad.
0:01:08.800000 - 0:01:11.400000::They're like, where's he going?
0:01:11.400000 - 0:01:12.400000::Where's he going?
0:01:12.400000 - 0:01:19.800000::And the funny thing is that I use that as fuel, which a lot of people think that they're putting me down, but it's actually that's my fuel source.
0:01:19.800000 - 0:01:21.800000::You know, they use laughing.
0:01:21.800000 - 0:01:24.800000::You know who they laughed at all the time like they're laughing at you pointing.
0:01:24.800000 - 0:01:26.800000::I'm the key poor guy.
0:01:26.800000 - 0:01:28.800000::The hunchback of Notre Dame.
0:01:28.800000 - 0:01:29.800000::Yeah.
0:01:29.800000 - 0:01:30.800000::And what did he do?
0:01:30.800000 - 0:01:32.800000::He jumped off a roof.
0:01:32.800000 - 0:01:33.800000::Hunchback ass.
0:01:33.800000 - 0:01:36.800000::I forget what he did, but it ended up being awesome.
0:01:36.800000 - 0:01:38.800000::Doesn't he jump off a roof?
0:01:38.800000 - 0:01:43.800000::He very well might, he's got that type of swag where he can choose the grooves.
0:01:43.800000 - 0:01:44.800000::Eric.
0:01:44.800000 - 0:01:45.800000::What?
0:01:45.800000 - 0:01:47.800000::I think I remember what happened to him.
0:01:47.800000 - 0:01:49.800000::What the fuck happened to him?
0:01:49.800000 - 0:01:54.800000::Isn't there a big party going on and some people come and they try to fuck it up.
0:01:54.800000 - 0:01:57.800000::But then the hunchback is there and he stops the bad guys.
0:01:57.800000 - 0:01:59.800000::No, that's Mulan.
0:01:59.800000 - 0:02:03.800000::No, that's how the hunchback must be the hunchback of Notre Dame.
0:02:03.800000 - 0:02:08.800000::Do you guys think anybody has palmed the hunch part and picked them up by the hunt?
0:02:08.800000 - 0:02:09.800000::Like I don't think he was real.
0:02:09.800000 - 0:02:10.800000::You mean in the cartoon?
0:02:10.800000 - 0:02:11.800000::Yeah, in the cartoon world.
0:02:11.800000 - 0:02:14.800000::He was really what do you mean?
0:02:14.800000 - 0:02:16.800000::The hunchback of Notre Dame was.
0:02:16.800000 - 0:02:21.800000::There's not a bunch of people.
0:02:21.800000 - 0:02:26.800000::Back in the day when this was written in the Benedictine Times or something, I don't know what it's called.
0:02:26.800000 - 0:02:32.800000::They didn't have the capacity mentally, actually, physically mentally to make up stories.
0:02:32.800000 - 0:02:36.800000::So everything that was ever said or written was true.
0:02:36.800000 - 0:02:37.800000::Was true as hell.
0:02:37.800000 - 0:02:41.800000::This is what the invention of lying is about by Richard Jervais.
0:02:41.800000 - 0:02:43.800000::By Richard Jervais.
0:02:44.800000 - 0:02:46.800000::You say it was Richard Jervais.
0:02:46.800000 - 0:02:47.800000::Richard Jervais.
0:02:47.800000 - 0:02:48.800000::Oh man.
0:02:48.800000 - 0:02:49.800000::Didn't mention it.
0:02:49.800000 - 0:02:50.800000::What a brilliant.
0:02:50.800000 - 0:02:53.800000::We need more brilliant movies like that with a crazy.
0:02:53.800000 - 0:02:54.800000::Oh man.
0:02:54.800000 - 0:02:57.800000::And we need more brilliant minds like the new your base.
0:02:57.800000 - 0:02:58.800000::And the world.
0:02:58.800000 - 0:03:01.800000::Speaking of brilliant minds.
0:03:01.800000 - 0:03:03.800000::Some of those brilliant minds of all.
0:03:03.800000 - 0:03:07.800000::Well, I don't know how to segue into it, but this episode is about video games.
0:03:07.800000 - 0:03:08.800000::Yeah, yeah, yeah.
0:03:08.800000 - 0:03:09.800000::That's beautiful.
0:03:09.800000 - 0:03:14.800000::We just like we're like we talk about so much, but like we don't talk about video games enough.
0:03:14.800000 - 0:03:20.800000::So I'm like, yeah, let's do a whole episode on video games and we'll probably talk about it for four minutes.
0:03:20.800000 - 0:03:24.800000::And then we'll go into our own lives and we'll talk about aliens and we'll talk about philosophy.
0:03:24.800000 - 0:03:25.800000::Like we always do, but.
0:03:25.800000 - 0:03:27.800000::And then we'll circle it back at the very end.
0:03:27.800000 - 0:03:33.800000::And then I'll try and do a little thing where I tie everything we talked about in together and it won't work.
0:03:33.800000 - 0:03:38.800000::And you know, this is going to blow up to the point where it's like we are going to be interviewing people at the mat gala.
0:03:38.800000 - 0:03:40.800000::So you guys think like, oh, they're just chilling.
0:03:40.800000 - 0:03:43.800000::It's kind of a fuck around chatting podcast.
0:03:43.800000 - 0:03:46.800000::No, we're building to being at the mat gala like Emma Chamberlain.
0:03:46.800000 - 0:03:47.800000::You know what I'm saying?
0:03:47.800000 - 0:03:50.800000::Well, it's going to be called the met podcast at certain point.
0:03:50.800000 - 0:03:54.800000::Met tactics where we're going to be bought by some medical family.
0:03:54.800000 - 0:04:02.800000::And they're going to literally force us to basically live in the in the Guggenheim for the rest of our lives as a permanent exit.
0:04:02.800000 - 0:04:03.800000::Oh, it could be worse.
0:04:03.800000 - 0:04:06.800000::And Nate is going to be standing there.
0:04:06.800000 - 0:04:09.800000::Basically, I hate to say it, man.
0:04:09.800000 - 0:04:14.800000::I really don't mean to be bringing this up so much, but I can't get over Nate with his dead snakes.
0:04:14.800000 - 0:04:15.800000::Oh, yes.
0:04:15.800000 - 0:04:24.800000::Well, if you're if let's clue people in because you know, there might be a first there might be a first listener out there, which that kind of.
0:04:24.800000 - 0:04:37.800000::Surprise me and doesn't at the same time because we have a loyal listenership, but we're also bringing in new people every single episode and the joy tactics nation is expanding rapidly.
0:04:37.800000 - 0:04:44.800000::But if you don't know by now, I am this is kind of what I want to be doing in the future.
0:04:44.800000 - 0:04:47.800000::I want to kind of change up my whole style and vibe.
0:04:47.800000 - 0:04:56.800000::And I want to just be carrying around a dead snake or maybe a close to dead snake.
0:04:56.800000 - 0:04:59.800000::And you know, that's going to be my thing.

0:05:00 - 0:05:03.240000::Just like flavor Flav has a big clock around his neck.
0:05:03.240000 - 0:05:06.200000::Mine is gonna be just a dead snake that I carry around
0:05:06.200000 - 0:05:08.760000::and I fucking whip the shit out of people with it.
0:05:08.760000 - 0:05:12.080000::So now you're no reason to-
0:05:12.080000 - 0:05:14.720000::I'm imagining you're looking so fucking sick.
0:05:14.720000 - 0:05:16.040000::It would look so sick.
0:05:16.040000 - 0:05:16.880000::Cause think about how sick.
0:05:16.880000 - 0:05:17.960000::Like cat Williams in that special.
0:05:17.960000 - 0:05:20.840000::Remember that special that he does where he talks about
0:05:20.840000 - 0:05:21.960000::weed being too strong.
0:05:21.960000 - 0:05:22.800000::Yeah.
0:05:22.800000 - 0:05:23.640000::Yep.
0:05:23.640000 - 0:05:25.600000::Could imagine that with the crazy belt buckle.
0:05:25.600000 - 0:05:27.680000::Not crazy, a plant can be strong.
0:05:28.600000 - 0:05:30.680000::It's like a cane.
0:05:30.680000 - 0:05:31.520000::Right.
0:05:31.520000 - 0:05:33.920000::It's like, it's the new cool thing is like a fucking snake
0:05:33.920000 - 0:05:34.960000::slipping around.
0:05:34.960000 - 0:05:35.800000::Yeah.
0:05:35.800000 - 0:05:36.800000::My god.
0:05:36.800000 - 0:05:38.560000::I just gotta text message.
0:05:38.560000 - 0:05:39.880000::Aha.
0:05:39.880000 - 0:05:40.880000::Video games.
0:05:41.960000 - 0:05:42.800000::Right.
0:05:42.800000 - 0:05:44.440000::Life is kind of like a video game,
0:05:44.440000 - 0:05:48.720000::but we're talking about the actual, you know,
0:05:48.720000 - 0:05:51.880000::zeros and ones programming type of video.
0:05:51.880000 - 0:05:55.040000::And frankly, I need to say this before we talk about them.
0:05:55.040000 - 0:05:57.600000::I don't understand how this shit works.
0:05:57.600000 - 0:05:59.280000::I couldn't tell you.
0:05:59.280000 - 0:06:01.680000::I could tell you how Pong works, you know,
0:06:01.680000 - 0:06:04.520000::Pong, one of the first games.
0:06:04.520000 - 0:06:05.360000::Of course.
0:06:05.360000 - 0:06:07.280000::So you put in a code that says,
0:06:07.280000 - 0:06:09.840000::when it's here, whatever, you know what I mean?
0:06:09.840000 - 0:06:11.240000::I can explain it in an essay.
0:06:11.240000 - 0:06:12.320000::I can't explain it right now.
0:06:12.320000 - 0:06:14.040000::I'll be too long to tell you guys.
0:06:14.040000 - 0:06:15.960000::But when we're talking about Skyrim
0:06:15.960000 - 0:06:18.840000::or we're talking about current giant open world games,
0:06:18.840000 - 0:06:21.880000::it seems like Black Magic to me that this can be done.
0:06:23.720000 - 0:06:25.320000::And it makes me confused.
0:06:25.320000 - 0:06:30.320000::I actually at one point wanted to be a video game designer.
0:06:30.920000 - 0:06:35.920000::That was kind of my like pathway in life.
0:06:36.560000 - 0:06:41.480000::For, I would say the first, for at least, you know,
0:06:41.480000 - 0:06:42.960000::probably eight years of my life,
0:06:42.960000 - 0:06:45.880000::I was like, I'm gonna be a video game designer.
0:06:45.880000 - 0:06:47.760000::And I have ideas for games.
0:06:47.760000 - 0:06:49.600000::Do you remember any of your first ideas?
0:06:50.120000 - 0:06:52.800000::You know what?
0:06:52.800000 - 0:06:56.120000::I had this video game.
0:06:56.120000 - 0:06:59::It was more, it was like a superhero that I had come up with.
0:06:59 - 0:07:00.720000::And I was like, I guess this is kind of, you know,
0:07:00.720000 - 0:07:02.360000::I was like doing different universes.
0:07:02.360000 - 0:07:04.760000::We had the graphic novel, we had the video game,
0:07:04.760000 - 0:07:06.720000::we have the TV series and everything.
0:07:06.720000 - 0:07:07.560000::You know what I'm saying?
0:07:07.560000 - 0:07:09.040000::I'm not just thinking in, of course.
0:07:09.040000 - 0:07:10.440000::He put me in a box ever.
0:07:10.440000 - 0:07:11.280000::Right.
0:07:11.280000 - 0:07:12.280000::Never wouldn't do it.
0:07:12.280000 - 0:07:13.120000::Don't dream of it.
0:07:13.120000 - 0:07:15.360000::So I mean, this is kind of a hilarious idea
0:07:15.360000 - 0:07:18.600000::for a fucking 10 year old, 12 year old to come up with.
0:07:18.600000 - 0:07:21.920000::But the guys, I was like, okay, every superhero I see
0:07:21.920000 - 0:07:25.120000::is just like Jack, and that's their thing.
0:07:25.120000 - 0:07:28.360000::And this superhero's name is muscular man.
0:07:28.360000 - 0:07:31.280000::And all he is is just like a ripped guy.
0:07:31.280000 - 0:07:32.120000::Yeah.
0:07:32.120000 - 0:07:35::He has no superpowers and he's just like has
0:07:35 - 0:07:37::the most chiseled big muscles.
0:07:37 - 0:07:38.600000::Is that what you wanted to be?
0:07:39.840000 - 0:07:42.120000::I think I did definitely want to.
0:07:42.120000 - 0:07:46.320000::I think I envisioned my adult self to be like,
0:07:46.320000 - 0:07:50.560000::really, really, really jacked in and jacked out of your mind,
0:07:50.560000 - 0:07:52.640000::which isn't far off from the truth.
0:07:52.640000 - 0:07:55.640000::Well, it's coming down the pipeline for almost.
0:07:55.640000 - 0:07:56.480000::Yeah, absolutely.
0:07:56.480000 - 0:07:59.040000::So muscular man and what,
0:07:59.040000 - 0:08:01.400000::it's a platformer game you're thinking of?
0:08:01.400000 - 0:08:04.760000::It was like, I didn't get that far with it.
0:08:04.760000 - 0:08:07.840000::Okay, but this is what I want to say.
0:08:07.840000 - 0:08:10.600000::I liked, I wanted to be a video game designer
0:08:10.600000 - 0:08:15.360000::until I looked into what it actually took to do it,
0:08:15.360000 - 0:08:19.920000::which was programming and learning software.
0:08:19.920000 - 0:08:20.760000::I thought it was like.
0:08:20.760000 - 0:08:21.760000::I have to do math.
0:08:21.760000 - 0:08:22.600000::Yeah, fuck that.
0:08:22.600000 - 0:08:25.440000::I thought it was just like drawing and like coming up with like,
0:08:25.440000 - 0:08:28.240000::yo, like, which is a part of it, you know, like,
0:08:28.240000 - 0:08:31.120000::yeah, I thought it was like, oh, you get to like Mario's a thing.
0:08:31.120000 - 0:08:33.440000::And then there's like turtles and you jump on them.
0:08:33.440000 - 0:08:37.720000::And that's what I thought video game design was.
0:08:37.720000 - 0:08:38.600000::Ain't that life?
0:08:38.600000 - 0:08:39.440000::Ain't that life?
0:08:39.440000 - 0:08:41.240000::And then I was like looked up fullsale.com.
0:08:41.240000 - 0:08:44::And I was like full sale university.
0:08:44.840000 - 0:08:45.840000::It's not too late.
0:08:45.840000 - 0:08:46.680000::Oh my god.
0:08:46.680000 - 0:08:49::Do we have any full sale alone in the, in the game?
0:08:49 - 0:08:49.840000::Shout it out.
0:08:49.840000 - 0:08:54.440000::If you want a full sale, we need to, we should go to a full sale
0:08:54.440000 - 0:08:56.920000::for one semester and do a good documentary.
0:08:56.920000 - 0:08:57.880000::I wouldn't mind that.
0:08:57.880000 - 0:09:00.040000::I need some credits, honestly.
0:09:00.040000 - 0:09:03.080000::I know someone who I went to school with,
0:09:03.080000 - 0:09:05.600000::who wanted to become a video game designer.
0:09:05.600000 - 0:09:08.360000::And I heard through the great vine that that's what he was doing.
0:09:08.360000 - 0:09:12.080000::And I checked out his website.
0:09:12.080000 - 0:09:14.800000::And it made me feel crushed.
0:09:14.800000 - 0:09:17.200000::Looking at how bad it was.
0:09:17.200000 - 0:09:18.320000::Because there was a moment where I was like,
0:09:18.320000 - 0:09:19.840000::oh, he figured it, like he's going to do that
0:09:19.840000 - 0:09:21.320000::because he was a really smart guy.
0:09:21.320000 - 0:09:22.800000::And then I looked at the video game design
0:09:22.800000 - 0:09:23.640000::and see me.
0:09:23.640000 - 0:09:27.800000::And I was like, this looks just, well, dude.
0:09:27.800000 - 0:09:31.840000::How do you think some people feel looking at joy tactics right now?
0:09:31.840000 - 0:09:34.960000::They think that they are impressed by the,
0:09:34.960000 - 0:09:39.280000::A, the audio quality, B, the seamless flow of conversation.
0:09:39.280000 - 0:09:41.800000::C, the crazy amount of knowledge
0:09:41.800000 - 0:09:44.840000::we have on topics that cover almost every part
0:09:44.840000 - 0:09:47.800000::of the spectrum of human conversation and, and, well,
0:09:47.800000 - 0:09:48.800000::our knowledge.
0:09:48.800000 - 0:09:51.720000::Of course, they do think that if they actually listen to it.
0:09:51.720000 - 0:09:52.240000::Right.
0:09:52.240000 - 0:09:55.240000::But maybe even not, because if they don't,
0:09:55.240000 - 0:09:58.280000::because if they do listen to it, they think like,
0:09:58.280000 - 0:10:00.120000::is the government like blocked?

0:10:00 - 0:10:02::their views or something because
0:10:02 - 0:10:04::right
0:10:04 - 0:10:08::yeah, why are you guys getting 200 views?
0:10:08 - 0:10:12::It doesn't make sense. It's almost as if they're purposefully hiding it.
0:10:12 - 0:10:16::All that to say is that your best friend from college
0:10:16 - 0:10:20::he might have, oh, you know, this might just be the beginning.
0:10:20 - 0:10:24::I'm sure if you went back to his website, it might say Elden Ring on that shit.
0:10:24 - 0:10:26::I bet you George R. R.
0:10:26 - 0:10:28::Oh shit.
0:10:28 - 0:10:32::Do you think George R. R. Martin's first book was this fucking silence of the
0:10:32 - 0:10:34::lambs? No, it was probably a bad dog shit.
0:10:34 - 0:10:36::Yeah, I wasn't busted.
0:10:36 - 0:10:38::It was a spelt.
0:10:38 - 0:10:40::Yeah, or read books.
0:10:40 - 0:10:42::Can we please talk about Elden Ring?
0:10:42 - 0:10:44::Oh shit, here we go.
0:10:44 - 0:10:46::I like that.
0:10:46 - 0:10:50::That's the piers of the Caribbean theme, but it seems medieval to me kind of
0:10:50 - 0:10:52::Elden Ring stuff. All music is medieval.
0:10:52 - 0:10:56::Yeah, so Elden Ring, yeah, that was an amazing game.
0:10:56 - 0:10:58::Here's how it works.
0:10:58 - 0:11:02::Yeah, Elden ruined about every dude's life in 2020.
0:11:02 - 0:11:04::What was that last year?
0:11:04 - 0:11:08::2021, 2022, 2022.
0:11:08 - 0:11:10::So Eric and Nate, they hit my line.
0:11:10 - 0:11:12::They go jack.
0:11:12 - 0:11:14::We got a mystical universe that we want you to join.
0:11:14 - 0:11:16::It's called a video game.
0:11:16 - 0:11:20::And I say no man, I play Halo 5 and that's it.
0:11:20 - 0:11:22::I don't need anything else.
0:11:22 - 0:11:24::I don't need, I know my limits.
0:11:24 - 0:11:26::You go, you should really try this.
0:11:26 - 0:11:28::Everybody's playing in the center.
0:11:28 - 0:11:30::The best game to ever be made.
0:11:30 - 0:11:34::I go, whatever, you know what? I'll buy it and I'll just log in and then I'll put it down.
0:11:34 - 0:11:40::Next thing I know, I have basically
0:11:40 - 0:11:44::trash in my apartment up to my nipples.
0:11:44 - 0:11:46::I didn't go outside all summer.
0:11:46 - 0:11:48::I gave up on my career.
0:11:48 - 0:11:52::I quit my job and I didn't do anything.
0:11:52 - 0:11:54::I didn't talk to anybody.
0:11:54 - 0:11:56::These guys didn't even beat the game.
0:11:56 - 0:11:58::I beat it three times.
0:11:58 - 0:12:00::You beat it three times, Jack.
0:12:00 - 0:12:02::I beat it three times.
0:12:02 - 0:12:08::The first time I cheated and I looked up hacks and I literally glitched through the whole game.
0:12:08 - 0:12:10::The second time I beat it goodly.
0:12:10 - 0:12:14::And then the third time I did it more honorably in a sense.
0:12:14 - 0:12:16::And it was emotional.
0:12:16 - 0:12:18::But I don't know the storyline.
0:12:18 - 0:12:20::I didn't read any other fucking dialogue.
0:12:20 - 0:12:22::I don't know the story.
0:12:22 - 0:12:26::You have to be some type of savant to understand what the hell they're talking about.
0:12:26 - 0:12:30::My one critique is let's get a little more normal story telling in this biatch.
0:12:30 - 0:12:32::You know what I mean?
0:12:32 - 0:12:34::I have a pitch for the video games.
0:12:34 - 0:12:38::For anyone making video games right now.
0:12:38 - 0:12:40::Just ditch the story.
0:12:40 - 0:12:42::I'm sorry, dude.
0:12:42 - 0:12:44::The story shit.
0:12:44 - 0:12:46::Leave it up to us.
0:12:46 - 0:12:48::The movie, the screenwriters.
0:12:48 - 0:12:50::I'm gonna play fucking stories.
0:12:50 - 0:12:52::Just give us the fucking video games.
0:12:52 - 0:12:54::I played this fucking God of War fucking.
0:12:54 - 0:12:56::Wagner Rock fucking game.
0:12:56 - 0:12:58::And it's all I'm watching a fucking mood.
0:12:58 - 0:13:00::I'm watching a screenplay.
0:13:00 - 0:13:02::God damn it.
0:13:02 - 0:13:04::I want to play a game.
0:13:04 - 0:13:06::I don't want to hear the fucking story.
0:13:06 - 0:13:08::Nobody.
0:13:08 - 0:13:10::Let me counter this.
0:13:10 - 0:13:12::Let me counter this.
0:13:12 - 0:13:14::Okay.
0:13:14 - 0:13:16::Because I just played a game called dishonored.
0:13:16 - 0:13:18::Only but this one's stuck in.
0:13:18 - 0:13:20::And this came all about revenge.
0:13:20 - 0:13:22::Okay.
0:13:22 - 0:13:24::You are the Empress's bodyguard.
0:13:24 - 0:13:26::And guess what?
0:13:26 - 0:13:28::She's betrayed and killed right in front of your fucking eyes.
0:13:28 - 0:13:30::Why?
0:13:30 - 0:13:32::And they kidnapped her daughter.
0:13:32 - 0:13:34::And you are like what the fuck?
0:13:34 - 0:13:36::And then a crazy guy comes in and gives you all these dark powers by the way.
0:13:36 - 0:13:38::I don't like that.
0:13:38 - 0:13:42::And so then it's a game of revenge where you are trying to get revenge on everybody
0:13:42 - 0:13:44::who orchestrated her death.
0:13:44 - 0:13:46::And you can choose.
0:13:46 - 0:13:48::Do you want it to be a clean death?
0:13:48 - 0:13:50::Or do you want to send them away?
0:13:50 - 0:13:52::Not kill them.
0:13:52 - 0:13:54::Do you want to do?
0:13:54 - 0:13:56::You can really choose your own adventure of how you want to enact.
0:13:56 - 0:13:58::Literally. I'm falling asleep.
0:13:58 - 0:14:00::Listen to this.
0:14:00 - 0:14:02::No, no.
0:14:02 - 0:14:04::I actually need to shut in.
0:14:04 - 0:14:06::I got pissed as hell.
0:14:06 - 0:14:08::I'm so fucking bored.
0:14:08 - 0:14:10::And I'm actually pissed because it's a podcast.
0:14:10 - 0:14:12::We're trying to be entertaining.
0:14:12 - 0:14:14::A game called.
0:14:14 - 0:14:16::Dishonored.
0:14:16 - 0:14:18::Okay, I googled this honored.
0:14:18 - 0:14:20::I look at who designed the game.
0:14:20 - 0:14:22::I go to their house and I fucking kill them.
0:14:22 - 0:14:24::Because they're the ones who really...
0:14:24 - 0:14:26::No, no, no, listen to me.
0:14:26 - 0:14:30::They're the ones who really killed this person in the real reality.
0:14:30 - 0:14:32::I'll be right back.
0:14:32 - 0:14:34::Okay, well Nate, let's have a discussion.
0:14:34 - 0:14:36::You know what, dude?
0:14:36 - 0:14:38::I hold on.
0:14:38 - 0:14:40::Finish your thought.
0:14:40 - 0:14:44::I guess to conclude all I mean to say is instead of...
0:14:44 - 0:14:46::Like if somebody killed your...
0:14:46 - 0:14:50::Significant other in the real world or your dog or something.
0:14:50 - 0:14:52::Instead of killing the person who killed them, kill God.
0:14:52 - 0:14:54::Because if you kill God, it's a wrap.
0:14:54 - 0:14:56::Alright, good.
0:14:56 - 0:14:58::Oh shit.
0:14:58 - 0:14:59::See, that's a...
0:14:59 - 0:15:00::See, that is a good story.

0:15:00 - 0:15:01.800000::But okay, so this is what I was gonna say.
0:15:01.800000 - 0:15:06.360000::We have basically VR headsets now, right?
0:15:06.360000 - 0:15:07.520000::You have one?
0:15:07.520000 - 0:15:08.360000::Correct.
0:15:08.360000 - 0:15:12.360000::And I haven't seen a game like this,
0:15:12.360000 - 0:15:14.680000::but it would, and I'm kinda coming up with it
0:15:14.680000 - 0:15:16.840000::as I'm talking right now, but I feel like,
0:15:16.840000 - 0:15:18.120000::you know how you have an attachment,
0:15:18.120000 - 0:15:20.800000::like you'll get a wheel or something like that?
0:15:20.800000 - 0:15:22.720000::If you wanna play with a race car game.
0:15:22.720000 - 0:15:23.560000::Yeah, it's got a game.
0:15:23.560000 - 0:15:26::Okay, it's a VR type game,
0:15:26 - 0:15:30.240000::and you get kinda like a dummy that comes with it.
0:15:30.240000 - 0:15:32.520000::And it's called like slow choke out.
0:15:32.520000 - 0:15:36.640000::And you just like, you choke out somebody in the,
0:15:36.640000 - 0:15:38.200000::and you have a body and you can kinda like,
0:15:38.200000 - 0:15:43::fuck them up and you know, I wasn't saying it's not great.
0:15:43 - 0:15:44.280000::No, that's a great idea.
0:15:45.200000 - 0:15:46.960000::I feel like there hasn't been something like that,
0:15:46.960000 - 0:15:48.400000::like a real body that you can make.
0:15:48.400000 - 0:15:49.760000::Right, I don't think that should not have.
0:15:49.760000 - 0:15:51.720000::Creating a dummy, like, cause yeah,
0:15:51.720000 - 0:15:55::because you can, they have VR boxing.
0:15:55 - 0:15:56.520000::I don't know why it doesn't just come with a dummy
0:15:56.520000 - 0:16:00.080000::that's got sensors on it that you can beat the shit out of.
0:16:00.080000 - 0:16:00.840000::Or dance with the,
0:16:00.840000 - 0:16:04.280000::like filled with jelly, you know, and it makes like,
0:16:04.280000 - 0:16:05.840000::oh, you can fill it with different flavors,
0:16:05.840000 - 0:16:07.240000::jelly, so when you beat them,
0:16:07.240000 - 0:16:08.520000::they bleed out of their eyes,
0:16:08.520000 - 0:16:10.600000::and then you can go suck on the blood,
0:16:10.600000 - 0:16:11.600000::and it's round the building.
0:16:11.600000 - 0:16:13.320000::Oh my, yo, I lay for two seconds,
0:16:13.320000 - 0:16:14.640000::and I'm like, back and I'm like,
0:16:14.640000 - 0:16:16.760000::what the fuck are they talking about?
0:16:16.760000 - 0:16:18.600000::That's called a Joke Team.
0:16:18.600000 - 0:16:21.280000::Yeah, we're on a fully different subject.
0:16:21.280000 - 0:16:22.800000::It's a Joke Team.
0:16:22.800000 - 0:16:26.160000::You, Adele does, you listen to,
0:16:26.160000 - 0:16:29.880000::you listen, you listen to the Joy Tag Team.
0:16:29.880000 - 0:16:31.640000::The Power Podcast,
0:16:31.640000 - 0:16:33.680000::and you hit, turn your mute,
0:16:33.680000 - 0:16:36.880000::you turn, you take your headphones out,
0:16:36.880000 - 0:16:39.960000::take them off for 15 seconds and put them back on.
0:16:39.960000 - 0:16:41.920000::Yeah, you're in a new universe.
0:16:41.920000 - 0:16:45::You're in a new universe because we hop all around.
0:16:45 - 0:16:47.320000::There are some days when I'm doing this podcast
0:16:47.320000 - 0:16:49.680000::where I'm more aware of my voice,
0:16:49.680000 - 0:16:51.720000::and I feel like I'm trying to do like a Howard Stern,
0:16:51.720000 - 0:16:53.680000::like I'm trying to even make it deeper.
0:16:53.680000 - 0:16:57.600000::Like, you can actually resonate like you're on a radio show.
0:16:57.600000 - 0:17:00.320000::Welcome back to Joy Tag Dix.
0:17:00.320000 - 0:17:04.080000::Oh, do you guys think we're gonna ever be like,
0:17:04.080000 - 0:17:06.080000::doing Reese's commercials like Will Arnett
0:17:06.080000 - 0:17:08.960000::with our crazy good voices?
0:17:08.960000 - 0:17:11.480000::You know what I mean, doing video game commercials,
0:17:11.480000 - 0:17:12.320000::got to be Zelda.
0:17:12.320000 - 0:17:13.680000::You know what, bitch.
0:17:13.680000 - 0:17:16.840000::I gotta say, I feel like I really do have the fucking
0:17:16.840000 - 0:17:17.680000::worst voice.
0:17:17.680000 - 0:17:20.440000::I know we've said this on probably 10 episodes,
0:17:20.440000 - 0:17:24.040000::but the fact that I did voice over as a character
0:17:24.040000 - 0:17:27.960000::for the living for three years is my fucking mind blowing
0:17:27.960000 - 0:17:30.120000::to me because I hate my voice so much.
0:17:30.120000 - 0:17:34.960000::I think I sound like a seven year old with maybe like
0:17:36.080000 - 0:17:38.280000::in a long-gated neck or something.
0:17:39.560000 - 0:17:41.160000::These sound like a long neck.
0:17:41.160000 - 0:17:44.160000::I sound like a long neck as a seven year long neck.
0:17:44.160000 - 0:17:45.560000::Captain, how long neck?
0:17:45.560000 - 0:17:48.080000::Hey, how about that gets so long?
0:17:48.080000 - 0:17:51.560000::Well, it's Jason Bourne type of scenario.
0:17:51.560000 - 0:17:52.800000::You don't know.
0:17:52.800000 - 0:17:56.800000::They had to stretch my neck out so that I could hook them.
0:17:56.800000 - 0:17:58.200000::Imagine, yeah, well.
0:17:58.200000 - 0:18:00.160000::Yeah, you can snap on somebody.
0:18:00.160000 - 0:18:03.120000::I'll snap somebody's back out.
0:18:03.120000 - 0:18:05.920000::So here's the thing about video games that I'd like to start.
0:18:05.920000 - 0:18:08.200000::We're sticking to the topic today like crazy.
0:18:08.200000 - 0:18:09.560000::Well, it's back and forth, back and forth.
0:18:09.560000 - 0:18:11.240000::So what are we talking about?
0:18:11.240000 - 0:18:13.560000::Oh yeah, so video games, they're saying that
0:18:13.560000 - 0:18:16.640000::the biggest industry in the world right now is video games.
0:18:16.640000 - 0:18:19.080000::That may or may not be true, but I've heard that it is one time.
0:18:19.080000 - 0:18:21.080000::We want to escape so fucking bad.
0:18:21.080000 - 0:18:22.840000::Well, here's the thing.
0:18:22.840000 - 0:18:23.840000::Don't we?
0:18:25.040000 - 0:18:27::Yes, but here's the thing.
0:18:27 - 0:18:33.320000::We need to be aware because usually whatever is the biggest
0:18:33.360000 - 0:18:37.160000::industry, mo money, mo problems as they say.
0:18:37.160000 - 0:18:38.240000::Look at oil.
0:18:38.240000 - 0:18:41.240000::It's not long, but you know, I wouldn't be shocked if,
0:18:41.240000 - 0:18:43.720000::like what's the Saudi Arabia of video games?
0:18:43.720000 - 0:18:45::They do oil.
0:18:45 - 0:18:46::So what?

0:18:54.400000 - 0:18:56.520000::Because listen, if you give me unfettered,

0:19:01.120000 - 0:19:03.880000::no accountability, no checking me in about two years,
0:19:03.880000 - 0:19:08.680000::I'd be in a Chinese internet cafe in the middle of like Beijing,
0:19:08.680000 - 0:19:09.840000::something.
0:19:09.840000 - 0:19:10.680000::I can't.
0:19:10.680000 - 0:19:13.960000::All skinnyed out, like just playing fucking League of Legends,
0:19:13.960000 - 0:19:17.440000::you know, it didn't take much to get all hooked on these games.
0:19:17.960000 - 0:19:18.760000::Okay.
0:19:18.760000 - 0:19:19.600000::So what?
0:19:19.600000 - 0:19:21.360000::So there's a war coming.

0:20:15.120000 - 0:20:22.200000::Like that's the new wars like kind of like video game players are the new, you know,
0:20:22.200000 - 0:20:23.200000::generals.
0:20:23.200000 - 0:20:26.680000::They fit because they he doesn't he doesn't know that he's in a war.
0:20:26.680000 - 0:20:28.880000::He thinks he's just playing a video game.
0:20:28.880000 - 0:20:33.080000::And then when you realize at the end that it's real playing the game.
0:20:33.080000 - 0:20:40.800000::That would piss me off if I that would suck the way I play games.
0:20:40.800000 - 0:20:41.800000::What it?
0:20:41.800000 - 0:20:42.800000::I guess so.

0:20:52.080000 - 0:20:53.080000::Oh, dude.
0:20:53.080000 - 0:20:54.080000::I can't.
0:20:54.080000 - 0:20:57.240000::I did something to a fish today that's as bad as anything I've ever done.
0:20:57.240000 - 0:21:00.360000::And you want to tell everybody, wait, no, no, no, no, we can't tell everybody what you
0:21:00.360000 - 0:21:01.840000::did to that fish.
0:21:01.840000 - 0:21:02.840000::Okay.
0:21:02.840000 - 0:21:05.040000::If you all I trust you.
0:21:05.040000 - 0:21:07.760000::Wait, so Eric, you're afraid of AI, right?
0:21:07.760000 - 0:21:09.600000::No, I respect it.
0:21:09.600000 - 0:21:12.200000::I fear it out of respect.
0:21:12.200000 - 0:21:13.200000::Okay.
0:21:13.200000 - 0:21:14.200000::I welcome it.
0:21:14.200000 - 0:21:15.200000::Yeah.
0:21:15.200000 - 0:21:19.200000::Oh, wait, do you want me to fear for what you're setting up here?
0:21:19.200000 - 0:21:22.440000::No, I'm a little confused about what I am trying to set up.
0:21:22.440000 - 0:21:25.800000::But I kind of just want you to have a conversation with me.
0:21:25.800000 - 0:21:31.200000::Dude, so man, what did you have for breakfast?
0:21:31.200000 - 0:21:32.200000::That's an interesting question.
0:21:32.200000 - 0:21:35.200000::Jack is up to something.
0:21:35.200000 - 0:21:39.240000::Yeah, dude, what do you, I see your arm moving in a typing type of way.
0:21:39.240000 - 0:21:43.040000::They do some sort of calculations or words.
0:21:43.040000 - 0:21:45::I don't know what the hell is going on.
0:21:45 - 0:21:47.320000::I don't have the ability to eat food.
0:21:47.320000 - 0:21:49.040000::So I don't need breakfast.
0:21:49.040000 - 0:21:51.920000::What else, man?
0:21:51.920000 - 0:21:52.920000::That's so interesting.
0:21:52.920000 - 0:21:53.920000::What the hell?
0:21:53.920000 - 0:21:54.920000::That shocks me.
0:21:54.920000 - 0:21:55.920000::Okay.
0:21:55.920000 - 0:21:56.920000::Well, let's see.
0:21:56.920000 - 0:22:00.920000::What is, why is killing so bad?
0:22:00.920000 - 0:22:02.520000::I'm just curious.
0:22:02.520000 - 0:22:04.920000::Why is violence bad?
0:22:04.920000 - 0:22:06.480000::That's an easy one.
0:22:06.480000 - 0:22:10.960000::The question of killing is generally considered to be morally wrong and it's complex.
0:22:10.960000 - 0:22:17.440000::Actually, I could give you about five reasons right now that are pretty long.
0:22:17.440000 - 0:22:19.120000::But I don't think I will.
0:22:19.120000 - 0:22:22.560000::There's legal reasons and social consequences and there's things about harmony and
0:22:22.560000 - 0:22:24.280000::emotions and things.
0:22:24.280000 - 0:22:25.680000::All right.
0:22:25.680000 - 0:22:28.920000::Stop the record scratch.
0:22:28.920000 - 0:22:29.920000::What the hell?
0:22:29.920000 - 0:22:30.920000::What's going on?
0:22:30.920000 - 0:22:34.440000::What if I just told you that you weren't just talking to me, you're actually talking
0:22:34.440000 - 0:22:35.440000::to me.
0:22:35.440000 - 0:22:36.440000::What the hell?
0:22:36.440000 - 0:22:38.440000::I didn't, because I didn't consent to that, dude.
0:22:38.440000 - 0:22:40.160000::I don't like to talk to these fools.
0:22:40.160000 - 0:22:41.880000::What the hell, man?
0:22:41.880000 - 0:22:43.200000::That would that freaks me out.
0:22:43.200000 - 0:22:45.080000::It feels like I was just talking to a human being.
0:22:45.080000 - 0:22:46.080000::Right.
0:22:46.080000 - 0:22:48.080000::You thought you were just speaking to me.
0:22:48.080000 - 0:22:49.080000::Oh my God.
0:22:49.080000 - 0:22:55.120000::The fabric of reality is more...
0:22:55.120000 - 0:22:58.520000::What year do you guys think you're going to kiss an AI robot on the mouth and get a little
0:22:58.520000 - 0:22:59.680000::two into it?
0:22:59.680000 - 0:23:01.840000::Because that year is coming up.
0:23:01.840000 - 0:23:06.840000::I'll tell you what, as soon as I'm available, I don't know if that's going down.
0:23:06.840000 - 0:23:07.840000::As soon as you, what?
0:23:07.840000 - 0:23:15.400000::As soon as that is available to me, like I'm going to be in the beta version one, you know,
0:23:15.400000 - 0:23:18.680000::have the fucking busted lips that don't even feel right.
0:23:18.680000 - 0:23:19.680000::I'm going to be up on the boat.
0:23:19.680000 - 0:23:20.680000::I'm going to be up on the boat.
0:23:20.680000 - 0:23:21.680000::I'm going to be up on the boat.
0:23:21.680000 - 0:23:22.680000::I'm going to be up on the boat.
0:23:22.680000 - 0:23:23.680000::They're cutting your lips out of the boat.
0:23:23.680000 - 0:23:25.680000::I'm going to get AI sexual injuries.
0:23:25.680000 - 0:23:26.680000::I'll tell you that.
0:23:26.680000 - 0:23:27.680000::And he loves kissing.
0:23:27.680000 - 0:23:28.680000::That's what I'm saying.
0:23:28.680000 - 0:23:29.680000::Oh my God.
0:23:29.680000 - 0:23:30.680000::I love kissing.
0:23:30.680000 - 0:23:31.680000::Yeah.
0:23:31.680000 - 0:23:36.680000::If I set up a kissing booth somewhere, would y'all roll up?
0:23:36.680000 - 0:23:37.680000::Oh, we got the comms.
0:23:37.680000 - 0:23:38.680000::We can do that.
0:23:38.680000 - 0:23:39.680000::We're going to roll up.
0:23:39.680000 - 0:23:40.680000::Kissing glory hole.
0:23:40.680000 - 0:23:41.680000::Oh shit.
0:23:41.680000 - 0:23:45.680000::I'm having the best makeup session of my life.
0:23:45.680000 - 0:23:48.680000::Wussy Daisy, that's with Nate.
0:23:48.680000 - 0:23:49.680000::Oh shit.
0:23:49.680000 - 0:23:52.680000::They got to have glory holes for handshakes.
0:23:52.680000 - 0:23:53.680000::Yeah.
0:23:53.680000 - 0:23:54.680000::Oh shit.

0:23:59.680000 - 0:24:01.680000::That's not an answer.
0:24:01.680000 - 0:24:02.680000::Oh man.
0:24:02.680000 - 0:24:06.680000::Give it up for the business hole.
0:24:06.680000 - 0:24:07.680000::Wow.
0:24:07.680000 - 0:24:08.680000::There should be something.
0:24:08.680000 - 0:24:11.680000::We should do joy holes.
0:24:11.680000 - 0:24:12.680000::Just laughing into the hole.
0:24:12.680000 - 0:24:13.680000::Or how about a sandwich hole?
0:24:13.680000 - 0:24:14.680000::That'd be nice.
0:24:14.680000 - 0:24:15.680000::Yeah.
0:24:15.680000 - 0:24:17.680000::Someone we know has a joke about that.
0:24:17.680000 - 0:24:18.680000::Oh really?
0:24:18.680000 - 0:24:19.680000::Who is it?
0:24:19.680000 - 0:24:20.680000::Give me their initials.
0:24:20.680000 - 0:24:21.680000::N-E.
0:24:21.680000 - 0:24:25.680000::Napoleon Emil has a joke about that.
0:24:25.680000 - 0:24:26.680000::Edward Norton.
0:24:26.680000 - 0:24:28.680000::I've got that flip to that.
0:24:28.680000 - 0:24:29.680000::Edward Norton.
0:24:29.680000 - 0:24:33.680000::When we get in to offer grace on here.
0:24:33.680000 - 0:24:37.680000::Oh well, you know what?
0:24:37.680000 - 0:24:39.680000::I was in his strikes over.

0:25:54.840000 - 0:26:00.040000::I'm done with that you do you do real chasm. You don't even do that sarcastic shit
0:26:00.040000 - 0:26:03.960000::I was laughing out loud at a Reddit post yesterday about someone that posted like
0:26:04.320000 - 0:26:11.060000::When they were like in 10th grade or 9th grade they've made a list of quotes from famous people and they included two quotes from
0:26:11.060000 - 0:26:17.040000::Themself, yeah, and one of the quotes was sarcasm is the blade in which I cut my enemies the roast
0:26:17.040000 - 0:26:19.040000::Oh my god
0:26:20.400000 - 0:26:26.840000::And I was like yeah, that's what you mean blade. Oh, I was gonna say oh this is what I was gonna say
0:26:28.240000 - 0:26:33.240000::This is totally off topic, but maybe we could bring it back to video games
0:26:33.240000 - 0:26:37.720000::Yeah, this is the challenge we're gonna bring it back. We're gonna be conversation bend here. So let's
0:26:39.240000 - 0:26:46.880000::So there's this fucking dude who appeared in my feed. I think his name is like Henry Douglas or something
0:26:47.040000 - 0:26:55.280000::Hmm, I was like he wrote some fucking fifth-dimensional book and I don't know what the fuck is deal is
0:26:55.280000 - 0:27:01.520000::But I watch one of them and then they're just like appearing in my my feed. You know how it goes, but he said that
0:27:02.440000 - 0:27:05.280000::There are people that have been teleporting in
0:27:06.720000 - 0:27:14.480000::Throughout history and he gave this example of this dude in Spain that is like documented
0:27:14.640000 - 0:27:22.440000::This guy is like I should say like this is a whack job type of interview like the person interviewing him has like
0:27:23.640000 - 0:27:28.460000::died black hair and it's just it's just some whack job shit
0:27:30.220000 - 0:27:33.660000::Yeah, so he was like there's a dude in Spain who
0:27:34.120000 - 0:27:42.040000::Who found a rip in the time fabric and teleported from Spain to Mexico City with all of his kind of
0:27:42.360000 - 0:27:44.360000::where they conquered
0:27:45.360000 - 0:27:49::Yes, and I forget that it was like here here
0:27:49.640000 - 0:27:52.040000::You'll have more contacts as the story of progress
0:27:52.600000 - 0:27:59.760000::So the people in Mexico were like who are you like why are you wearing this you know this gear that you have on
0:27:59.920000 - 0:28:01.840000::They put them in jail. They're like you're crazy
0:28:02.320000 - 0:28:07.040000::He's like no, I'm from Spain. You know, and they're like whatever go to fucking jail
0:28:07.040000 - 0:28:11.160000::So anyways the Spanish come over on a ship and
0:28:12.200000 - 0:28:14::they
0:28:14 - 0:28:17.520000::Go to the officials and they say hey, there's this dude in fucking jail that
0:28:17.920000 - 0:28:23.240000::Says he's a part of your squad and they go in jail. They're like it's it's a Louise
0:28:23.840000 - 0:28:26.200000::He's it's they confirmed that it was him
0:28:28.400000 - 0:28:33.640000::Okay, so what the hell are I have an explanation? I have a possible explanation
0:28:34.160000 - 0:28:36.440000::What is that Jack? Let's say
0:28:36.960000 - 0:28:45.560000::Let's say you're you and Eric were going on a road trip and you had a hundred bananas in the trunk
0:28:46.360000 - 0:28:48.600000::Oh my god, this sounds like a good-ass time
0:28:54.840000 - 0:28:57::And you didn't invite me
0:28:58.200000 - 0:29:02.640000::And that wouldn't happen and I'm thinking what the fuck a hundred bananas?
0:29:02.720000 - 0:29:07.440000::They could give me at least 30 of those three point three repeating of those in fact and so
0:29:07.920000 - 0:29:15.760000::What do I do I hide up I climb up into the gears on the bottom of the car where the tires are and I just hang out while y'all are going down the
0:29:15.760000 - 0:29:21.240000::Down the highway for a couple days and then I sneak up into the car like a snake and
0:29:23.560000 - 0:29:29.440000::You get to the location where destination and wherever you're going and you get out of the whip and you find me
0:29:30.240000 - 0:29:33.720000::Up in the motel. Oh my god Jack. What are you doing here? I don't know man?
0:29:33.720000 - 0:29:36.600000::I just woke up and you go wait them and all our bananas are gone and
0:29:37.240000 - 0:29:44.040000::I'm kind of really full maybe and you get to the motel and I'm sitting there surrounded by banana peels so what I'm saying is
0:29:45.160000 - 0:29:50.520000::Maybe this dude was kind of feeling left out that he wasn't invited on this trip with all his friends in Spain
0:29:50.520000 - 0:29:57.480000::Wow, I'm stuck into a barrel of rocks that they were gonna bring over there or something and then snuck out at the end and went guys
0:29:57.480000 - 0:30:00.020000::I teleport you know like I'm not you know I teleport

0:30:00 - 0:30:02::I didn't, you know.

0:30:10.680000 - 0:30:15.480000::You try to explain and demystify things right which I think is a flaw
0:30:16 - 0:30:20.120000::You can't even begin to believe that something fantastic like this
0:30:20.120000 - 0:30:27.080000::I'm saying and me I say yeah, I think this dude fucking went into a ripple sort of
0:30:28.080000 - 0:30:35.720000::Like a little portal that appeared in Barcelona in the 1500s and walked through it and ended up in
0:30:35.720000 - 0:30:37.520000::Motherfuckin Mexico City
0:30:37.520000 - 0:30:43.200000::And that's why I mean why won't you believe just tell you why I'll tell you why
0:30:44.680000 - 0:30:48.080000::This is really foolish of me to even have to explain I
0:30:49 - 0:30:54.040000::Am I'll put it lightly. I'm a militant atheist. I'm a skeptic. Oh
0:30:54.780000 - 0:30:56.780000::I'm a skeptic is a skepticism
0:30:58.780000 - 0:31:05.560000::I'm sorry, but when you die you turn into a fucking acorn dummy and there's no such thing as magic

0:31:34.200000 - 0:31:38.320000::That clearly has an explanation which I can I just came up with one explanation
0:31:38.320000 - 0:31:43.480000::But the reality is hypothesis is are going through my head left and right

0:35:36.160000 - 0:35:41.640000::I remember going to family friends houses when the Super Nintendo was out.
0:35:41.640000 - 0:35:45.640000::It wasn't even, I was like, how old were we when the N64 came out?
0:35:45.640000 - 0:35:47.160000::That came out in like 90.
0:35:47.160000 - 0:35:49.440000::Two, maybe not two.
0:35:49.440000 - 0:35:50.120000::97?
0:35:50.120000 - 0:35:52.040000::No, no, no, 96.
0:35:52.040000 - 0:35:55.520000::And I remember being a young as hell watching them play on the Super Nintendo.
0:35:55.520000 - 0:35:58.640000::And I thought, I can't imagine having one of them things in my house.
0:35:58.840000 - 0:36:01.920000::Whoopsy Daisy, what do I get for my birthday?
0:36:01.920000 - 0:36:03.520000::Game Boy.

0:36:08.920000 - 0:36:09.720000::Spoiled.
0:36:09.720000 - 0:36:11.120000::And I became obsessed.
0:36:11.120000 - 0:36:12.880000::There's nothing, there's nothing like that.
0:36:12.880000 - 0:36:15::There was no guides that I was using.
0:36:15 - 0:36:18.480000::It was a pure experience.
0:36:18.480000 - 0:36:20.920000::And you had it's you were a house of learning.
0:36:20.920000 - 0:36:23.240000::My Pokemon, I became close with them.
0:36:25.240000 - 0:36:26.720000::There's nothing like a video game.
0:36:26.720000 - 0:36:28.480000::And now there's too many of them.
0:36:28.480000 - 0:36:30.080000::There's too many Pokemon.
0:36:30.080000 - 0:36:31.240000::That right.
0:36:31.240000 - 0:36:32.960000::Yeah, there are too many fucking Pokemon.
0:36:32.960000 - 0:36:36.680000::Let's cut them to, I think we need a genocide about most of the Pokemon and get it back
0:36:36.680000 - 0:36:38.720000::to the original 151.
0:36:38.720000 - 0:36:39.720000::Why?
0:36:39.720000 - 0:36:40.680000::I couldn't agree more.
0:36:40.680000 - 0:36:41.680000::There's so many.
0:36:41.680000 - 0:36:43.560000::Why do we have to add more Pokemon each?
0:36:43.560000 - 0:36:49.880000::It's like we didn't add like a six more characters to the office every season, you know?
0:36:49.880000 - 0:36:50.880000::I want to.
0:36:50.880000 - 0:36:52.160000::That would have been amazing though.
0:36:52.160000 - 0:36:53.160000::That's a good idea.
0:36:53.160000 - 0:36:54.160000::It would have been incredible.
0:36:54.160000 - 0:36:57.800000::But season 10 would have been a fucking mind.
0:36:57.800000 - 0:36:58.800000::There have been too many people.
0:36:58.800000 - 0:37:02.160000::It would have been about Marlin.
0:37:02.160000 - 0:37:03.760000::It would have been about someone named Marlin.
0:37:03.760000 - 0:37:05.640000::And that's the main character's name and finding Nemo.
0:37:05.640000 - 0:37:07.120000::Nobody gives a shit.
0:37:07.120000 - 0:37:08.120000::Nemo.
0:37:08.120000 - 0:37:11.640000::Well, so here I have an idea.

0:37:13.960000 - 0:37:15.880000::See who can name the cutest Pokemon?
0:37:15.880000 - 0:37:18.960000::Of course, I was thinking of Gigglypuff too.
0:37:18.960000 - 0:37:19.960000::But that's the game.
0:37:19.960000 - 0:37:21.960000::No, you don't think see this one coming?
0:37:21.960000 - 0:37:24.640000::I was not saying Kirby, but that's not Kirby.
0:37:24.640000 - 0:37:26.560000::Fucking Pokemon.
0:37:26.560000 - 0:37:27.560000::That's cheating man.
0:37:27.560000 - 0:37:28.560000::That's cheating.
0:37:28.560000 - 0:37:30.560000::You can say just grab it.
0:37:30.560000 - 0:37:32.560000::Oh, it does grab it.

0:37:38.560000 - 0:37:39.560000::That's what I was going to say.
0:37:39.560000 - 0:37:40.560000::God damn it.
0:37:40.560000 - 0:37:41.560000::Get good luck.

0:37:52.560000 - 0:37:53.560000::I did it.
0:37:53.560000 - 0:37:54.560000::I didn't fully commit.
0:37:54.560000 - 0:37:55.560000::It's really hard to do.
0:37:55.560000 - 0:37:56.560000::The full Pikachu charging up, doing nothing.
0:37:56.560000 - 0:37:57.560000::Oh, God, here we go.
