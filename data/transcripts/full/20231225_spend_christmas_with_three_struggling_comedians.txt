0:00:18.640000 - 0:00:24.120000::So you wake up first thing in the morning, and something feels different.
0:00:24.120000 - 0:00:25.880000::Mm-hmm.
0:00:25.880000 - 0:00:31.920000::It feels almost as if your skin inside your veins is not regular red blood,
0:00:31.920000 - 0:00:35.280000::but it's gold and rivers of glitter and silver and red and green.
0:00:35.280000 - 0:00:36.280000::Red and green.
0:00:36.280000 - 0:00:37.280000::What's the reason?
0:00:37.280000 - 0:00:38.280000::Red and green about.
0:00:38.280000 - 0:00:39.280000::Walk down into the living room.
0:00:39.280000 - 0:00:40.680000::What do you see?
0:00:40.680000 - 0:00:42.280000::Who knows?
0:00:42.280000 - 0:00:43.280000::Mysteries.
0:00:43.280000 - 0:00:44.280000::You know what?
0:00:44.280000 - 0:00:45.280000::Mommy kissing Santa Claus.
0:00:45.280000 - 0:00:46.280000::Is it Daddy?
0:00:46.280000 - 0:00:47.280000::Looking around.
0:00:47.280000 - 0:00:50.280000::Is it Daddy getting all down on Santa Claus?
0:00:50.280000 - 0:00:51.280000::Mommy and Daddy.
0:00:51.280000 - 0:00:52.680000::Showing them his new tricks.
0:00:52.680000 - 0:00:56.680000::Santa reindeer playing video games.
0:00:56.680000 - 0:01:01.680000::Well, the possibilities of Christmas are just so endless.
0:01:01.680000 - 0:01:09.280000::And if you know, do you think there's anybody who sits like their head in the chimney,
0:01:09.280000 - 0:01:12.280000::just waiting for Santa to sit on there?
0:01:12.280000 - 0:01:17.080000::I stopped believing in Santa Claus a little too fucking late.
0:01:17.080000 - 0:01:18.080000::I'll just say that.
0:01:18.280000 - 0:01:26.080000::And I'll tell you why I was having my suspicions pretty early on, suspiciously early too,
0:01:26.080000 - 0:01:28.480000::in an advanced type of learning way where I was young.
0:01:28.480000 - 0:01:30.480000::I was like, I don't think this is real.
0:01:30.480000 - 0:01:36.480000::And then I pretty was pretty sure I had a reindeer on the fucking roof when I was about
0:01:36.480000 - 0:01:37.480000::nine.
0:01:37.480000 - 0:01:40.280000::And so that kept me believing a little bit too late.
0:01:40.280000 - 0:01:43.080000::Oh, I see what you're saying.
0:01:43.080000 - 0:01:49.520000::So I doubted and then I came back around pretty heavily.
0:01:49.520000 - 0:01:59.520000::I have basically zero memory of Santa Claus even being a thing that you could believe in.
0:01:59.520000 - 0:02:01.320000::That's a crisis of faith.
0:02:01.320000 - 0:02:03.800000::Well, well, yeah, it is.
0:02:03.800000 - 0:02:07.480000::I mean, I feel like when I was like, whatever, four or five years old, whenever I started
0:02:07.480000 - 0:02:15.800000::to understand and concepts that large, I would like, it was almost introduced as this
0:02:15.800000 - 0:02:18.680000::thing that people pretend about.
0:02:18.680000 - 0:02:19.680000::Right.
0:02:19.680000 - 0:02:25.520000::It was never, my parents were straight up ever since like they're like, Santa's not real.
0:02:25.520000 - 0:02:27.160000::Like this damn.
0:02:27.160000 - 0:02:28.160000::This is fucking fake.
0:02:28.160000 - 0:02:33.560000::And it was like a kid at school that was like, he knows Santa's not real, right?
0:02:33.560000 - 0:02:37.040000::Like I was that little piece of shit that was like Christmas for other kids.
0:02:37.040000 - 0:02:42.040000::But for your family, the reason for the season was the birth of Jesus, right?
0:02:42.040000 - 0:02:43.040000::Jesus Christ.
0:02:43.040000 - 0:02:49.840000::And we already talked about, if you haven't heard our fucking history of Christmas, then go
0:02:49.840000 - 0:02:53.120000::back a couple of episodes because we cover that in depth.
0:02:53.120000 - 0:02:57.880000::We are not going to talk about Christianity or any type of religious shit today because
0:02:57.880000 - 0:03:03.920000::today is just about Christmas and just about chilling out, celebrating what you have,
0:03:03.920000 - 0:03:08.520000::being thankful, not in the same way as on Thanksgiving, but in a different way, a more
0:03:08.520000 - 0:03:10.520000::Christmas type of way.
0:03:10.520000 - 0:03:11.520000::Golder.
0:03:11.520000 - 0:03:15.720000::What's the difference between the Christmas thankful and Thanksgiving thankful?
0:03:15.720000 - 0:03:18.720000::Well, let's see.
0:03:18.720000 - 0:03:21.920000::That's a good-ass question that I haven't thought about for a minute now.
0:03:21.920000 - 0:03:24.760000::One of them is grateful for food, the other one's grateful for gifts.
0:03:24.760000 - 0:03:25.760000::Present, not it.
0:03:25.760000 - 0:03:26.760000::That's it.
0:03:26.760000 - 0:03:29.240000::I like the food and I like stuff.
0:03:29.240000 - 0:03:30.240000::That pretty much sounds good.
0:03:30.240000 - 0:03:32.040000::Yeah, I think that pretty much does.
0:03:32.040000 - 0:03:34.360000::Makes the same simple way.
0:03:34.360000 - 0:03:35.680000::Question for you guys.
0:03:35.680000 - 0:03:36.680000::Question.
0:03:36.680000 - 0:03:39.880000::Do you guys, do you guys as families do stockings?
0:03:39.880000 - 0:03:40.880000::Yep.
0:03:40.880000 - 0:03:41.880000::Yeah.
0:03:41.880000 - 0:03:47.360000::Do you guys, because did you all have any rich friends growing up that had craziest fuck stockings?
0:03:47.360000 - 0:03:48.360000::Yes.
0:03:48.360000 - 0:03:49.360000::Because I'm a little old.
0:03:49.360000 - 0:03:53.240000::I'm a guy from a friend who got an iPod fucking nano in their stocking.
0:03:53.240000 - 0:03:54.240000::Damn.
0:03:54.240000 - 0:03:55.240000::Damn.
0:03:55.240000 - 0:03:56.240000::Yeah.
0:03:56.240000 - 0:04:00.960000::Some of you, some of you fucking rich people, you don't understand what a fucking stocking
0:04:00.960000 - 0:04:01.960000::is.
0:04:01.960000 - 0:04:04.080000::And iPod mini is not a fucking stocking gift.
0:04:04.080000 - 0:04:05.080000::You know what I'm talking about?
0:04:05.080000 - 0:04:06.080000::No, I'm not.
0:04:06.080000 - 0:04:07.080000::No, I'm not.
0:04:07.080000 - 0:04:08.080000::It's supposed to be an Apple.
0:04:08.080000 - 0:04:09.080000::An Apple.
0:04:09.080000 - 0:04:10.080000::Or a TickTax.
0:04:10.080000 - 0:04:12.560000::Yeah, it's bright, full of tick tacks.
0:04:12.560000 - 0:04:13.560000::An Apple.
0:04:13.560000 - 0:04:16.160000::Some fucking junk from the drug store.
0:04:16.160000 - 0:04:17.160000::Yeah.
0:04:17.160000 - 0:04:19.600000::It's supposed to be the worst part of your day is open.
0:04:19.600000 - 0:04:20.600000::Hand sanitizer.
0:04:20.600000 - 0:04:23::You're thinking that you're about to get something awesome and then you're like, oh, it's
0:04:23 - 0:04:24::fucking candy.
0:04:24 - 0:04:25::It's socks.
0:04:25 - 0:04:27.840000::I ain't nothing wrong with it.
0:04:27.840000 - 0:04:29.520000::Oh, that is a good point when you put it that way.
0:04:29.520000 - 0:04:34.520000::I wonder if anyone's ever gotten beaten to death with a stocking with a stocking.
0:04:34.520000 - 0:04:37.200000::No, yeah, back in the old days.
0:04:37.200000 - 0:04:38.200000::That was all you had.
0:04:38.200000 - 0:04:41.160000::When that's your only weapon was putting some fucking coal in a stocking.
0:04:41.160000 - 0:04:42.160000::Oh, God.
0:04:42.160000 - 0:04:44.360000::That's what the naughty kids would do back in the day.
0:04:44.360000 - 0:04:47.720000::Phil is talking with all of them beat their parents to death.
0:04:47.720000 - 0:04:55.920000::Something is, I bet you there's a lot of non-media covered violence and death that happens
0:04:55.920000 - 0:04:56.920000::on Christmas.
0:04:56.920000 - 0:04:59.480000::And it's kind of, it's the perfect data polized.
0:04:59.480000 - 0:05:00.040000::Everybody.

0:05:00 - 0:05:01.600000::I'm not sure if they're murderized.
0:05:01.600000 - 0:05:02.960000::The first thing I think from the museum,
0:05:02.960000 - 0:05:04.180000::I just want bodies.
0:05:05.600000 - 0:05:06.920000::Okay.
0:05:06.920000 - 0:05:08.060000::Different type of heist.
0:05:08.060000 - 0:05:08.900000::Oceans 11.
0:05:08.900000 - 0:05:10.060000::With no mustache like that,
0:05:10.060000 - 0:05:11.040000::it's hitting a little different
0:05:11.040000 - 0:05:13.200000::when you would be acting stuff the way.
0:05:13.200000 - 0:05:14.520000::I wasn't gonna address it.
0:05:14.520000 - 0:05:15.840000::If you're just listening,
0:05:16.840000 - 0:05:19.200000::you might wanna take a mother fucking look
0:05:19.200000 - 0:05:22.400000::because it looks like I got reconstructed surgically
0:05:22.400000 - 0:05:25.960000::into a more kind of pretty version of myself, I think.
0:05:25.960000 - 0:05:27.560000::Yeah, I don't feel natural,
0:05:27.560000 - 0:05:29.760000::I don't know who I am like this,
0:05:29.760000 - 0:05:31.360000::but you look like you're glowing.
0:05:31.360000 - 0:05:33.480000::Like you look like you de-age yourself.
0:05:33.480000 - 0:05:34.800000::You look like you're a relative
0:05:34.800000 - 0:05:36.920000::of Timothy Calamae right now.
0:05:36.920000 - 0:05:37.760000::Thanks for having me.
0:05:37.760000 - 0:05:39.880000::Looks like you just got some fresh blood platelets.
0:05:39.880000 - 0:05:41.800000::Fucking installed right in the face.
0:05:41.800000 - 0:05:45::I do feel like I'm 47 years old and I paid
0:05:45 - 0:05:47.680000::like the crazy amount of money in Mexico
0:05:47.680000 - 0:05:50.760000::to get some skin grafted shit type of shit redone.
0:05:50.760000 - 0:05:52.280000::It's crazy how my skin got better
0:05:52.280000 - 0:05:54.040000::when I got rid of the hair.
0:05:54.040000 - 0:05:57.520000::I mean, I still have, no, I've never had acne as an adult,
0:05:57.520000 - 0:05:59.680000::but I don't know.
0:05:59.680000 - 0:06:01.200000::200, just got one.
0:06:01.200000 - 0:06:02.040000::What is this?
0:06:02.040000 - 0:06:03.920000::I used to have acne bad when I was a teen.
0:06:03.920000 - 0:06:06.160000::That's not, I get it in one,
0:06:06.160000 - 0:06:08.680000::it's one single pimple on my fucking cheek.
0:06:10.360000 - 0:06:11.360000::And it disgusts people,
0:06:11.360000 - 0:06:13.400000::it makes them turn away from me and disgust.
0:06:15.160000 - 0:06:17.360000::Yeah, just face to the left, I guess.
0:06:19 - 0:06:19.960000::There you go.
0:06:19.960000 - 0:06:21.200000::Zoolanda, let's...
0:06:23.040000 - 0:06:24.040000::Zoolanda.
0:06:24.040000 - 0:06:25.920000::Help me remember what we were talking about
0:06:25.920000 - 0:06:27.040000::30 seconds ago.
0:06:27.680000 - 0:06:29.800000::Quite simply the joys of Christmas.
0:06:29.800000 - 0:06:30.640000::What are we getting?
0:06:30.640000 - 0:06:33.080000::Well, I wanted to check in with the patrons,
0:06:33.080000 - 0:06:35.680000::you're gonna do a one on one with them.
0:06:35.680000 - 0:06:36.520000::How are you guys?
0:06:36.520000 - 0:06:37.360000::I know they can't respond.
0:06:37.360000 - 0:06:39.760000::Are you listening to this on Christmas Day
0:06:39.760000 - 0:06:42.440000::while your family gathers and you hold secret resentments
0:06:42.440000 - 0:06:44.600000::for how they treated you as a kid?
0:06:44.600000 - 0:06:46.600000::Maybe this is the time you get to tell your dad,
0:06:46.600000 - 0:06:49.160000::I don't like how you yelled at me and how I used
0:06:49.160000 - 0:06:51.960000::to be scared when I hear your car pull in the driveway.
0:06:54.160000 - 0:06:55.640000::Maybe this is the time.
0:06:55.640000 - 0:06:57.560000::When the driveway was all gravel.
0:06:57.560000 - 0:06:59.320000::Right off of that statement Eric,
0:06:59.320000 - 0:07:02.080000::I think that there is no possible way.
0:07:02.080000 - 0:07:05::You're not going to heal any trauma during Christmas.
0:07:05 - 0:07:06.480000::This is not the time.
0:07:06.480000 - 0:07:10.640000::This is the time to bury it and just let time pass by.
0:07:10.640000 - 0:07:11.920000::Let the liquor flow.
0:07:11.920000 - 0:07:14.040000::Just let them just drink away the pain,
0:07:14.040000 - 0:07:16.080000::just get through this fucking week.
0:07:16.080000 - 0:07:19.400000::If you're trying to heal some sort of childhood trauma
0:07:19.400000 - 0:07:21.920000::with your parents of some sort or the way that you,
0:07:21.920000 - 0:07:23.600000::it's not gonna happen this week.
0:07:23.600000 - 0:07:25.520000::It's not gonna fucking happen.
0:07:25.520000 - 0:07:28.200000::You're gonna dive deeper into that pain
0:07:28.200000 - 0:07:31.440000::and all you need to do is just get through this fucking week.
0:07:31.440000 - 0:07:32.440000::All right.
0:07:32.440000 - 0:07:33.480000::And I'll tell you this,
0:07:33.480000 - 0:07:36.560000::if you have been eating a lot of holiday goodies,
0:07:36.560000 - 0:07:39.800000::which personally I haven't even attempted,
0:07:39.800000 - 0:07:42.240000::but if you have been and you're worried about,
0:07:42.240000 - 0:07:43.560000::you wanna lose a little weight
0:07:43.560000 - 0:07:46.320000::or you wanna get a little healthier in the new year,
0:07:46.320000 - 0:07:47.720000::just don't, I'll tell you what,
0:07:47.720000 - 0:07:49.880000::don't worry about it this week guys.
0:07:49.880000 - 0:07:52.920000::Okay, just fucking, I just had some butter cookies upstairs.
0:07:52.920000 - 0:07:55.720000::You know those cookies that come in the tins
0:07:55.720000 - 0:07:56.880000::that have the sugar on top
0:07:56.880000 - 0:07:59.800000::and they're roasted for being kind of flavorless cookies?
0:07:59.800000 - 0:08:01.120000::Well guess what?
0:08:01.120000 - 0:08:04.240000::I like those and I'm letting myself just,
0:08:04.240000 - 0:08:06.400000::if I want one, go get one.
0:08:06.400000 - 0:08:07.240000::Wow, that's great.
0:08:07.240000 - 0:08:08.080000::That's great.
0:08:08.080000 - 0:08:09.240000::Cheat week that I'm doing.
0:08:09.240000 - 0:08:10.080000::I'm doing this week.
0:08:10.080000 - 0:08:12.800000::Imagine you think that's cheating week.
0:08:12.800000 - 0:08:16.680000::Well, spoiler alert, I was at an awesome holiday function
0:08:16.680000 - 0:08:17.840000::last night.
0:08:17.840000 - 0:08:18.680000::Why don't you tell me,
0:08:18.680000 - 0:08:20.280000::why don't you text us about this last night?
0:08:20.280000 - 0:08:21.840000::Because dude, you were invited.
0:08:21.880000 - 0:08:23.040000::It's the hard trick.
0:08:23.040000 - 0:08:23.880000::That's the correct trick.
0:08:23.880000 - 0:08:26.320000::We can do things without having to check in with you
0:08:26.320000 - 0:08:27.480000::every second.
0:08:27.480000 - 0:08:29.440000::I'm fine doing things separate,
0:08:29.440000 - 0:08:31.360000::but I wanna know what you guys are up to.
0:08:31.360000 - 0:08:32.200000::You'll find out.
0:08:32.200000 - 0:08:34.600000::You'll find out when you see it in the fucking tabloids,
0:08:34.600000 - 0:08:35.920000::when you see me on the right carpet
0:08:35.920000 - 0:08:40.920000::of the local Virginia labor committee council holiday party.
0:08:42.200000 - 0:08:43.040000::Why was it that awkward?
0:08:43.040000 - 0:08:43.880000::What kind of record did they have?
0:08:43.880000 - 0:08:45.680000::Greek electricians, dude.
0:08:45.680000 - 0:08:49.800000::I don't know if you've ever heard of a little wine called
0:08:49.800000 - 0:08:51.920000::Littlefoot or something.
0:08:51.920000 - 0:08:52.760000::Oh, Barefoot.
0:08:52.760000 - 0:08:53.920000::Barefoot.
0:08:53.920000 - 0:08:54.760000::Yeah.
0:08:54.760000 - 0:08:55.920000::So Barefoot, why?
0:08:55.920000 - 0:08:59.560000::Three liters of that for about 50 or 70 people.
0:09:00.440000 - 0:09:01.280000::Yeah.
0:09:01.280000 - 0:09:04.480000::My uncle got my mom some yellow tail one Christmas
0:09:04.480000 - 0:09:07.720000::for her Christmas present and said it was imported.
0:09:07.720000 - 0:09:09.800000::And technically there was no lie told there.
0:09:09.800000 - 0:09:10.640000::He's correct.
0:09:11.600000 - 0:09:13.800000::That does come from Australia.
0:09:13.800000 - 0:09:16.280000::However, it's deceitful in a sense.
0:09:17.280000 - 0:09:21.280000::That is a pretty much guaranteed fucking hangover.
0:09:21.280000 - 0:09:26.280000::Oh, fucking a leader of yellow tail warm yellow tail.
0:09:26.280000 - 0:09:29.480000::While you watch while you watch monk with your mom.
0:09:29.480000 - 0:09:31.280000::Yeah, that's a fucking hangover.
0:09:31.280000 - 0:09:32.280000::Can you imagine?
0:09:32.280000 - 0:09:35.280000::Let me watch a real one for my mom.
0:09:35.280000 - 0:09:37.880000::Just walk five and walk around it.
0:09:37.880000 - 0:09:39.480000::Just watch the video.
0:09:39.480000 - 0:09:40.480000::Holy.
0:09:40.480000 - 0:09:45.480000::Get out of slip of monk some drugs and see who they can talk to.
0:09:46.280000 - 0:09:49.280000::So guess what food I've been eating?
0:09:49.280000 - 0:09:50.280000::What?
0:09:52.120000 - 0:09:55.920000::Awesome sandwiches because at this function I'm speaking of
0:09:55.920000 - 0:09:59.920000::was the big giant round plate of sandwiches.

0:10:00 - 0:10:01.340000::which is from the grocery store.
0:10:01.340000 - 0:10:02.180000::Mm.
0:10:02.180000 - 0:10:05.300000::Probably had about nine of those at the function.
0:10:05.300000 - 0:10:08.860000::Then I probably had about six of those before bed last night.
0:10:08.860000 - 0:10:10.420000::That's probably why I couldn't sleep.
0:10:10.420000 - 0:10:12.300000::And then, guess what?
0:10:13.320000 - 0:10:14.980000::Three more for breakfast.
0:10:14.980000 - 0:10:15.820000::Oh my.
0:10:15.820000 - 0:10:16.660000::Oh my.
0:10:16.660000 - 0:10:17.500000::Is it all meat?
0:10:17.500000 - 0:10:19.820000::Is it ham, turkey, and rose beef?
0:10:19.820000 - 0:10:20.980000::That's exactly correct.
0:10:20.980000 - 0:10:21.820000::And with different cheeses.
0:10:21.820000 - 0:10:22.820000::How did I know that?
0:10:22.820000 - 0:10:23.660000::American.
0:10:23.660000 - 0:10:24.980000::I don't know, but you knew.
0:10:24.980000 - 0:10:27.380000::Because I could, you know now that I think about it,
0:10:27.380000 - 0:10:29.740000::you did send a picture of the function last night.
0:10:29.740000 - 0:10:31.460000::So I already saw, I didn't know what you're up to.
0:10:31.460000 - 0:10:33.620000::So thanks for letting me know.
0:10:33.620000 - 0:10:34.460000::All right.
0:10:36.220000 - 0:10:38.020000::And you know what I watched last night?
0:10:38.020000 - 0:10:39.020000::What?

0:10:51.540000 - 0:10:52.380000::Willem Defeat.
0:10:52.380000 - 0:10:54.540000::No, Willem Defeat was not in that.
0:10:54.540000 - 0:10:55.740000::I just remember who we got.
0:10:55.740000 - 0:10:57.340000::We got Del Toro.
0:10:57.340000 - 0:10:59.580000::We got Spaniacio Del Toro.
0:11:00.140000 - 0:11:01.740000::Oh, Benicio is in that.

0:11:39.860000 - 0:11:42.860000::You need to look up some clips from that.
0:11:42.860000 - 0:11:46.820000::And like I swear to God, it was like he took an acting class
0:11:46.820000 - 0:11:48.100000::like from you.

0:12:17.740000 - 0:12:20.900000::Oh, that's kind of, I've probably seen that movie 15 times.
0:12:20.900000 - 0:12:24.020000::I think I've already espoused my love for that movie on here.
0:12:24.020000 - 0:12:27.340000::But they did that shit so right.
0:12:27.340000 - 0:12:30.380000::And it was on, we watched it on a DVD as well.
0:12:30.380000 - 0:12:32.220000::And there's something about it being on a DVD.
0:12:32.220000 - 0:12:34.860000::It just looked a little bit different than it would on streaming.
0:12:34.860000 - 0:12:38.220000::It might, maybe I'm wrong.
0:12:38.220000 - 0:12:40.220000::No, I do think that's true because of the blue.
0:12:40.220000 - 0:12:41.780000::But it is different.
0:12:41.780000 - 0:12:42.620000::It is different.
0:12:42.620000 - 0:12:47.020000::Like there is a quality and goes through some sort of, you know,
0:12:47.020000 - 0:12:52.180000::codec fucking shit to get to a streaming service to, you know, it's not the same.
0:12:52.180000 - 0:12:56.420000::We need to dedicate a whole damn hour to codecs and talk to you about.
0:12:56.500000 - 0:12:59.540000::Special joy tactics, three way comedy.
0:12:59.540000 - 0:13:00.540000::On codecs.

0:14:24.860000 - 0:14:26.860000::What did I say?
0:14:26.860000 - 0:14:27.860000::What?
0:14:27.860000 - 0:14:28.860000::What?
0:14:28.860000 - 0:14:30.860000::The Joy Tackling's Bambus.
0:14:30.860000 - 0:14:33.860000::Why did you say that?
0:14:33.860000 - 0:14:37.860000::Because I misheard something that you said.
0:14:37.860000 - 0:14:39.860000::I thought that's what you had said.
0:14:39.860000 - 0:14:40.860000::I'm not thinking about that.
0:14:40.860000 - 0:14:42.860000::You roll up to your crib in a box.
0:14:42.860000 - 0:14:43.860000::All the stuff is in the box.
0:14:43.860000 - 0:14:44.860000::That worked.
0:14:44.860000 - 0:14:46.860000::We get out of this up.
0:14:46.860000 - 0:14:49.860000::Hey, what's in your frame right now?
0:14:49.860000 - 0:14:51.860000::I'm not going to make it.
0:14:51.860000 - 0:14:52.860000::I'm not going to make it.
0:14:52.860000 - 0:14:53.860000::I'm not going to make it.
0:14:53.860000 - 0:14:54.860000::I'm not going to make it.
0:14:54.860000 - 0:14:55.860000::I'm not going to make it.
0:14:55.860000 - 0:14:56.860000::I'm not going to make it.
0:14:56.860000 - 0:14:57.860000::I'm not going to make it.
0:14:57.860000 - 0:14:58.860000::I'm not going to make it.
0:14:58.860000 - 0:14:59.860000::I'm not going to make it.
0:14:59.860000 - 0:15:00.860000::I'm not going to make it.
0:15:00.860000 - 0:15:01.860000::I'm not going to make it.
0:15:01.860000 - 0:15:02.860000::I'm not going to make it.
0:15:02.860000 - 0:15:03.860000::I'm not going to make it.
0:15:03.860000 - 0:15:04.860000::I'm not going to make it.
0:15:04.860000 - 0:15:05.860000::I'm not going to make it.
0:15:05.860000 - 0:15:06.860000::I'm not going to make it.
0:15:06.860000 - 0:15:07.860000::I'm not going to make it.
0:15:07.860000 - 0:15:08.860000::I'm not going to make it.
0:15:08.860000 - 0:15:09.860000::I'm not going to make it.
0:15:09.860000 - 0:15:10.860000::I'm not going to make it.
0:15:10.860000 - 0:15:11.860000::I'm not going to make it.
0:15:11.860000 - 0:15:12.860000::I'm not going to make it.

0:15:00 - 0:15:03.560000::has converted into the most busted fucking music studio.
0:15:03.560000 - 0:15:09.340000::And there's like hanging like curtain next to me that I
0:15:09.340000 - 0:15:10.340000::XL.
0:15:10.340000 - 0:15:13.240000::I don't really know what's going on in this room.
0:15:13.240000 - 0:15:17.040000::I wish I could show you guys do a little tour, but it's really.
0:15:17.040000 - 0:15:18.920000::Don't worry about it.
0:15:18.920000 - 0:15:20.420000::Really, really, really.
0:15:20.420000 - 0:15:22.480000::Don't worry about it.
0:15:22.480000 - 0:15:24.200000::Don't worry about that.
0:15:24.200000 - 0:15:28.520000::And I'm laying down in my mom's basement on the carpeted floor.
0:15:28.520000 - 0:15:31.920000::You know that type of nobody has carpet anymore.
0:15:31.920000 - 0:15:34.960000::I miss carpet in New York that I know it's all hardwood or
0:15:34.960000 - 0:15:37.480000::linoleum, whatever tile.
0:15:37.480000 - 0:15:40.080000::There's that feeling where you lay on carpet for so long that it
0:15:40.080000 - 0:15:42.120000::kind of irritates your elbows.
0:15:42.120000 - 0:15:43.120000::Remember that feeling?
0:15:43.120000 - 0:15:44.120000::Yes.
0:15:44.120000 - 0:15:47.320000::Oh, when you get the house watching fucking cartoon network.
0:15:47.320000 - 0:15:50.760000::Yeah, Eric, I think we're on the same carpet right now.
0:15:50.760000 - 0:15:51.760000::Is it all?
0:15:51.760000 - 0:15:52.760000::It would be so interesting.
0:15:52.760000 - 0:15:56.760000::It would be beautiful, isn't it?
0:15:56.760000 - 0:15:57.760000::I'm curious.
0:15:57.760000 - 0:15:58.760000::Isn't that interesting?
0:15:58.760000 - 0:16:01.960000::I was just watching an interview with the guy who shot some of
0:16:01.960000 - 0:16:02.960000::him in the head.
0:16:02.960000 - 0:16:04.360000::Oh, Chris something.
0:16:04.360000 - 0:16:05.360000::Chris Hemsworth.
0:16:05.360000 - 0:16:06.360000::I don't know.
0:16:06.360000 - 0:16:10.320000::Chris Hemsworth, though, Hemsworth brothers, if I can win in there.
0:16:10.320000 - 0:16:11.320000::There's two Hemsworths.
0:16:11.320000 - 0:16:12.320000::Did all the work go on?
0:16:12.320000 - 0:16:14.160000::There's multiple Hemsworths, dude.
0:16:14.160000 - 0:16:15.160000::Really?
0:16:15.160000 - 0:16:20.320000::Oh, there are some dynastic people like Reese Witherspoon or
0:16:20.320000 - 0:16:22.400000::whatever.
0:16:22.400000 - 0:16:26.440000::So anyways, this guy's talking about, and I hate to bring up war.
0:16:26.440000 - 0:16:30.160000::Ding, ding, ding, war, topic, a lot of dynastic buzzer.
0:16:30.160000 - 0:16:32.400000::But he basically went, it was talked about how he went, shot
0:16:32.400000 - 0:16:35.080000::somebody in the head while he was sleeping with his wife.
0:16:35.080000 - 0:16:37.200000::Not like fucking, but just sleeping in the bed.
0:16:37.200000 - 0:16:38.720000::They were asleep, you know.
0:16:38.720000 - 0:16:40.680000::And then he woke up.
0:16:40.680000 - 0:16:42.880000::He reached for those, he whatever.
0:16:42.880000 - 0:16:47.400000::And then he had no choice but to basically put his head on
0:16:47.400000 - 0:16:50::ice.
0:16:50 - 0:16:54.640000::And he said, you know what's crazy, man?
0:16:54.640000 - 0:16:56.280000::There's a world where we
0:16:56.280000 - 0:17:01.640000::could have met each other, some cafe in Paris, and had a nice
0:17:01.640000 - 0:17:03.520000::conversation.
0:17:03.520000 - 0:17:07.560000::Because our government sent us out here to kill each other.
0:17:07.560000 - 0:17:09.680000::This is how it went down.
0:17:09.680000 - 0:17:11.880000::Where was this Afghanistan?
0:17:14.880000 - 0:17:16.880000::Is the Afghanistan government sent out?
0:17:16.880000 - 0:17:18.240000::I don't think that.
0:17:18.240000 - 0:17:19.880000::What?
0:17:19.880000 - 0:17:21.400000::What?
0:17:21.400000 - 0:17:23.600000::Just war is hell.
0:17:23.600000 - 0:17:24.520000::We know this.
0:17:24.520000 - 0:17:25.200000::I mean, there's more.
0:17:25.200000 - 0:17:26.320000::What more can we say?
0:17:26.320000 - 0:17:28.720000::I was visiting with my uncle.
0:17:28.720000 - 0:17:31.120000::This is part of the thing that we cut out in the Patreon episode
0:17:31.120000 - 0:17:32.360000::because it was too sad.
0:17:32.360000 - 0:17:35.280000::But my uncle, great, uncle's not doing too well.
0:17:35.280000 - 0:17:38.440000::And I was looking at his bookshelf.
0:17:38.440000 - 0:17:42.400000::And he served in Vietnam, Korean war.
0:17:42.400000 - 0:17:49.360000::And his bookshelf is basically all war fiction and war history.
0:17:49.360000 - 0:17:53.520000::So he had a whole shelf on World War II fiction books.
0:17:53.520000 - 0:17:55::And he was like, do you want one of those?
0:17:55 - 0:17:56.640000::And I said, sure, I'll take one.
0:17:56.640000 - 0:17:57.480000::Pick that this one.
0:17:57.480000 - 0:17:59.240000::It's called Great Eagles.
0:17:59.240000 - 0:18:02.960000::It's about these retired Nazi pilots who have a bone to pick
0:18:02.960000 - 0:18:05.800000::with the American pilots that beat their asses in World War II.
0:18:05.800000 - 0:18:08.880000::And it's about a rematch 30 years later.
0:18:08.880000 - 0:18:09.920000::Sounds pretty cool, right?
0:18:09.920000 - 0:18:10.920000::A rematch.
0:18:10.920000 - 0:18:11.760000::What?
0:18:11.760000 - 0:18:14.400000::It's about a rematch in the air where the pilots fight each other.
0:18:14.400000 - 0:18:17.840000::But holding the book, it makes me look kind of Nazi-ish.
0:18:17.840000 - 0:18:19.720000::Because it looks like it's kind of pro.
0:18:19.720000 - 0:18:20.680000::It's called Great Eagles.
0:18:20.680000 - 0:18:23.280000::And it has a lot of Nazi insignias on it.
0:18:23.280000 - 0:18:26.280000::And I don't think I can read that shit in public.
0:18:29.280000 - 0:18:31.200000::Not in most areas, probably.
0:18:31.200000 - 0:18:32.040000::Right.
0:18:32.040000 - 0:18:35::But freedom of speech also.
0:18:35 - 0:18:36.800000::You should be able to read that in public.
0:18:36.800000 - 0:18:38.240000::True or false?
0:18:38.240000 - 0:18:41.600000::Nate has a secret of log on freedom of speech.
0:18:41.600000 - 0:18:43.560000::When you hold the mic out, you get black out
0:18:43.560000 - 0:18:45.600000::and then start just speaking your mind a little bit
0:18:45.600000 - 0:18:46.920000::on the moment.
0:18:46.920000 - 0:18:47.760000::I can imagine.
0:18:49.880000 - 0:18:52.360000::Since when did freedom of speech advocacy
0:18:52.360000 - 0:18:55.720000::become so twisted?
0:18:55.720000 - 0:19:03.520000::Anybody who's like, you think that in a perfect world,
0:19:03.520000 - 0:19:05.840000::people who are pro free speech, you
0:19:05.840000 - 0:19:11.360000::think they'd be pro democracy and see the good in that.
0:19:11.360000 - 0:19:14.160000::But people who love free speech now
0:19:14.160000 - 0:19:18.240000::are just the most racist, worst people on the planet.
0:19:18.240000 - 0:19:18.760000::Roman.
0:19:19.760000 - 0:19:23.040000::And I do know what you're talking about.
0:19:23.040000 - 0:19:25.360000::But did you ever think about this?
0:19:25.360000 - 0:19:28.840000::That you think I'm about to go into a joking point of view,
0:19:28.840000 - 0:19:30.360000::but maybe not.
0:19:30.360000 - 0:19:32.240000::I'm like, you are.
0:19:32.240000 - 0:19:34.840000::Maybe I'm not though.
0:19:34.840000 - 0:19:37.120000::Do you ever think maybe it didn't move at all
0:19:37.120000 - 0:19:41.360000::and the radical left is what moved into the area of fascism?
0:19:41.360000 - 0:19:44.240000::I hate to talk about politics and get all fucked up
0:19:44.240000 - 0:19:47.680000::like this on Christmas, but that's what Christmas is about, man.
0:19:47.680000 - 0:19:48.440000::It's Christmas.
0:19:48.440000 - 0:19:50.240000::We can't fucking go into this shit.
0:19:50.240000 - 0:19:51.600000::Nobody's to it, dude.
0:19:51.600000 - 0:19:53.880000::I want to come out right now.
0:19:53.880000 - 0:19:59.440000::I have been volunteering for CPAC for conservative political action
0:19:59.440000 - 0:20:00.920000::committees.

0:20:00 - 0:20:05.460000::For years and years, that's why I shaved my mustache and got this haircut because this is my last episode
0:20:05.460000 - 0:20:09.700000::I'm joining the band Trump at Boston University. We are dorming together
0:20:10.680000 - 0:20:12.680000::We're yeah

0:20:55.120000 - 0:20:59.960000::People were freestyling in Israel. Okay recently and it was a
0:21:00 - 0:21:02::circle of

0:21:10.360000 - 0:21:15.920000::They were freestyling in different language like having a cipher in different languages and they didn't know what each other
0:21:15.920000 - 0:21:20.040000::We're saying that's beautiful. It was making me laugh
0:21:23.160000 - 0:21:25.160000::That's like
0:21:26.160000 - 0:21:33.840000::I had a lot of roommates that were addicted to weed and shrooms and shit in college and that's maybe their dream of what heaven was like

0:23:43.320000 - 0:23:47.480000::Imagine this this is a date I've had the most fucking cringy daydreams of all time
0:23:49.480000 - 0:23:52.560000::Imagine this is what I when nobody was my friend
0:23:52.560000 - 0:23:55.920000::I know everybody doubted my skills when I was in high school
0:23:55.920000 - 0:24:00.760000::I imagine something like this you go with your friends who think you're just a normal loser that can't play sports
0:24:00.760000 - 0:24:03.120000::And I have no coordination and is gaining weight
0:24:04.120000 - 0:24:09.120000::And if you were like you pull up to the fucking some festival or something like one set guys
0:24:09.120000 - 0:24:12.480000::I gotta go do some then you bust out on stage doing French rap. Oh
0:24:14.200000 - 0:24:16.720000::Can you imagine what they would think of you then?
0:24:17.440000 - 0:24:23.360000::Yeah, that's a classic daydream man. I wouldn't be worried about that. That's pretty pathetic. That's a pretty
0:24:25.560000 - 0:24:27.560000::That's not
0:24:30.760000 - 0:24:32.760000::Yeah, that's so sad. I
0:24:34.760000 - 0:24:36.760000::I
0:24:37.320000 - 0:24:41::Who did oh I asked my prime you guys know how I asked my prom date to prom oh
0:24:41.640000 - 0:24:43.960000::No, this is maybe the most pathetic
0:24:47.160000 - 0:24:53.640000::Remember remember them free hug signs. This is bad. Oh free hugs. I
0:24:54.800000 - 0:24:56.800000::Made a free prom date sign
0:24:56.800000 - 0:24:58.800000::and
0:24:58.800000 - 0:25:00.800000::stood next to

0:25:00 - 0:25:05.320000::There was a free, there was a free-hose guy standing in the park and I was standing next
0:25:05.320000 - 0:25:07.160000::to him with a free prom date.
0:25:07.160000 - 0:25:08.160000::Damn.
0:25:08.160000 - 0:25:12.400000::No, that's actually, I feel like that's hard to be right next to him.
0:25:12.400000 - 0:25:14.240000::I thought it was funny.
0:25:14.240000 - 0:25:19.040000::Did somebody else, you know what I'm saying, what if somebody else had came up to you?
0:25:19.040000 - 0:25:22.560000::I would say, well, depends, are they a model?
0:25:22.560000 - 0:25:29.920000::Are they a model but it's for Saudi Arabia magazine that you have to ethically consider.
0:25:29.920000 - 0:25:34.400000::Is it a model for Saudi Arabia magazine?
0:25:34.400000 - 0:25:36.640000::Then yeah, that's going down for sure.
0:25:36.640000 - 0:25:38.480000::Just scratched my nose on the mic.
0:25:38.480000 - 0:25:39.480000::Nice.
0:25:39.480000 - 0:25:47.960000::Well, you guys heard about this but I think the listeners deserve to know that I almost
0:25:47.960000 - 0:25:50.400000::died a couple days ago.
0:25:50.400000 - 0:25:51.800000::How did we not start with this, dude?
0:25:51.800000 - 0:25:53.800000::You guys are on us.
0:25:53.800000 - 0:25:56.360000::I mean, I just, you guys have already heard it.
0:25:57.200000 - 0:26:02.360000::But I feel like the listeners deserve to know that joy tax could have been at two thirds
0:26:02.360000 - 0:26:07.320000::podcasts a couple days ago because I came within an inch of dying.
0:26:07.320000 - 0:26:10.400000::I got into a car wreck the other day.
0:26:10.400000 - 0:26:17.280000::My dad's brand new 2024 Hyundai Tucson, which just drives me around in that fucking
0:26:17.280000 - 0:26:23.920000::bitch, rolling around in German village in Columbus and who fucking comes out of an alleyway
0:26:23.920000 - 0:26:27.480000::and T-bones my fucking ass.
0:26:27.480000 - 0:26:31.160000::You got smacked by a college fucking student.
0:26:31.160000 - 0:26:34.320000::Oh, supposedly the smartest people in our society, right?
0:26:34.320000 - 0:26:35.320000::Sure.
0:26:35.320000 - 0:26:40.120000::Where they did a little different type of smoke come out of their window when they opened
0:26:40.120000 - 0:26:42.120000::the door.
0:26:42.120000 - 0:26:43.120000::Green smoke.
0:26:43.120000 - 0:26:44.120000::Yeah.
0:26:44.120000 - 0:26:45.120000::Don't worry.
0:26:45.120000 - 0:26:49.760000::I did a four-brethalization and you put them in a sands arrest immediately.
0:26:49.760000 - 0:26:51.320000::You put them in a full Nelson.
0:26:51.320000 - 0:26:53.120000::Let me put you in a full Nelson.
0:26:53.120000 - 0:26:55::Wait, so play by play.
0:26:55 - 0:26:58::You are driving along listening to what Nick.
0:26:58 - 0:27:01.040000::I think I was Christmas music if I wasn't.
0:27:01.040000 - 0:27:02.040000::Oh, great.
0:27:02.040000 - 0:27:06.480000::Like I was putting on Dean Martin's Christmas album.
0:27:06.480000 - 0:27:08.840000::Just listen to some classics, you know, radical.
0:27:08.840000 - 0:27:10.440000::The ethical crooner.
0:27:10.440000 - 0:27:11.440000::That was an ethical man.
0:27:11.440000 - 0:27:13.360000::You say the driving crooner?
0:27:13.360000 - 0:27:14.680000::The ethical crooner.
0:27:14.680000 - 0:27:15.680000::Oh.
0:27:15.680000 - 0:27:18.600000::Okay, so you're driving along, bumping.
0:27:18.600000 - 0:27:19.920000::Mine in my own fucking business.
0:27:19.920000 - 0:27:24.920000::I'm bricked up to Dean Martin.
0:27:24.920000 - 0:27:26.920000::And then we go.
0:27:26.920000 - 0:27:32.840000::I'm driving in some of these coming out of an alleyway and just fucking barrels into the passenger
0:27:32.840000 - 0:27:34.240000::side of the car.
0:27:34.240000 - 0:27:35.240000::What?
0:27:35.240000 - 0:27:37.240000::Coming out of an alleyway.
0:27:37.240000 - 0:27:39.440000::And did you see them?
0:27:39.440000 - 0:27:41.400000::No, they didn't see me.
0:27:41.400000 - 0:27:43.240000::I'm not the person that was supposed to look out for this.
0:27:43.240000 - 0:27:45.720000::No, I know, but you didn't see their car coming.
0:27:45.720000 - 0:27:49.840000::Did you stiff up your body or did you, were you totally taken by surprise?
0:27:49.840000 - 0:27:51.480000::And were you loose like a rag doll?
0:27:51.480000 - 0:27:52.480000::You know what?
0:27:52.480000 - 0:27:59.080000::As it happened, I kind of felt like a weird like time slowed down and I felt like a piece.
0:27:59.080000 - 0:28:04.240000::Because I was like, okay, I'm not like physically getting like fucked up right now.
0:28:04.240000 - 0:28:07.880000::And it just felt like it felt like a bumper car kind of scenario.
0:28:07.880000 - 0:28:13.640000::Because we were going like slow enough where it wasn't like too jarring, you know?
0:28:13.640000 - 0:28:20.360000::It felt like a kind of an upgraded bumper car type scenario.
0:28:20.360000 - 0:28:24.760000::Okay, so they smacked the fuck out of the Tucson.
0:28:24.760000 - 0:28:26.560000::Did the airbag go off?
0:28:26.560000 - 0:28:28.200000::No, the airbag did not go off.
0:28:28.200000 - 0:28:29.440000::That's on you Hyundai.
0:28:29.440000 - 0:28:30.440000::That's on you Hyundai.
0:28:30.440000 - 0:28:31.440000::That's interesting.
0:28:31.440000 - 0:28:32.440000::That's interesting.
0:28:32.440000 - 0:28:33.440000::Interesting.
0:28:33.440000 - 0:28:34.440000::Not cool.
0:28:34.440000 - 0:28:39.120000::And so you were saying to us that you are the best person to possibly get into a car accident
0:28:39.120000 - 0:28:42.280000::because most people, when you get hit, you come out of the car.
0:28:42.280000 - 0:28:44.520000::Even if it was at 0.5 miles an hour.
0:28:44.520000 - 0:28:47.800000::Ah, ah, ah, you shattered my vertebrae.
0:28:47.800000 - 0:28:49.880000::It's going to cost me $300,000 in medical.
0:28:49.880000 - 0:28:51.200000::You got to fucking pay me right now.
0:28:51.200000 - 0:28:52.200000::I'll kill you.
0:28:52.200000 - 0:28:54.400000::So you come out of the car, blood leaking from your head.
0:28:54.400000 - 0:28:55.400000::With the first aid kit, right?
0:28:55.400000 - 0:28:56.400000::I'm good, bro.
0:28:56.400000 - 0:28:57.400000::I'm good.
0:28:57.400000 - 0:28:58.400000::I'm good.
0:28:58.400000 - 0:28:59.400000::I'm good.
0:28:59.400000 - 0:29:00.400000::I'm good.
0:29:00.400000 - 0:29:01.400000::I'm good.
0:29:01.400000 - 0:29:02.400000::I'm good.
0:29:02.400000 - 0:29:03.400000::I'm good.
0:29:03.400000 - 0:29:04.400000::I come out and I say, are you okay?
0:29:04.400000 - 0:29:05.400000::I'm worried about them.
0:29:05.400000 - 0:29:06.400000::You said, are you okay?
0:29:06.400000 - 0:29:07.400000::Are you all right?
0:29:07.400000 - 0:29:08.400000::And then I said, you know what?
0:29:08.400000 - 0:29:09.400000::This is my dad's car.
0:29:09.400000 - 0:29:11.480000::I'm going to call him and then we're just going to get the insurance.
0:29:11.480000 - 0:29:16.080000::Maybe who, some fucking, what would you guys have done?
0:29:16.080000 - 0:29:19.720000::You guys would have been, you fucking dumb son of a bitch.
0:29:19.720000 - 0:29:24.440000::Here's what I, when I go into a new city and I rent a car, first stop I make is at the
0:29:24.440000 - 0:29:26.920000::sporting goods store, the big five, whatever.
0:29:26.920000 - 0:29:33.320000::I buy a fucking, fucking the hardest aluminum, crazy ass, Louisville slugger.
0:29:33.320000 - 0:29:35.120000::I wrap that thing in a sock.
0:29:35.120000 - 0:29:36.520000::You know why I do that?
0:29:36.520000 - 0:29:40.600000::If you put a sock, here's a life saving piece of advice.
0:29:40.600000 - 0:29:46.020000::If you want to be away someone with a bat, put a sock on that shit first because guess
0:29:46.020000 - 0:29:50.480000::what the sock means to hits because that first hit, they're going to grab the bat and they're
0:29:50.480000 - 0:29:54.120000::going to try to take it away from you but they'll just pull the sock off.
0:29:54.120000 - 0:29:55.120000::Right.
0:29:55.120000 - 0:29:56.120000::Okay.
0:29:56.120000 - 0:29:59.920000::Wait, have you, is this an original like?

0:30:00 - 0:30:05::No, no, I've seen this online somewhere.
0:30:06.640000 - 0:30:09.200000::But yeah, I put that shit in the back of my car,
0:30:09.200000 - 0:30:11.880000::usually if I can premium SUV.
0:30:11.880000 - 0:30:15.040000::And then I take it out and I ask them if they're okay,
0:30:15.040000 - 0:30:17.560000::but I want to protect myself if needed.
0:30:17.560000 - 0:30:18.640000::Right.
0:30:18.640000 - 0:30:22.320000::Well, here's where our plans differ a little bit
0:30:22.320000 - 0:30:26.640000::because if somebody hits me, oh, now you fucked up.
0:30:26.640000 - 0:30:29.920000::And do you know what the biggest baseball bat in the world is?
0:30:29.920000 - 0:30:32.560000::It's a Luminum-Fucking baseball bat.
0:30:32.560000 - 0:30:35.680000::Yeah, called the RAV4 or whatever I'm in at the time.
0:30:36.840000 - 0:30:38.240000::And I go like this.
0:30:39.320000 - 0:30:41.640000::That is totally understandable,
0:30:41.640000 - 0:30:43.280000::the accident that just happened.
0:30:43.280000 - 0:30:45::I'm so patient with you.
0:30:45 - 0:30:46.760000::Why don't we pull over to the side of the road
0:30:46.760000 - 0:30:47.880000::so that we can just have a quick,
0:30:47.880000 - 0:30:50.640000::why don't we just want to click word with you?
0:30:50.640000 - 0:30:53.400000::I back up, I put it in neutral.
0:30:55.960000 - 0:30:58.520000::Switching to drive, yeah!
0:30:58.560000 - 0:31:00.840000::And then I fucking dive,
0:31:00.840000 - 0:31:03.960000::let the car ghost ride it, floor it, put a brick on the thing.
0:31:03.960000 - 0:31:05.560000::I get up on top of the roof of the car,
0:31:05.560000 - 0:31:08.680000::I smack him with the car, and then I jump off it,
0:31:08.680000 - 0:31:09.520000::stunt guys off.
0:31:09.520000 - 0:31:11.200000::With two katanas in your hands,
0:31:11.200000 - 0:31:13.080000::you slice them off the top off there.
0:31:13.080000 - 0:31:16.560000::Yeah, and I fucking get my sharp ass K-92.
0:31:18.480000 - 0:31:20.440000::Damn, you two got a sharp one.
0:31:20.440000 - 0:31:22.640000::And I put that right in his fucking nose.
0:31:24.240000 - 0:31:25.760000::By his fucking nose off, spit it out of the camera.
0:31:25.760000 - 0:31:29.680000::You know that on the old timey ships, right?
0:31:29.680000 - 0:31:31.880000::The old timey ships.
0:31:31.880000 - 0:31:33.200000::Like the pirate era.
0:31:33.200000 - 0:31:34.440000::Yeah.
0:31:34.440000 - 0:31:36.680000::No, no, before any type of steam engine,
0:31:36.680000 - 0:31:37.520000::the master's.
0:31:37.520000 - 0:31:38.120000::No as arc.
0:31:39 - 0:31:42.760000::Little after, okay, the 1700 ships are in the Navy back then.
0:31:44.280000 - 0:31:45.200000::When they wrapped you up,
0:31:45.200000 - 0:31:48.200000::because you would be buried at sea in your own hammock.
0:31:48.200000 - 0:31:50.800000::Okay, that's the body bag is the shit you sleep in.
0:31:50.800000 - 0:31:53.400000::That's how real death was back then.
0:31:53.400000 - 0:31:57.280000::But they would so you up with probably a fishing fucking hook.
0:31:57.280000 - 0:31:59.640000::And then the last so,
0:31:59.640000 - 0:32:02.520000::they would put it through your nose to make sure you weren't dead.
0:32:03.520000 - 0:32:04.920000::We weren't.
0:32:04.920000 - 0:32:08.720000::To make sure you weren't dead, because if you, wait.
0:32:09.920000 - 0:32:11.200000::So make sure that you weren't.
0:32:11.200000 - 0:32:12.040000::We're good.
0:32:12.040000 - 0:32:16.680000::Because if you weren't,
0:32:16.680000 - 0:32:18.720000::then you would be a yelp of tolerance.
0:32:18.720000 - 0:32:21::And then you just put a fucking hook to my nose.
0:32:21 - 0:32:22.440000::So explain this one more time.
0:32:22.440000 - 0:32:25.400000::They would put a fish hook through your nose to see if you were alive.
0:32:25.400000 - 0:32:26.640000::They so you're,
0:32:26.640000 - 0:32:30.800000::I'm learning this from this book I'm reading right now called The Wager.
0:32:30.800000 - 0:32:32.200000::It's the new David Graham.
0:32:32.200000 - 0:32:33.920000::I just saw that in Barnes and Noble's book.
0:32:33.920000 - 0:32:35.320000::It's popping off right now.
0:32:35.320000 - 0:32:36.800000::People are losing their minds.
0:32:36.800000 - 0:32:38.640000::The reviews are on the charts.
0:32:38.640000 - 0:32:39.680000::I love reviews.
0:32:39.680000 - 0:32:43.280000::But no, if you died at sea and you were on one of these ships,
0:32:43.280000 - 0:32:46.560000::they'd, they'd sew you up in your hammock.
0:32:46.560000 - 0:32:51.840000::The last stitch would go through your nose to make sure that you were dead.
0:32:51.840000 - 0:32:54.880000::Because you'd wake up if it was like from the immense amount of pain.
0:32:54.880000 - 0:32:55.800000::That's right.
0:32:55.800000 - 0:32:57.560000::And in case you wake up in the sea,
0:32:57.560000 - 0:32:59.760000::then they can reel you in because you're attached to it.
0:32:59.760000 - 0:33:00.760000::That's right.
0:33:00.760000 - 0:33:02.160000::That's great.
0:33:02.160000 - 0:33:03.480000::Interesting.
0:33:03.480000 - 0:33:05.680000::And do you know what I watch recently?
0:33:05.680000 - 0:33:06.880000::What?
0:33:06.880000 - 0:33:08.720000::Napoleon in theaters.
0:33:08.720000 - 0:33:10.760000::No, you watched the whole thing.
0:33:10.760000 - 0:33:11.760000::Mm-hmm.
0:33:11.760000 - 0:33:12.600000::And it was a good.
0:33:12.600000 - 0:33:16.600000::Just reminded me of the type of death at the,
0:33:16.600000 - 0:33:17.560000::at like the end,
0:33:17.560000 - 0:33:21.560000::it said how many people died from all of like the battles that Napoleon
0:33:21.600000 - 0:33:26.080000::had there was, you're not going to believe this man.
0:33:26.080000 - 0:33:27.080000::How much?
0:33:27.080000 - 0:33:30.280000::I think it said, when it was all said and done,
0:33:30.280000 - 0:33:34::three million died in his battle.
0:33:34 - 0:33:35.960000::In the name of Napoleon.
0:33:35.960000 - 0:33:38.880000::And Napoleon was just leading the, he was just playing,
0:33:38.880000 - 0:33:41.960000::like it was literally like playing chess, you know,
0:33:41.960000 - 0:33:45.560000::he just put out like, all right, let's put a thousand people up front.
0:33:45.560000 - 0:33:48.480000::If they get out, you know, it's like, we'll sacrifice things.
0:33:48.480000 - 0:33:49.480000::Right.
0:33:49.840000 - 0:33:52.960000::So people can, you know, the horses can come in.
0:33:52.960000 - 0:33:55.040000::And yeah, they just keep it.
0:33:55.040000 - 0:33:56.040000::They can keep it.
0:33:56.040000 - 0:33:58.240000::And compensating for something a little small.
0:33:58.240000 - 0:33:59.760000::Mm-hmm.
0:33:59.760000 - 0:34:02.080000::Napoleonically, you know what I mean?
0:34:02.080000 - 0:34:03.680000::They show him tapas.
0:34:03.680000 - 0:34:06.680000::Fucking rabid fucking in that movie.
0:34:06.680000 - 0:34:11.520000::He's like, like fucking, like the way they fucked back then.
0:34:11.520000 - 0:34:13.160000::I don't know if this is historically accurate,
0:34:13.160000 - 0:34:16.080000::but I believe that this is the way people were fucking back then.
0:34:16.080000 - 0:34:17.360000::How were they doing it?
0:34:17.400000 - 0:34:21.760000::He was just like, like, is the human vibe really quick?
0:34:21.760000 - 0:34:22.920000::Nate, that's how you do it.
0:34:22.920000 - 0:34:24.120000::You stiff your whole body.
0:34:24.120000 - 0:34:26.360000::Just damn.
0:34:26.360000 - 0:34:31.120000::Because could you, you're not going to let nobody was last in back then.
0:34:31.120000 - 0:34:33.800000::Well, there was no fucking dance average to ask questions to,
0:34:33.800000 - 0:34:34.480000::you know, back then.
0:34:34.480000 - 0:34:36.360000::So you were fucking clueless.
0:34:36.360000 - 0:34:37.920000::No, your boys didn't talk about it.
0:34:37.920000 - 0:34:38.720000::It was all private.
0:34:38.720000 - 0:34:43.160000::So you're just guessing not to stand up for him.
0:34:43.160000 - 0:34:44.680000::Evil, evil bastard.
0:34:44.680000 - 0:34:47.600000::You feel bad for all the females back then, man.
0:34:47.600000 - 0:34:48.600000::Good lord.
0:34:48.600000 - 0:34:49.600000::Nobody will be able to do that.
0:34:49.600000 - 0:34:52::I feel bad for so many females just all over the world.
0:34:52 - 0:34:53.560000::I know what you do, especially these days,
0:34:53.560000 - 0:34:54.800000::they need people like you.

0:35:00 - 0:35:07::Christmas day, Christmas day, come so near.
0:35:07 - 0:35:13::Are you guys gonna be eating regular ass food?
0:35:13 - 0:35:17::Or are you gonna have some special type of Christmas meal?
0:35:17 - 0:35:21::That's an amazing question.
0:35:21 - 0:35:23::I'm having this on ya. I'll just say it.
0:35:23 - 0:35:26::I'm gonna have to have it with meat in it or with vegetables in it.
0:35:26 - 0:35:28::Probably some fucking prom rib.
0:35:28 - 0:35:30::I'll stock it stuck in there.
0:35:30 - 0:35:33::That's not real, is it?
0:35:33 - 0:35:35::I'm pretty fucking gross.
0:35:35 - 0:35:37::I'll have been a lasagna.
0:35:37 - 0:35:41::You literally read me and then a lasagna.
0:35:41 - 0:35:43::Catch up on steak.
0:35:43 - 0:35:45::God, that makes me want to just...
0:35:45 - 0:35:49::What are you guys eating too fucking night?
0:35:49 - 0:35:50::I think I'm gonna...
0:35:50 - 0:35:55::I told you I'm going to a Festivist party,
0:35:55 - 0:35:58::just based on a Seinfeld episode.
0:35:58 - 0:36:03::It's crazy that people are still rocking with the fucking Seinfeld theme parties.
0:36:03 - 0:36:08::I guess that's the only type of Seinfeld party I know of, but...
0:36:08 - 0:36:09::A Festivist reference.
0:36:09 - 0:36:11::I'm going to the Festivist party.
0:36:11 - 0:36:15::My Nana had never seen Seinfeld move in watching it for the past few days,
0:36:15 - 0:36:18::and she's been fucking dying, lacking her.
0:36:18 - 0:36:20::Oh, that's great.
0:36:20 - 0:36:22::That's a good idea.
0:36:22 - 0:36:24::Save a bunch of stuff for later in life.
0:36:24 - 0:36:26::That's why I'm not watching all of a sunny yet,
0:36:26 - 0:36:29::because when I'm fucking 90 and fucking 90 as we've gone,
0:36:29 - 0:36:31::and I hooked up to 40 IVs.
0:36:31 - 0:36:32::Oh, dude.
0:36:32 - 0:36:34::When I'm fucking...
0:36:34 - 0:36:37::Tiger King, the Michael Jordan documentary.
0:36:37 - 0:36:40::I'm skipping the documentary.
0:36:40 - 0:36:43::I'm just going straight for the Kate McKinney joint.
0:36:43 - 0:36:45::Oh.
0:36:45 - 0:36:47::Well, in the future, you're gonna be...
0:36:47 - 0:36:49::Because movies are good.
0:36:49 - 0:36:51::Yo, I think I just got the best idea in the world.
0:36:51 - 0:36:55::Don't watch any TV shows or movies for the next 40 years.
0:36:55 - 0:36:56::Stop now.
0:36:56 - 0:37:00::Because eventually, they're all going to be re-released in a futuristic version of movies
0:37:00 - 0:37:02::where you can go into them and experience them like,
0:37:02 - 0:37:04::look at Morphean drip,
0:37:04 - 0:37:06::and you're going to wish you had seen that.
0:37:06 - 0:37:07::Wow, such a good point.
0:37:07 - 0:37:08::Such a good fucking point.
0:37:08 - 0:37:09::Don't eat any food.
0:37:09 - 0:37:11::Man, just wait.
0:37:11 - 0:37:12::Just wait.
0:37:12 - 0:37:13::It's coming.
0:37:13 - 0:37:14::Don't get that much of fucking...
0:37:14 - 0:37:17::Nate, you're going to go right into bring it on.
0:37:17 - 0:37:19::Dude.
0:37:20 - 0:37:23::Like, literally, that's crazy that you just said that.
0:37:23 - 0:37:26::Nate, is that the cheerleading movie?
0:37:26 - 0:37:27::Yeah.
0:37:27 - 0:37:29::I'm just standing like...
0:37:29 - 0:37:32::You just want to go watch the Amazing Chews.
0:37:32 - 0:37:35::I'm going into the bear.
0:37:35 - 0:37:37::Oh, well...
0:37:37 - 0:37:39::To buy me a slice.
0:37:39 - 0:37:41::You're going into the bear cheater tonight?
0:37:41 - 0:37:43::Wait, so Nate, tonight at the festival party,
0:37:43 - 0:37:44::what are you fucking...
0:37:44 - 0:37:45::What are you bringing into this?
0:37:45 - 0:37:47::What's the etiquette to go to your friend's party?
0:37:47 - 0:37:50::You coming through with the six pack,
0:37:50 - 0:37:52::some Pimento cheese, some wheat things.
0:37:52 - 0:37:53::What are you bringing?
0:37:53 - 0:37:54::You know what?
0:37:54 - 0:37:57::If I can be honest, I'm not going to bring a damn thing,
0:37:57 - 0:38:00::but I might go pick up some alcohol or something.
0:38:00 - 0:38:01::Yeah, just bring it all up.
0:38:01 - 0:38:06::It's a party where there's a lot of finger food kind of stuff.
0:38:06 - 0:38:08::Like, some...
0:38:08 - 0:38:10::It's just one of those things where it's like,
0:38:10 - 0:38:13::there's going to be too much alcohol already, you know what I'm saying?
0:38:13 - 0:38:14::Yeah.
0:38:14 - 0:38:15::So, but get high and you're going to be...
0:38:15 - 0:38:16::I'm not going to bring...
0:38:16 - 0:38:17::You're going to be...
0:38:17 - 0:38:18::I'm not going to bring...
0:38:18 - 0:38:19::You know what I'm saying?
0:38:19 - 0:38:20::I'm saying, you know what it's quality.
0:38:20 - 0:38:21::Right.
0:38:21 - 0:38:22::So, go get that, Shredka.
0:38:22 - 0:38:24::I should get a fucking Christmas ale.
0:38:24 - 0:38:27::Them high, them, fucking 12 ABV beers,
0:38:27 - 0:38:30::where it's 17 beers in one beer.
0:38:30 - 0:38:33::Oh, you know what I'm saying?
0:38:33 - 0:38:35::You know when you're allowed to drink them,
0:38:35 - 0:38:36::that shit.
0:38:36 - 0:38:39::I'm so done with IPAs, I'm so past that I'm like,
0:38:39 - 0:38:42::so much more mature and I only drink vloggers.
0:38:42 - 0:38:43::Blue collar style.
0:38:43 - 0:38:44::Right.
0:38:44 - 0:38:47::But after you get back from my hike,
0:38:47 - 0:38:50::we took my dad's girlfriend's dog out yesterday
0:38:50 - 0:38:54::to this amazing outdoor park called Mary More Park.
0:38:54 - 0:38:56::And then we hit the dam brewery.
0:38:56 - 0:38:57::People have just like,
0:38:57 - 0:38:58::you know, walk in IPAs.
0:38:58 - 0:38:59::People have just like, you know, walk in IPAs.
0:38:59 - 0:39:00::Yeah.
0:39:00 - 0:39:01::It disposations pretty right.
0:39:01 - 0:39:02::You know what I'm saying?
0:39:02 - 0:39:04::Because of the hop.
0:39:04 - 0:39:07::Because, are you guys glad I told that to you guys?
0:39:07 - 0:39:08::Extreme.
0:39:08 - 0:39:09::Yes.
0:39:09 - 0:39:11::That's not Christmas gratitude that we're talking about.
0:39:11 - 0:39:12::If you're listening to this,
0:39:12 - 0:39:15::if you're podcast listener and you like that story,
0:39:15 - 0:39:17::sound off, let me know what you thought about that.
0:39:17 - 0:39:18::I told that for you guys.
0:39:18 - 0:39:19::I know you're curious.
0:39:19 - 0:39:20::Yeah.
0:39:20 - 0:39:22::If you're not a podcast listener,
0:39:22 - 0:39:26::that's odd.
0:39:26 - 0:39:28::Yeah.
0:39:28 - 0:39:29::Nate, can I say something?
0:39:29 - 0:39:31::And you're not allowed to get mad about it?
0:39:31 - 0:39:32::Please.
0:39:32 - 0:39:35::Tell your head down a little bit.
0:39:35 - 0:39:36::Like literally two degrees.
0:39:36 - 0:39:37::Stop.
0:39:37 - 0:39:38::Stop.
0:39:38 - 0:39:40::For some reason,
0:39:40 - 0:39:45::this is the most a head has ever looked to me like a balloon.
0:39:45 - 0:39:46::Oh, yeah.
0:39:46 - 0:39:49::Because it got that classic shine on it.
0:39:49 - 0:39:51::Like I could literally see,
0:39:51 - 0:39:53::I can literally blur my eyes right now
0:39:53 - 0:39:56::and imagine just carrying your head around on a string.
0:39:56 - 0:39:58::Not like that.
0:39:58 - 0:40:00::Not in a like a murderer way, but

0:40:00 - 0:40:03::and balloons make people happy by the way.
0:40:03 - 0:40:05.720000::So there must be something subconscious to that,
0:40:05.720000 - 0:40:07.680000::where little kids or anybody really
0:40:07.680000 - 0:40:08.520000::was a good save.
0:40:08.520000 - 0:40:09.520000::Everyone's balloons.
0:40:10.720000 - 0:40:13.320000::No, it's not fucking off-putting.
0:40:15.200000 - 0:40:16.200000::Shout out to that.
0:40:16.200000 - 0:40:18.080000::Eric, what's your head look like right now,
0:40:18.080000 - 0:40:19.680000::inanimately?
0:40:19.680000 - 0:40:20.520000::Careful.
0:40:21.760000 - 0:40:22.600000::Maybe like a...
0:40:22.600000 - 0:40:24.560000::What if I got my lips all plumped?
0:40:25.560000 - 0:40:27.840000::Oh, you couldn't plump them anymore, man.
0:40:27.840000 - 0:40:28.680000::I know, there's so many.
0:40:28.680000 - 0:40:30.400000::Yeah, at least get them glossy.
0:40:30.400000 - 0:40:34.600000::Sometimes if it's just glossy, you know what I'm saying?
0:40:34.600000 - 0:40:36.040000::It kinda lifts a little more plump.
0:40:36.040000 - 0:40:38.680000::I've been hitting that chapety stick.
0:40:38.680000 - 0:40:42::How come we gotta start talking more maturely?
0:40:42 - 0:40:43.160000::Okay.
0:40:43.160000 - 0:40:45.320000::How come the bottom lip?
0:40:46.600000 - 0:40:48.560000::How come the bottom lip is always seemingly
0:40:48.560000 - 0:40:52.160000::to be the big one if you do have one that's more bigger?
0:40:52.160000 - 0:40:54.720000::Is it what's to hold the water, it's gravity.
0:40:54.720000 - 0:40:57.040000::Simply, it must be gravity to hold that water
0:40:57.040000 - 0:40:58.560000::if you got a mouthful.
0:40:58.560000 - 0:41:01.080000::If that was a thin one, it'd spill all out.
0:41:01.080000 - 0:41:01.920000::How's your head in one way?
0:41:01.920000 - 0:41:04.480000::Now, could you get a surgery to switch it?
0:41:05.600000 - 0:41:06.440000::I'm sure.
0:41:06.440000 - 0:41:08.240000::Of course you could.
0:41:08.240000 - 0:41:12.480000::You got that fat lower lip, Jack, I'll say it right now.
0:41:12.480000 - 0:41:14.480000::And the top one's a little thin,
0:41:14.480000 - 0:41:17.080000::not that that's in some cultures that's very sexy.
0:41:19.120000 - 0:41:22.800000::I feel like I don't know who I am without my mustache.
0:41:22.800000 - 0:41:27.080000::Are you having a full identity crisis right now?
0:41:28.080000 - 0:41:29.880000::I think you look good to be honest.
0:41:29.880000 - 0:41:31.080000::You look fresh.
0:41:31.080000 - 0:41:33.200000::You look vibrant.
0:41:33.200000 - 0:41:36.080000::You look like you're glowing, dude.
0:41:36.080000 - 0:41:38.400000::Nate, how did I look with a shave face?
0:41:40.480000 - 0:41:41.480000::I am.
0:41:43.560000 - 0:41:46.320000::Eric, you look like a hamster with the chemo treatment.
0:41:46.320000 - 0:41:47.160000::A little bit.
0:41:48.240000 - 0:41:49.840000::And why don't they do that, by the way?
0:41:49.840000 - 0:41:52.480000::We just give up on the antics ways.
0:41:52.480000 - 0:41:54.880000::My brother had a hamster named Benny
0:41:54.880000 - 0:41:57.520000::who had a testicular tumor.
0:41:57.520000 - 0:42:02.280000::And he was dragging that shit around for a long time.
0:42:02.280000 - 0:42:03.960000::And now, if you had tumor coming out,
0:42:03.960000 - 0:42:04.800000::it's...
0:42:06.720000 - 0:42:09::And then we buried him in a Nike box.
0:42:09 - 0:42:10.320000::Oh.
0:42:10.320000 - 0:42:11.160000::Shout out to you.
0:42:11.160000 - 0:42:13.160000::You'd be so lucky to get buried in Nike.
0:42:13.160000 - 0:42:14::I know.
0:42:14 - 0:42:15.200000::As a human.
0:42:15.200000 - 0:42:20.160000::And then I was rototelling the back of our backyard.
0:42:20.160000 - 0:42:22.280000::And I accidentally...
0:42:22.280000 - 0:42:24.200000::It was a shallow grave.
0:42:24.200000 - 0:42:25.480000::I accidentally tore that box up.
0:42:25.480000 - 0:42:27.600000::There was orange fucking box all over the place.
0:42:27.600000 - 0:42:30.160000::Oh, and you had that.
0:42:30.160000 - 0:42:33.040000::So I disrespected the corpse of Benny, the hamster.
0:42:33.040000 - 0:42:34.200000::I'll just say it right now.
0:42:34.200000 - 0:42:35.880000::I've been holding that in for...
0:42:35.880000 - 0:42:38.720000::16 years or so.
0:42:38.720000 - 0:42:40.240000::16 years or so.
0:42:40.240000 - 0:42:41.080000::Damn.
0:42:41.920000 - 0:42:43::Respect.
0:42:43 - 0:42:45.680000::So Eric, do you think this would work medically?
0:42:45.680000 - 0:42:48.880000::And is this a program that we could LLC
0:42:48.880000 - 0:42:50.880000::or trademark right now?
0:42:50.880000 - 0:42:52.400000::This is dark, y'all.
0:42:52.440000 - 0:42:54.880000::It is what it is, though, it's life.
0:42:54.880000 - 0:42:56.200000::If you...
0:42:56.200000 - 0:42:58.080000::Oh, I don't say it.
0:42:59.880000 - 0:43:01.720000::All I'm gonna say is this.
0:43:01.720000 - 0:43:04.880000::If you are being given medicine,
0:43:04.880000 - 0:43:08.280000::and you see a guinea pig that has the same disease as you,
0:43:09.360000 - 0:43:10.440000::share some of that.
0:43:12.440000 - 0:43:13.440000::Okay, yeah.
0:43:13.440000 - 0:43:15.720000::And it's basically a program where you can let guinea pigs
0:43:15.720000 - 0:43:17.880000::slide into the Dr. Thomas in your pocket.
0:43:17.880000 - 0:43:21.120000::We're testing out on rats, you know, medicine for rats.
0:43:21.160000 - 0:43:22.640000::Every episode we...
0:43:22.640000 - 0:43:25.200000::We have rats listening to every episode before we put it out.
0:43:25.200000 - 0:43:26.360000::If you...
0:43:26.360000 - 0:43:28.200000::If your dog is being all distracted,
0:43:28.200000 - 0:43:31.240000::hit him with that 90 milligrams of IVANCE.
0:43:31.240000 - 0:43:33.920000::And just see if they don't behave a little bit.
0:43:33.920000 - 0:43:36.720000::And by the way, fucking shotgun that shit,
0:43:36.720000 - 0:43:38.240000::like you do with the hookah smoke.
0:43:38.240000 - 0:43:39.240000::Shotgun up hill?
0:43:39.240000 - 0:43:40.080000::Shotgun up hill?
0:43:40.080000 - 0:43:41.240000::Shotgun up hill?
0:43:41.240000 - 0:43:42.080000::Shotgun up hill?
0:43:42.080000 - 0:43:42.920000::How do you do that?
0:43:42.920000 - 0:43:44.400000::All the beads out of the middle?
0:43:44.400000 - 0:43:46.120000::Like that.
0:43:46.120000 - 0:43:47.120000::Like that.
0:43:47.120000 - 0:43:50.040000::I'll do 200 milligrams of zooloft.
0:43:51 - 0:43:52.400000::Those beads scare me.
0:43:52.400000 - 0:43:54.400000::I don't like a pill where I can see the beads.
0:43:54.400000 - 0:43:55.400000::I know.
0:43:55.400000 - 0:43:56.880000::I actually don't like that.
0:43:56.880000 - 0:43:57.720000::Yeah.
0:43:57.720000 - 0:43:59.360000::It looks so aesthetically pleasing.
0:43:59.360000 - 0:44:00.200000::I want to...
0:44:00.200000 - 0:44:02.880000::If I ever get into NASCAR like Frankie Minnistyle,
0:44:02.880000 - 0:44:05.200000::I want to drive the IVANCE fucking car.
0:44:06.280000 - 0:44:07.120000::You know what I'm saying?
0:44:07.120000 - 0:44:08.440000::The IVANCE can be your sponsor.
0:44:08.440000 - 0:44:09.280000::Mm-hmm.
0:44:09.280000 - 0:44:10.120000::Yeah, it's going to be shit.
0:44:10.120000 - 0:44:11.120000::Well, that's a good topic.
0:44:11.120000 - 0:44:13.480000::Like what is your NASCAR sponsors?
0:44:13.480000 - 0:44:14.640000::My NASCAR sponsors.
0:44:14.640000 - 0:44:16.920000::You want IVANCE and fucking twizzlers.
0:44:17.920000 - 0:44:19.920000::Five amps and two out of it.
0:44:19.920000 - 0:44:22.360000::It's got to do with the colors too,
0:44:22.360000 - 0:44:26.360000::because you want to design what color is it on my whip.
0:44:26.360000 - 0:44:28.680000::I wonder if the inventors of IVANCE
0:44:28.680000 - 0:44:33.240000::will be basically hung for their crimes?
0:44:33.240000 - 0:44:35.080000::Whoa.
0:44:35.080000 - 0:44:40.240000::I would like to see some public hangings of like...
0:44:40.240000 - 0:44:44.280000::You know how we're always like all these...
0:44:44.280000 - 0:44:47.040000::Like war criminals, politicians, something like that.
0:44:47.040000 - 0:44:50.560000::They should be tried and whatever.
0:44:50.560000 - 0:44:51.640000::But they never do.
0:44:51.640000 - 0:44:55.720000::We never seem to actually try these people dick-chainy.
0:44:55.720000 - 0:44:59.600000::Yeah, I'm talking to your fucking old ass right now, dude.

0:45:00 - 0:45:03.840000::George W. Bush. Yeah, I'm talking to you pal or criminals.
0:45:03.840000 - 0:45:08.360000::What are you guys? When are we going to have only discovered moves the wheels of time?
0:45:09.920000 - 0:45:16.160000::Ocean change. I mean something like that. What blood blood alone moves the wheels of change?
0:45:16.760000 - 0:45:20::What the fuck are you talking about without death?
0:45:20 - 0:45:24.800000::There's no you making a metaphor. No blood. Blood alone moves is something like this
0:45:24.800000 - 0:45:28.600000::that's what's moving the wheels of change. No blood doesn't move. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, listen.
0:45:28.600000 - 0:45:32.360000::Blood alone can't do anything. It would simply be a puddle. The heart.
0:45:34.240000 - 0:45:37.200000::I'm trying to make a heart sound. That's what moves the blood, right?
0:45:40.240000 - 0:45:44.200000::Yeah, man. So what are you saying? The wheels of time?
0:45:44.200000 - 0:45:47.600000::Up change. You're reading so much poetry area.

0:46:05.600000 - 0:46:07.200000::Show it. Remember the pictures of him?
0:46:07.520000 - 0:46:10.480000::Can I shout out a poet real quick? Of course.
0:46:10.480000 - 0:46:14.280000::I know we do that way too much on this podcast. Let's do the last 15 minutes.
0:46:14.280000 - 0:46:17.520000::Just poetry roll out grateful. Well, you guys probably when you guys,

0:46:31.120000 - 0:46:36.760000::What? What? What? Billy Collins has the most simple poetry on the planet.
0:46:36.760000 - 0:46:40.920000::And it makes you it's just like the rain is dropping.
0:46:40.920000 - 0:46:46.880000::I had a coffee today. It does maybe make you know, it's like, I love him.
0:46:46.880000 - 0:46:50.080000::It doesn't even seem like a poem. It's just like he's just kind of writing like
0:46:51.040000 - 0:46:54.960000::un incomplete sentences. He's like the joy tactics of poetry.
0:46:55.600000 - 0:47:00.400000::Yeah, yeah. He's the like, yeah, uh,
0:47:00.400000 - 0:47:05.680000::remedial poetry. This is a remedial podcast. I'm realizing this is not, you know what?
0:47:05.680000 - 0:47:09.760000::It's just not remedial. It's, yeah, maybe it is.
0:47:10.320000 - 0:47:13.360000::Why is that word that because remedial?
0:47:13.360000 - 0:47:18.360000::Well, um, we got to get groupie.
0:47:18.360000 - 0:47:20.560000::What's her name or their name?

0:47:23.360000 - 0:47:26.560000::Rupi the poet, the current poet that is all the lowercase.
0:47:28.560000 - 0:47:29.760000::Remember those poems?
0:47:31.200000 - 0:47:35.760000::Do you think I feel like poetry could have a major comeback in the way that we all,
0:47:35.760000 - 0:47:41.600000::we all said radio was gone. Now podcasts have taken over the world and changed
0:47:42.240000 - 0:47:46::the course of human existence and a poetry is about to pop.
0:47:46 - 0:47:50.240000::I think I used for Patreon, Poem, Patreon.
0:47:50.240000 - 0:47:52.400000::Poetron, Poetron, Patron.
0:47:53.760000 - 0:47:58.480000::Maybe we should put out original poems for a 20, we need a new $50 tier.
0:47:58.480000 - 0:48:00.960000::We all put original poems and drawings. Oh,
0:48:02.080000 - 0:48:06.320000::I mean, there should be a new format because you know the high coup, the five of five.
0:48:06.320000 - 0:48:08.240000::Yeah, yeah. Why isn't there?
0:48:09.200000 - 0:48:11.920000::We could easily make 100 formats like that.
0:48:11.920000 - 0:48:14::72, 118, 2012.
0:48:15.200000 - 0:48:18.560000::I feel like, do you guys feel like so much modern poetry?
0:48:18.560000 - 0:48:22.720000::Or maybe I tried to get into modern, this is maybe modern 10 years ago.
0:48:22.720000 - 0:48:29.360000::But it's like, it's all seemingly lowercase and it's all about like stealing from whole foods
0:48:29.360000 - 0:48:33.520000::and fucking MacBooks and issues.
0:48:33.520000 - 0:48:37.200000::What? Lowercase poetry about stealing whole foods?
0:48:38.400000 - 0:48:42::Maybe some of the listeners can understand what I'm saying.
0:48:42 - 0:48:45.520000::It's not a fully formed thought, but it just cringed me out a little bit.
0:48:45.520000 - 0:48:49.040000::You just think it's like too modern to like poet, you shouldn't be talking about
0:48:49.040000 - 0:48:53.200000::maybe in, in, in PS5 and a poem for real.
0:48:53.200000 - 0:48:57.280000::Right. I just haven't done my due diligence poetry poetically.
0:48:57.280000 - 0:48:58.640000::So, due to diligence?
0:48:58.640000 - 0:49:02.400000::If anybody, if any listeners have some good poets that we need to check out,
0:49:03.120000 - 0:49:06.560000::yeah, let us know because we might need that in the new year.
0:49:08.400000 - 0:49:12.480000::Wait, I literally think I'd hate to interrupt a flow like this.
0:49:12.480000 - 0:49:15.680000::I think I'd just invented an amazing barstool sports segment.
0:49:15.680000 - 0:49:20.160000::Oh, dude, we've been trying to cook on these for a minute, trying to sell them to Dave.
0:49:20.160000 - 0:49:22.320000::I know because the offices are all over the city.
0:49:22.320000 - 0:49:25.680000::You could literally work there and live in like Austin, Texas or like Chicago.
0:49:25.680000 - 0:49:26.560000::Like it's fun to say.
0:49:27.520000 - 0:49:28.880000::I love the culture they have there.

0:49:36.160000 - 0:49:43.920000::Um, it's so, it just blows my mind at how something so insignificant could turn into such a
0:49:44.640000 - 0:49:46.240000::major institution.
0:49:46.240000 - 0:49:49.440000::Because isn't that how he started out just doing pizza reviews?

0:49:57.680000 - 0:50:00::I thought you just proved pizza and then it turned out

0:50:00 - 0:50:02.140000::into like a podcast or something.
0:50:02.140000 - 0:50:03.640000::Well, that's because all you see

0:59:40.480000 - 0:59:42::and
0:59:42 - 0:59:46.200000::It was just a lovely experience to be around those magical
0:59:47 - 0:59:51.080000::magical animals and they got that long necks
0:59:52.080000 - 0:59:55.200000::They really do and there and it goes like this
0:59:55.840000 - 1:00:00.080000::Gilt gilt because they're yucking up the code because the pack of

1:00:00 - 1:00:04.020000::have four stomachs and they take some cut out of one of those stomachs.
1:00:04.020000 - 1:00:05.020000::What?
1:00:05.020000 - 1:00:07.020000::Cut is grass.
1:00:07.020000 - 1:00:11.760000::It's basically organic kimchi that they have grown inside of one of their stomachs
1:00:11.760000 - 1:00:15.360000::and fermented and then they yak it up and just chew on it all day.
1:00:15.360000 - 1:00:16.360000::Yeah.
1:00:16.360000 - 1:00:18.200000::So wait, they, we don't have anything.

1:00:21.100000 - 1:00:24.600000::They are eating something and then they throw up in their mouth and then chew on that
1:00:24.600000 - 1:00:28.040000::fucking puke and then swallow it back down and it goes into the other stomach.
1:00:28.040000 - 1:00:29.720000::No, no, no, no, no, no, chill, chill, chill.
1:00:29.720000 - 1:00:31.820000::They have a couple different stomachs, man.
1:00:31.820000 - 1:00:38.420000::So they eat the grass or the hay and they put it into a stomach without the digestive
1:00:38.420000 - 1:00:39.420000::stuff in it.
1:00:39.420000 - 1:00:43.600000::That's just a little stomach where they can keep some stuff and let it ferment and
1:00:43.600000 - 1:00:47.400000::make that alpaca style kimchi.
1:00:47.400000 - 1:00:48.400000::Bring it back up.
1:00:48.400000 - 1:00:56.560000::Foe free, chewing on the grass, laid it on, free food, and then maybe, I don't know,
1:00:56.560000 - 1:00:59.480000::maybe they do remix it and then eat it and put it in the other stomach.
1:00:59.480000 - 1:01:01.400000::And then maybe they do yak it up.
1:01:01.400000 - 1:01:03.600000::Jack, that sounds like an animal you would design.
1:01:03.600000 - 1:01:10.240000::Like an internal organ system that you would be the chief kind of architect of.
1:01:10.240000 - 1:01:13.080000::That is very true, man.
1:01:13.080000 - 1:01:14.080000::That is true.
1:01:14.080000 - 1:01:15.080000::A kimchi style.
1:01:15.080000 - 1:01:21.360000::The first ever figure out organic kimchi.

1:01:32.800000 - 1:01:33.800000::Take that shit.
1:01:33.800000 - 1:01:34.840000::Eric, what gave you joy?
1:01:34.840000 - 1:01:35.920000::What gave me joy?

1:01:37.440000 - 1:01:41.560000::I so rarely get to see my parents.
1:01:41.560000 - 1:01:49.720000::And so I just got to chalk it up to spend the time with them and their boyfriends and girlfriends.
1:01:49.720000 - 1:01:50.720000::Chillin.
1:01:50.720000 - 1:01:51.720000::I had a casino.

1:02:00.560000 - 1:02:03.600000::I'm down, but barely.
1:02:03.600000 - 1:02:05.400000::Because I went down pretty severely.
1:02:05.400000 - 1:02:09.040000::And we're talking down 60 bucks.
1:02:09.040000 - 1:02:14.880000::And then then I was only down 10 because I got to save up.
1:02:14.880000 - 1:02:15.880000::Never.
1:02:15.880000 - 1:02:17.880000::Always down.

1:02:36.040000 - 1:02:37.040000::Or for not going to there.
1:02:37.040000 - 1:02:38.720000::We're doing it by the way.
1:02:38.720000 - 1:02:39.720000::You know, it gives me joy.

1:02:59.920000 - 1:03:01.680000::But I think there's going to be some dark moments.
1:03:01.680000 - 1:03:06.120000::So I think we need to like party it up in Berlin for like a couple of months.
1:03:06.120000 - 1:03:07.520000::And then go to Long Year Bien.

1:03:22.120000 - 1:03:25.600000::Because you have to take like three three planes to get there because you got a switch.
1:03:25.600000 - 1:03:28.320000::It's like transferring to the the the patrons.
1:03:28.320000 - 1:03:32.240000::I don't know if you guys are getting messages, but the patrons are begging us to get our
1:03:32.240000 - 1:03:33.240000::asses up there.
1:03:33.240000 - 1:03:36.640000::Do a little bit of journalism show what it's like.

1:03:46.800000 - 1:03:49.800000::That would have been nice if we started the podcast a year before that.
1:03:49.800000 - 1:03:52.920000::And then during the strike, we maybe could have liked.
1:03:52.920000 - 1:03:58.800000::Next time there is a sort of pandemic, a strike, some kind of event.
1:03:58.800000 - 1:04:02.720000::I feel like day one, we need to be like, right, go to.

1:08:18.280000 - 1:08:23.280000::friend Bryce. We did that. My friend Bryce, I met up with my friend Bryce, who works at an
1:08:23.280000 - 1:08:29.280000::assisted living center, which we've been talking about the future investing in some sort
1:08:29.280000 - 1:08:38.280000::of crisis out of there. Huh? He lives in the assisted living. No, he works at one. Oh, excellent.

1:08:45.280000 - 1:08:51.280000::have an apparent that is elderly, what's going on? That is going into one of these centers called Sunrise
1:08:51.280000 - 1:08:58.280000::Living. Okay. If you have a parent or an uncle and a grandparent, that's about to be in the

1:09:15.280000 - 1:09:20.280000::know that we care for the elderly more than most people and a lot of people forget about
1:09:20.280000 - 1:09:25.280000::them, not us. So, we're trying to help these people out. And I've been to the busted. I've had
1:09:25.280000 - 1:09:29.280000::a grandparent in one of these nursing homes that was fucked up and bad and the people were
1:09:29.280000 - 1:09:34.280000::stealing from them. And we can't be doing that. These are our elders. These are people with
1:09:34.280000 - 1:09:40.280000::wisdom. We need to be boosting them up. We need to be taking care of them as they exit into
1:09:40.280000 - 1:09:47.280000::the next chapter of their existence. Okay. So hit me up if you're in need for some sort
