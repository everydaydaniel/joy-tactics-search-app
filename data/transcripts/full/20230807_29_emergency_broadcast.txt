0:03:07 - 0:03:17::I have until. Hey, man. What are you doing? I'm getting gladiated with the enchiladas up in the bed. No shirt. Just fucking licking the sauce out of my belly button using it like a little ramican.

0:06:23.040000 - 0:06:30.140000::Mm-hmm and this guy was really old. He was like drunk as fuck just sitting by himself at this fire pit
0:06:30.800000 - 0:06:34.960000::Just torching back cigarettes and he was telling us about his fucking
0:06:35.760000 - 0:06:41.040000::His like a strange daughter. He was just one of those kind of broken older men that is maybe
0:06:41.760000 - 0:06:45.280000::Like a trucker or something like that. We don't mean no people like this
0:06:45.280000 - 0:06:49.240000::It used to be that you were meeting people like this every fucking at church or you know what I mean?

0:06:56.960000 - 0:07:01.680000::They're so boring man. It's like 20s people in their 20s are fucking exciting
0:07:01.680000 - 0:07:06.800000::I fucking love chilling people in their 20s. There's nothing better now some people in their 40s though as well
0:07:07.520000 - 0:07:11.280000::They have hit it what's called a second win once they ditch that fucking first first
0:07:12.240000 - 0:07:14.480000::Spouse right and get the fun back in their spine
0:07:15.680000 - 0:07:17.680000::Wake up

0:07:21.360000 - 0:07:25.680000::Every everyone in their 30s is just like pissed off that they fucked up in their 20s
0:07:26.240000 - 0:07:28.240000::Because the 20s is so fun
0:07:28.240000 - 0:07:33.440000::But there's gonna be a point when you win all that shit is going to become crashing down which Eric is experiencing right now
0:07:36.240000 - 0:07:39.360000::Did you guys do you guys think we fucked up badly in our 20s?
0:07:41.280000 - 0:07:46.560000::I know not at all for real. I don't think I don't think I did but I do look back and I'm like
0:07:47.200000 - 0:07:54.880000::God damn it like I really there's just a lot of a lot of wasted time and a good way in a bad way too
0:07:55.520000 - 0:08:01.280000::I'll look but here's the thing that's my that's what I'm best at that's what I like to do in this life is a waste fucking time sitting around
0:08:01.920000 - 0:08:04.960000::You know I mean and it was all being fucking entertainment
0:08:05.440000 - 0:08:10.480000::Eric you're the Michael Jordan of wasting time. I really am. I really fucking am
0:08:11.360000 - 0:08:17.040000::Does that make it like a task you know what I mean? We're just like oh I got a fucking turn on the tea like I was sitting
0:08:18.400000 - 0:08:24.080000::Down today and I wanted to go get a shelter and it took me about 20 minutes to go get fucking up from bed to go get
0:08:24.400000 - 0:08:27.280000::And I was thirsty too. I had a basic human need to drink
0:08:28.800000 - 0:08:32.240000::Yeah, that is a lot of jack you're also get out wasting time shut up bitch
0:08:34.720000 - 0:08:37.600000::I'm not out waste time. I'm a fucking time hacker dude
0:08:38.160000 - 0:08:41.920000::I'll fucking like like you think it's wasting time but really
0:08:42.720000 - 0:08:44.240000::I'm doing
0:08:44.240000 - 0:08:48.720000::Watching entertainment while working out while writing a video while
0:08:49.840000 - 0:08:52.480000::Depositives to somebody my family while
0:08:55.440000 - 0:09:03.360000::Whatever more to paste I have I have I feel like I've done enough stuff to where I have
0:09:03.840000 - 0:09:08.560000::I'm allowed to waste some time I've basically done more than anybody the 100 year olds that were walking the earth
0:09:09.040000 - 0:09:12.320000::They're getting their legs all up in the mud back in the day
0:09:12.800000 - 0:09:15.680000::They haven't even even close to this time amounts of stuff I've done
0:09:16.400000 - 0:09:20.400000::I've done so many things in my life is what I'm trying to say more than one lifetime
0:09:22.400000 - 0:09:24.400000::Can I share a physics fact you guys?
0:09:24.800000 - 0:09:27.600000::Can't believe you never have to has permission for that
0:09:28.480000 - 0:09:32.800000::Well, I don't know if this is like some kind of third grade knowledge or
0:09:32.880000 - 0:09:34.880000::Tell me if you guys know this but
0:09:35.200000 - 0:09:37.200000::If you go at the speed of light
0:09:37.280000 - 0:09:38.640000::Einstein
0:09:38.640000 - 0:09:40.640000::One of the most famous scientists ever
0:09:41.440000 - 0:09:47.440000::Um, this is one of his theories. I think it's been proven. Well, I don't know if as I don't know if you can prove it at this point
0:09:47.520000 - 0:09:51.200000::But it's pretty likely that it's this would happen if you were to
0:09:51.920000 - 0:09:53.920000::Anyways, if you go the speed of light
0:09:54.560000 - 0:09:56.560000::If you're in a ship that goes the speed of light
0:09:57.200000 - 0:09:59.200000::You basically don't age

0:10:00 - 0:10:05::And I don't know how this works, but have you guys heard this before?
0:10:05 - 0:10:06::No.
0:10:06 - 0:10:13.280000::So you're saying that if I can somehow build a kite and attach my arms to it and stand
0:10:13.280000 - 0:10:18.520000::in front of a flood light with enough electricity behind it to where it picks me up and launches
0:10:18.520000 - 0:10:25.720000::me on it like a wave that I can look fucking 16 when I'm 72.
0:10:25.720000 - 0:10:28.400000::That's exactly what I'm saying.
0:10:28.400000 - 0:10:32.400000::That is exactly just wow.
0:10:32.400000 - 0:10:33.880000::Well, then it made sense to me.
0:10:33.880000 - 0:10:35.880000::You took the words out of my mouth.
0:10:35.880000 - 0:10:36.880000::Yeah.
0:10:36.880000 - 0:10:43::Basically, if you put it, well, what that doesn't make sense to me honestly is because if
0:10:43 - 0:10:46.120000::you're standing on a moving truck like James Bond and you throw a tennis ball in the
0:10:46.120000 - 0:10:48.240000::air, you guys know that trick.
0:10:48.240000 - 0:10:51.200000::The tennis ball doesn't go flying backwards.
0:10:51.200000 - 0:10:58.480000::So if you were traveling with light, would you simply be aging on the light beam and if
0:10:58.480000 - 0:11:04.760000::somebody looked out, it would look to them like you were the same age because the light
0:11:04.760000 - 0:11:07.760000::is taking so long to get to you that you're seeing it at one age.
0:11:07.760000 - 0:11:12.760000::Or if you were on the light with somebody else going the same speed, would you both to
0:11:12.760000 - 0:11:17.120000::each other not look like you should have been a physicist.
0:11:17.120000 - 0:11:20.400000::You should have definitely been assigned to major.
0:11:20.400000 - 0:11:25.240000::You were asking questions that like, this is what how physicists think, dude.
0:11:25.240000 - 0:11:26.240000::There is there.
0:11:26.240000 - 0:11:31.480000::I watched a video on this, kind of the exact thing that you're describing right now and
0:11:31.480000 - 0:11:33.920000::it was saying that like time is.
0:11:33.920000 - 0:11:39.880000::I don't know if it's like I literally don't know what I'm fucking talking about.
0:11:39.880000 - 0:11:41.240000::Like I'm not gonna even finish this.
0:11:41.240000 - 0:11:42.240000::Can I jump in?
0:11:42.240000 - 0:11:43.240000::Can I jump in?
0:11:43.240000 - 0:11:44.240000::Yes, please.
0:11:44.240000 - 0:11:45.240000::All right.
0:11:45.240000 - 0:11:48.840000::So here's a thing about time, right?
0:11:48.840000 - 0:11:51.960000::I maybe have said this before.
0:11:51.960000 - 0:11:58.200000::Time to me is the same thing as an inch, right?
0:11:58.200000 - 0:12:02.280000::Does that ooze?
0:12:02.280000 - 0:12:04.280000::Good.
0:12:04.280000 - 0:12:05.280000::Good.
0:12:05.280000 - 0:12:10.440000::Time doesn't exist.
0:12:10.440000 - 0:12:14.800000::It's something that, oh fuck, how do I say this?
0:12:15.800000 - 0:12:24.800000::It exists as an organization of the representation of the fact that things change.
0:12:24.800000 - 0:12:25.800000::Yes.
0:12:25.800000 - 0:12:26.800000::Right?
0:12:26.800000 - 0:12:27.800000::Yes.
0:12:27.800000 - 0:12:34.160000::The fact that molecules move, the fact that everything decomposes and grows is.
0:12:34.160000 - 0:12:35.640000::But time isn't real.
0:12:35.640000 - 0:12:39.640000::In the same sense?
0:12:40.640000 - 0:12:46.640000::Eric, you just froze and don't, is he on frozen yet?
0:12:46.640000 - 0:12:51.640000::What are the, we all need to, what happened, man?
0:12:51.640000 - 0:12:54.640000::Eric just froze for a second.
0:12:54.640000 - 0:13:01.320000::He frozen away that made it sound like you were having stroke.
0:13:01.320000 - 0:13:05::I think that, I think that Eric, yeah, you're back.
0:13:05 - 0:13:09.560000::Eric, we need to all get one single community college degree.
0:13:09.560000 - 0:13:15.720000::I feel like we, we all need to like take turns taking the different classes and we either
0:13:15.720000 - 0:13:20.880000::speed it up or go at the pace of, you know, but we could all kind of share one.
0:13:20.880000 - 0:13:21.880000::What should we major in?
0:13:21.880000 - 0:13:22.880000::You know, what, what do you think?
0:13:22.880000 - 0:13:27.560000::Well, you already made it in English, right, Nate?
0:13:27.560000 - 0:13:29.360000::Uh, yeah.
0:13:29.360000 - 0:13:34.320000::So we have English journalism, Jack, uh, Jack and comedy comedy.
0:13:34.320000 - 0:13:38.640000::Well, YouTube, YouTube, YouTube, I've learned a lot.
0:13:38.640000 - 0:13:42.560000::Um, no, we should major in something like fucking social justice.
0:13:42.560000 - 0:13:44.560000::Well, you know what I mean?
0:13:44.560000 - 0:13:46.120000::You don't have to join the army.
0:13:46.120000 - 0:13:50.360000::No, I want to join the fucking army of lawyers.
0:13:50.360000 - 0:13:52.360000::That will take down Trump.
0:13:52.360000 - 0:13:54.520000::Well, they're going to be AI'd.
0:13:54.520000 - 0:13:56.640000::Oh, oh, lawyers will be AI'd.
0:13:56.640000 - 0:13:58.240000::That's what they say.
0:13:58.240000 - 0:14:00.320000::But can I say something here?
0:14:00.320000 - 0:14:04.040000::If the three of us were in, I'm just imagining this.
0:14:04.040000 - 0:14:09.440000::The three of us are in like a high school class and we have to do a project together.
0:14:09.440000 - 0:14:15.720000::For some reason, I can feel like Eric, you would be very frustrated with me and Nate.
0:14:15.720000 - 0:14:16.720000::I would be.
0:14:16.720000 - 0:14:17.720000::I guess.

0:15:49.320000 - 0:15:53.080000::Because the the public school I went to that had a larger school system was like
0:15:53.800000 - 0:15:57.720000::Light years ahead of what I was learning and I was like bodying the country school

0:16:23.080000 - 0:16:27.560000::No, there was a bunch of dumbass country people that were just like they don't fucking
0:16:27.720000 - 0:16:32.680000::They're like just did not care about school at all like they had their their priorities were
0:16:34 - 0:16:41.200000::Just they kind of lived the good life though. They had the their priorities line. What were they fucking doing with their time?

0:17:25.960000 - 0:17:27.960000::That had to be honest
0:17:28.280000 - 0:17:30.280000::Do you think that was real though?
0:17:31.280000 - 0:17:33.280000::But why would they lie?
0:17:33.760000 - 0:17:35.760000::I believe that what
0:17:35.760000 - 0:17:40.940000::No, Rogan no, he said no, Rogan. He's this very famous influential podcast if you don't know
0:17:41.060000 - 0:17:47.500000::He was responding to a clip where it's like it says like dad beats up son in boxing match
0:17:48.340000 - 0:17:52.560000::And then it turns like watching it in Joe's like going off on this
0:17:53.220000 - 0:18:00.260000::Monologue about like why is this funny or entertaining or cool? That is a father who is literally
0:18:00.660000 - 0:18:06.860000::Punching their son. They could they could literally physically injured them in a way that could give them a question and change their life
0:18:07.020000 - 0:18:09.020000::Why would they do that?
0:18:09.020000 - 0:18:11.580000::and then the the computer guys like oh
0:18:12.540000 - 0:18:18.400000::This is real yeah, Jamie's like oh, this isn't real. This is like a stunt boxing shows like
0:18:19.140000 - 0:18:21.140000::influencer like they're just joking
0:18:22.140000 - 0:18:29.380000::And then Joe Rogan goes but it says this in the title because yeah, I think they just do like clickbait and Joe's like
0:18:30.140000 - 0:18:32.140000::Why does it lie?
0:18:32.740000 - 0:18:34.740000::He's a one to lie
0:18:34.740000 - 0:18:40.860000::This phrase he says is why does it lie in a way that sounds like like a six-year-old like
0:18:42.340000 - 0:18:45.140000::Oh my god protect protect this man because
0:18:46.060000 - 0:18:48.820000::He is what you call trickable. He's pure
0:18:50.860000 - 0:18:55.120000::You think Joe Rogan has ever had bad intentions about anything in his entire life. No
0:18:56.100000 - 0:19:01.980000::Good pure moving on to the next subject. Thank you. Nope. No, he has it. He hasn't
0:19:01.980000 - 0:19:07.900000::Let's sing something for once. We haven't made never when you sang the stars bangle banner. That was so fun, man

0:20:23 - 0:20:26::And I wrote a verse for a song but.
0:20:26 - 0:20:27::Are you serious?
0:20:27 - 0:20:29::Yeah I did and it's really, it's hyper.
0:20:29 - 0:20:32::It's hyper, hyper speed, hyper sonic cringe.
0:20:32 - 0:20:36::Just on your own, you do this for no reason at all.

0:20:41 - 0:20:46::that with like scar anybody who ever tried to look at me in the eyes ever again.
0:20:46 - 0:20:50::Some wraps are ruined a song.

0:21:15 - 0:21:18::like so hard while they're wrapping over.
0:21:18 - 0:21:21::I think they have some song together.
0:21:21 - 0:21:24::She, she's going to come out as a hardcore conservative.
0:21:24 - 0:21:26::There's no question in my mind.

0:22:07 - 0:22:08::Yeah.
0:22:08 - 0:22:12::Well, hello, you beautiful, you beautiful six million minds.
0:22:12 - 0:22:14::Have you seen his YouTube channel?
0:22:14 - 0:22:15::He, he tricked me.
0:22:15 - 0:22:16::Of course I've seen his YouTube channel.
0:22:16 - 0:22:17::He tricked me, dude.
0:22:17 - 0:22:18::He tricked you.
0:22:18 - 0:22:19::How?
0:22:19 - 0:22:24::He, I mean, I just, I was enamored by him in forgetting to say, Mark, I'm sorry.
0:22:24 - 0:22:27::I mean, forgetting to say, Marshall, get him to the Greek.
0:22:27 - 0:22:31::I like wanted to be fucking Russell Brand for a minute.
0:22:31 - 0:22:33::He could have had it good.
0:22:33 - 0:22:34::You know what I'm saying?
0:22:34 - 0:22:38::And he tripped all up over himself.
0:22:38 - 0:22:39::Okay.
0:22:39 - 0:22:40::Did he get canceled or some shit?
0:22:40 - 0:22:41::Yeah.
0:22:41 - 0:22:42::He did.
0:22:42 - 0:22:43::Did he really?
0:22:43 - 0:22:45::I think he kind of did.
0:22:45 - 0:22:48::I was, I was wondering like, why?
0:22:48 - 0:22:52::I don't think you got for real cancel, but I bet you some shit's on the way, dude.
0:22:52 - 0:22:57::I'm just gonna see what Russell Brand's latest YouTube videos are because that he only talks
0:22:57 - 0:22:59::about the most important subjects.
0:22:59 - 0:23:00::You guys know that?
0:23:00 - 0:23:01::Oh, yeah.
0:23:01 - 0:23:08::All in paper, like Russell Brand is a good force in this world because I feel like he wants
0:23:08 - 0:23:19.500000::to talk about like, you know, spirituality and, you know, like health and the truth in
0:23:19.500000 - 0:23:21.500000::politics or whatever.
0:23:21.500000 - 0:23:22.500000::I don't even know.
0:23:22.500000 - 0:23:27.500000::But he just though, it's just kind of like the, I guess it's his whole style.
0:23:27.500000 - 0:23:31.500000::I just hate like if he looked like one of us and was saying the same shit that he said,
0:23:31.500000 - 0:23:36.500000::I probably wouldn't have much of a much of a problem with him.
0:23:36.500000 - 0:23:38.500000::He just looks so wretched.
0:23:38.500000 - 0:23:39.500000::He's still rocks.
0:23:39.500000 - 0:23:44.500000::He's trying to be like a truth teller, you know, he's doing master clickbait.
0:23:44.500000 - 0:23:45.500000::Master click.
0:23:45.500000 - 0:23:48.500000::He just did the alien bodies.
0:23:48.500000 - 0:23:50.500000::He's got he's going off on the UFO.
0:23:50.500000 - 0:23:58.500000::He's got a, he's got a clip from two days ago that's him with Anthony Fauci and it says
0:23:58.500000 - 0:24:00.500000::look at that wet market.
0:24:00.500000 - 0:24:04.500000::Remember this bullshit.
0:24:04.500000 - 0:24:06.500000::Russell Brand's brand.
0:24:06.500000 - 0:24:07.500000::Brand.
0:24:07.500000 - 0:24:08.500000::Oh my god.
0:24:08.500000 - 0:24:09.500000::Brand.
0:24:09.500000 - 0:24:10.500000::The brand.
0:24:10.500000 - 0:24:11.500000::Very rare.
0:24:11.500000 - 0:24:12.500000::Yeah.
0:24:12.500000 - 0:24:13.500000::The Panda.
0:24:13.500000 - 0:24:14.500000::By the way.
0:24:14.500000 - 0:24:17.500000::ası
0:24:17.500000 - 0:24:18.500000::We can't do this.
0:24:18.500000 - 0:24:19.500000::Exactly.
0:24:19.500000 - 0:24:20.500000::We can't do anything.
0:24:20.500000 - 0:24:21.500000::There is a lot more trouble than that.
0:24:21.500000 - 0:24:23.500000::I'm doing 2022.
0:24:23.500000 - 0:24:25.500000::Then I'm not that if I don't succeed tomorrow, but I'm looking, mate, you know, like,
0:24:25.500000 - 0:24:26.500000::your last one we don't get audio.
0:24:26.500000 - 0:24:28.500000::Can you clean it, we got a crowd.
0:24:28.500000 - 0:24:29.500000::We get that clarity.
0:24:29.500000 - 0:24:32.500000::Like, you know, that you got some circle film and that just like trees and flying.
0:24:32.500000 - 0:24:36.380000::And that's not the only time that I was, but that executive actor and, you know,
0:24:36.380000 - 0:24:37.860000::asked me that since then because eventually you know, I've been so, never forget,
0:24:37.860000 - 0:24:39.060000::like, you know, those didn't do.
0:24:39.060000 - 0:24:43.700000::six months it could be a relationship three weeks could be at least in five years or now, but I think
0:24:43.700000 - 0:24:50.340000::that this is a fun little time capsule where we can predict things that will probably come to fruition
0:24:50.340000 - 0:24:55.620000::because we have some of the basically our minds are tapped into an antenna that can predict
0:24:56.420000 - 0:25:00.020000::the future realities and the fabric of the vessel. Russell Brand will be finally

0:25:00 - 0:25:02.320000::I'm fucking, have been crushed to death by...
0:25:02.320000 - 0:25:06.960000::So I'm an ancient rock that he was praying to
0:25:06.960000 - 0:25:10.480000::and fucking New Mexico trying to make out what to rock
0:25:10.480000 - 0:25:12.160000::and then it's gonna crush his ass.
0:25:12.160000 - 0:25:13.480000::Mish.
0:25:13.480000 - 0:25:14.320000::Smosh.
0:25:15.280000 - 0:25:18.160000::There's gonna be an iPod that's...
0:25:22.360000 - 0:25:23.440000::I don't know man.
0:25:23.440000 - 0:25:25.280000::What's gonna happen with the iPod dude?
0:25:25.280000 - 0:25:26.440000::I wanna hear.
0:25:26.440000 - 0:25:28.520000::I'll next up, I guess iPhone,
0:25:28.520000 - 0:25:30.040000::I don't have iPods anymore.
0:25:30.040000 - 0:25:32.720000::So how many years in the future are we talking?
0:25:32.720000 - 0:25:34.280000::Could be three years in the future.
0:25:34.280000 - 0:25:35.120000::Okay, let's see.
0:25:35.120000 - 0:25:35.960000::Three, three.
0:25:35.960000 - 0:25:38.880000::All right, there's gonna be an iPhone that...
0:25:41.560000 - 0:25:43.760000::You can screw your feet and feel pain.
0:25:43.760000 - 0:25:44.760000::Can fit...
0:25:46.720000 - 0:25:48.720000::The headphones...
0:25:48.720000 - 0:25:50.120000::That you can milk.
0:25:50.120000 - 0:25:51.760000::That you can milk the headphones?
0:25:51.760000 - 0:25:52.760000::Grrrr.
0:25:55 - 0:25:57.560000::Oh, there's gonna be an iPhone ball.
0:25:57.720000 - 0:25:59.720000::That's my prediction.
0:25:59.720000 - 0:26:02.560000::3D print the milk and it has an utterer on top
0:26:02.560000 - 0:26:04.160000::and you can milk it out.
0:26:04.160000 - 0:26:05.600000::What you're about to make.
0:26:05.600000 - 0:26:06.840000::You can milk out of guns.
0:26:07.840000 - 0:26:09.040000::Milk gun.
0:26:09.040000 - 0:26:09.840000::The milk purer.
0:26:09.840000 - 0:26:12.320000::Do you think any milk would come out if they suck the...
0:26:12.320000 - 0:26:14.240000::They suck so fucking harder than your nipples,
0:26:14.240000 - 0:26:15.400000::like harder than anything.
0:26:15.400000 - 0:26:16.240000::Oh yeah, almost.
0:26:16.240000 - 0:26:17.080000::The nipples?
0:26:17.080000 - 0:26:18.400000::Yeah.
0:26:18.400000 - 0:26:19.560000::Oh hell yeah.
0:26:19.560000 - 0:26:20.960000::Well you milk easily.
0:26:20.960000 - 0:26:25.080000::It takes almost no stimulation to get you milk and Nate.
0:26:25.080000 - 0:26:27.960000::You get to a moron calm that touches either on what
0:26:27.960000 - 0:26:29.480000::you're milking in the theater.
0:26:29.480000 - 0:26:30.360000::I'm on...
0:26:30.360000 - 0:26:32.960000::I'm gonna size that's too small t-shirt.
0:26:32.960000 - 0:26:33.800000::It's milk.
0:26:33.800000 - 0:26:34.640000::Milk is good.
0:26:34.640000 - 0:26:36::Oh dude, Nate, you said milk.
0:26:36 - 0:26:37::Milk.
0:26:37 - 0:26:42::Nate'll hop onto the bar at the fucking variety coffee shop
0:26:42.520000 - 0:26:44.600000::at the fucking Pete's coffee
0:26:44.600000 - 0:26:47.160000::and give it a little squirt up in the Frappuccino.
0:26:47.160000 - 0:26:48::No, no, I got it.
0:26:48 - 0:26:49.520000::You be on a cream or sugar in this?
0:26:49.520000 - 0:26:50.840000::No, no.
0:26:50.840000 - 0:26:52.840000::It's on, I already got that thing on me.
0:26:52.840000 - 0:26:54.560000::And you got sugar too.
0:26:54.560000 - 0:26:56.360000::Scratch on the top of your head.
0:26:56.360000 - 0:26:57.360000::Nasty.
0:26:57.360000 - 0:27:00.560000::You had to get escorted out of the fucking night of the museum
0:27:00.560000 - 0:27:01.400000::when you inside that,
0:27:01.400000 - 0:27:02.840000::because you were milking too hard,
0:27:02.840000 - 0:27:04.680000::just looking at Owen Wilson.
0:27:04.680000 - 0:27:05.680000::You know what I mean?
0:27:05.680000 - 0:27:08.680000::Nate just turns out like a...
0:27:08.680000 - 0:27:11.880000::Nate's turned on by small things.
0:27:11.880000 - 0:27:12.720000::Yeah, yeah.
0:27:12.720000 - 0:27:14.600000::He's the little ass.
0:27:14.600000 - 0:27:15.440000::Cowboy.
0:27:15.440000 - 0:27:18.960000::I don't say my milk comes out like a fucking fire hose.
0:27:18.960000 - 0:27:21.280000::Oh Nate, blast me back like propels you.
0:27:21.280000 - 0:27:22.280000::Tshuh!
0:27:22.280000 - 0:27:24.240000::And I'm like wailing around like trying to...
0:27:24.760000 - 0:27:26.600000::Can I just say milk is so...
0:27:26.600000 - 0:27:29.320000::Milk is so fucking crazy.
0:27:29.320000 - 0:27:31.640000::Are you serious milk?
0:27:31.640000 - 0:27:33.320000::And we're drinking milk.
0:27:33.320000 - 0:27:36.440000::And that's in the donor episode, man.
0:27:36.440000 - 0:27:37.960000::Oh my God.
0:27:37.960000 - 0:27:40::Well, it might as well be.
0:27:40 - 0:27:42.240000::I just can't believe that.
0:27:42.240000 - 0:27:43.520000::So what the hell is milk?
0:27:43.520000 - 0:27:45.200000::Well, everything is liquid.
0:27:45.200000 - 0:27:46.760000::That gets fucking pumped through.
0:27:46.760000 - 0:27:47.920000::It gets extra neutral.
0:27:47.920000 - 0:27:50.080000::Nobody ever explaining me what milk is.
0:27:50.080000 - 0:27:52::Coffee is being milk.
0:27:52 - 0:27:54.080000::Everything in life can be milk.
0:27:54.080000 - 0:27:56.240000::If you just put water through it,
0:27:56.240000 - 0:27:58.160000::the outside, when it comes out the other side,
0:27:58.160000 - 0:27:59.720000::we just call it milk these days.
0:27:59.720000 - 0:28:01.520000::The only true milk is the milk
0:28:01.520000 - 0:28:02.920000::which comes from the mother's breast.
0:28:02.920000 - 0:28:05.240000::But we want to say it's nut milk because it's white
0:28:05.240000 - 0:28:07.120000::and because it's water that's been soaked
0:28:07.120000 - 0:28:08.320000::with the essence of a nut.
0:28:08.320000 - 0:28:09.640000::I don't know if that's true.
0:28:09.640000 - 0:28:10.880000::I don't know if that's milk.
0:28:10.880000 - 0:28:12.360000::It's a milk substitute.
0:28:12.360000 - 0:28:13.200000::But guess what?
0:28:13.200000 - 0:28:14.200000::So is all.
0:28:14.200000 - 0:28:16.040000::So is milk.
0:28:16.040000 - 0:28:17.040000::Nut milk.
0:28:17.040000 - 0:28:19.640000::I don't know about a different type of nut milk.
0:28:19.640000 - 0:28:20.480000::Here.
0:28:20.480000 - 0:28:21.320000::Oh.
0:28:22.320000 - 0:28:23.320000::You're fine.
0:28:23.320000 - 0:28:25.320000::If you tried to milk your nipple,
0:28:25.320000 - 0:28:27.840000::like I bet it would like the tiniest little bit
0:28:27.840000 - 0:28:28.880000::of something would come out.
0:28:28.880000 - 0:28:31.320000::And it would be like yellow and like sledge.
0:28:31.320000 - 0:28:32.320000::Amen.
0:28:32.320000 - 0:28:33.320000::Amen.
0:28:33.320000 - 0:28:34.320000::What the fuck?
0:28:34.320000 - 0:28:35.320000::What the fuck?
0:28:35.320000 - 0:28:36.320000::Why?
0:28:36.320000 - 0:28:38.160000::Why, man?
0:28:38.160000 - 0:28:39.160000::That's not right.
0:28:39.160000 - 0:28:42.760000::Because I ate two bags of cheese girls today.
0:28:42.760000 - 0:28:44.920000::You know what?
0:28:44.920000 - 0:28:46.080000::I was eating cheese.
0:28:46.080000 - 0:28:49.320000::I know that we're only at, am I rolling audio?
0:28:49.320000 - 0:28:49.920000::Yes.
0:28:49.920000 - 0:28:52.120000::I know that we're about halfway through the pod cast
0:28:52.120000 - 0:28:53.720000::episode and such.
0:28:53.720000 - 0:28:56.640000::But I just want to tease what gave me joy.
0:28:56.640000 - 0:28:57.640000::You know what?
0:28:57.640000 - 0:29:02.480000::I'm going to say that remind me to talk about how
0:29:02.480000 - 0:29:04.920000::cheese girls gave me joy at the end of this one.
0:29:04.920000 - 0:29:06.320000::You know, I just go out of it right now.
0:29:06.320000 - 0:29:07.320000::Just go.
0:29:07.320000 - 0:29:08.320000::Yeah.
0:29:08.320000 - 0:29:09.320000::We're in the present, do we?
0:29:09.320000 - 0:29:11.720000::We're not playing by the rules on this episode.
0:29:11.720000 - 0:29:12.720000::Yeah.
0:29:12.720000 - 0:29:13.720000::All right.
0:29:13.720000 - 0:29:14.920000::I don't know if this is going to break the joy tactics
0:29:14.920000 - 0:29:15.720000::continuum.
0:29:15.720000 - 0:29:17.920000::If I do what gave me joy in the middle of a,
0:29:18.920000 - 0:29:22.720000::okay, well, I was eating a bag of cheese curls today,
0:29:22.720000 - 0:29:26.320000::not regular ones, the ones that you get at the pool when
0:29:26.320000 - 0:29:28.320000::you're at the public pool's child.
0:29:28.320000 - 0:29:31.620000::And I tasted them and I could taste my soggy fingers soaked
0:29:31.620000 - 0:29:34.220000::in chlorine water.
0:29:34.220000 - 0:29:38.120000::And it just made me want to, it made me want to get my hands
0:29:38.120000 - 0:29:40.120000::all wet and eat cheetos with them.
0:29:40.120000 - 0:29:42.720000::We eat these cheese curls with them.
0:29:44.720000 - 0:29:45.720000::That gave me joy.
0:29:45.720000 - 0:29:47.920000::So what you were eating them with non-chlorine fingers,
0:29:47.920000 - 0:29:50.120000::but it made you think about the chlorine fingers.
0:29:50.120000 - 0:29:51.120000::Yeah, it took me back.
0:29:51.120000 - 0:29:52.120000::Correct.
0:29:52.120000 - 0:29:53.120000::Yep.
0:29:53.120000 - 0:29:57.320000::Did somebody ever tell you guys that like chlorine is good
0:29:57.320000 - 0:29:59.120000::for a cut?
0:29:59.120000 - 0:30:00.120000::Like if you have a

0:32:27.600000 - 0:32:29.040000::the danger of being in a public

0:32:36.080000 - 0:32:37.360000::that type of behavior so there's a

0:35:23.960000 - 0:35:27.360000::It's kind of a classic that people love.
0:35:27.360000 - 0:35:29.360000::The big, labowski.
0:35:29.400000 - 0:35:31.840000::Show me the money, labowski.
0:35:31.840000 - 0:35:32.680000::What is it?
0:35:33.680000 - 0:35:35::Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
0:35:35 - 0:35:37.360000::I don't know the exact question that I'm asking.
0:35:37.360000 - 0:35:39.440000::Anybody who was thinking about putting me in a movie
0:35:39.440000 - 0:35:40.440000::just heard that.
0:35:40.440000 - 0:35:42::And so we have a movie.
0:35:45 - 0:35:47.080000::Okay, well let me ask you guys as it says actors,
0:35:47.080000 - 0:35:48.880000::little actors around table right now.
0:35:48.880000 - 0:35:50.400000::Oh sure.
0:35:50.400000 - 0:35:53.840000::As you know, I'm filming a movie right now.
0:35:53.840000 - 0:35:59.280000::And sometimes it is just so hard to make one single line
0:35:59.280000 - 0:36:00.120000::sound natural.
0:36:00.120000 - 0:36:02.240000::You are not the main character of the scene.
0:36:02.240000 - 0:36:05.160000::You just are thropp peppering in one single thing.
0:36:05.160000 - 0:36:08.560000::That to me is always the hardest thing to make sound real.
0:36:08.560000 - 0:36:09.400000::You know what I mean?
0:36:09.400000 - 0:36:11.880000::Someone is on my log and you go like,
0:36:11.880000 - 0:36:14.520000::damn, wish I remember when we all auditioned for that thing
0:36:14.520000 - 0:36:15.360000::on that one show.
0:36:15.360000 - 0:36:16.360000::So yes.
0:36:16.360000 - 0:36:18.480000::Damn, wish I had that.
0:36:18.480000 - 0:36:20.440000::Yeah, of course.
0:36:20.440000 - 0:36:23.040000::Those are always the hardest lines to make them sound real.
0:36:23.040000 - 0:36:25.280000::And you know, there's a cardinal sin over director
0:36:25.280000 - 0:36:27.280000::has never given somebody a line read.
0:36:27.280000 - 0:36:28.120000::Of course.
0:36:28.120000 - 0:36:29.120000::I mean, I'm not going to give you that.
0:36:29.120000 - 0:36:30.960000::But it's kind of like frowned upon to, you know,
0:36:30.960000 - 0:36:33.560000::what actor make their choice themselves, which I thought
0:36:33.560000 - 0:36:34.560000::were you.
0:36:34.560000 - 0:36:35.560000::Tell me the truth.
0:36:35.560000 - 0:36:36.560000::I'm like, give me the rhythm.
0:36:36.560000 - 0:36:39.320000::I'm like, just tell me how you want this.
0:36:39.320000 - 0:36:41.080000::And I'll give you my version.
0:36:41.080000 - 0:36:43.320000::And then you tell me how you want it.
0:36:43.320000 - 0:36:44.160000::Okay.
0:36:44.160000 - 0:36:45.160000::And then we can kind of meet in the middle
0:36:45.160000 - 0:36:46.640000::and we can do two different takes.
0:36:46.640000 - 0:36:48.920000::These with film and stuff, you can do more than one
0:36:48.920000 - 0:36:49.760000::different version of it.
0:36:49.760000 - 0:36:51.160000::So let's do a bunch of different versions.
0:36:51.160000 - 0:36:53.440000::Let's make me British for one fucking line
0:36:53.440000 - 0:36:54.960000::and see how that works.
0:36:54.960000 - 0:36:56.840000::But you gotta understand that we're on a budget here.
0:36:56.840000 - 0:36:57.680000::We got time.
0:36:57.680000 - 0:36:59.920000::We got this filmmaking is not a slow business.
0:36:59.920000 - 0:37:01.760000::So we don't have all time to fucking sit around and wait
0:37:01.760000 - 0:37:03.600000::for the actor to do this and that and this and that.
0:37:03.600000 - 0:37:05.440000::Because we only have so much time for these grips
0:37:05.440000 - 0:37:08.440000::as hands start falling off with the rear wrists.
0:37:08.440000 - 0:37:09.280000::So we got to move.
0:37:09.280000 - 0:37:10.560000::You got to come in ready to go.
0:37:10.560000 - 0:37:12.840000::You do that shit in rehearsal or you don't do rehearsal.
0:37:12.840000 - 0:37:13.680000::Yeah.
0:37:13.680000 - 0:37:15.480000::When I'm directing, I'll tell the fucking person,
0:37:15.480000 - 0:37:17.560000::you better do this line read this way.
0:37:17.560000 - 0:37:20.760000::Or I'm about this close from fucking any mercy in this shit
0:37:20.760000 - 0:37:23.880000::and put myself big mama's house where or fuck wait.
0:37:24.120000 - 0:37:26.400000::What is the one where he's like all plays
0:37:26.400000 - 0:37:28.080000::all these different characters in it?
0:37:28.080000 - 0:37:29.400000::The clumps.
0:37:29.400000 - 0:37:31.360000::Oh, the thing to make the clumps.
0:37:31.360000 - 0:37:33.880000::Yeah, just put myself in every different character.
0:37:33.880000 - 0:37:34.880000::I know you gotta do that.
0:37:34.880000 - 0:37:35.800000::I'll be you.
0:37:35.800000 - 0:37:36.640000::You know what I'm saying?
0:37:36.640000 - 0:37:38.400000::If you don't do this, you're right.
0:37:38.400000 - 0:37:41.080000::Well, dude, this is my take on this shit because
0:37:41.080000 - 0:37:43.080000::what you have to do is the way that you have,
0:37:43.080000 - 0:37:45.320000::the way that a musician has perfect pitch,
0:37:45.320000 - 0:37:47.320000::you need to have perfect emotional pitch.
0:37:47.320000 - 0:37:50.160000::Because anybody can hold the longer you hold the note
0:37:50.160000 - 0:37:52.120000::the easier it is for it to sound good, right?
0:37:52.120000 - 0:37:59.120000::You can go into your vibrato and then when you're in the vibrato.
0:38:02.280000 - 0:38:06.080000::But it's harder to do a straight no.
0:38:06.080000 - 0:38:10.920000::And you have to know G, C, E, A, A, you have to know,
0:38:10.920000 - 0:38:13.600000::I'm gonna hit the emotion of sadness in one line.
0:38:13.600000 - 0:38:16.480000::You don't have a whole monologue to settle into it.
0:38:16.480000 - 0:38:18::Action's going on all around you.
0:38:18 - 0:38:21.080000::And you need to be able to be one with the composition
0:38:21.080000 - 0:38:22.080000::of the scene.
0:38:22.080000 - 0:38:24.600000::And when your note comes, you're just part of the choir.
0:38:24.600000 - 0:38:25.360000::No.
0:38:27.360000 - 0:38:29.440000::Can we do a harmonization right now?

0:45:21.480000 - 0:45:26.640000::present to the public and there's a version of ourselves that we want you to think is
0:45:26.640000 - 0:45:27.920000::real.
0:45:28.920000 - 0:45:33.240000::A lot of times, most of our life is perpetuating these false images.
0:45:33.240000 - 0:45:44.240000::And I think I've just had enough of acting like Eric is someone that he's not, you know?
0:45:44.240000 - 0:45:48.240000::And I think it's time for the truth to come out that he's just a wretched, disgusting,
0:45:48.240000 - 0:45:50.160000::smelly fucking piece of shit.
0:45:50.160000 - 0:45:51.920000::Fucking piece of shit bastard.
0:45:51.920000 - 0:45:53.160000::Just look at him right now.
0:45:53.160000 - 0:45:57::He's acting like fucking Batman just because he went and got food.
0:45:57 - 0:46:03.840000::But yeah, if you're just, you're just turning right now.
0:46:03.840000 - 0:46:04.840000::What's up, dude?
0:46:04.840000 - 0:46:06.840000::We've been, oh, hey, Eric, what's up?
0:46:06.840000 - 0:46:10.200000::Eric, we were just talking about your accolades.
0:46:10.200000 - 0:46:11.840000::We were just talking about how did it go?
0:46:11.840000 - 0:46:12.840000::Oh, good man.
0:46:12.840000 - 0:46:13.840000::Awesome, man.
0:46:13.840000 - 0:46:14.840000::Thanks for coming back.
0:46:14.840000 - 0:46:15.840000::Yeah, I'm a little bit comfortable.
0:46:15.840000 - 0:46:20.440000::We are around you when we're not recording.
0:46:20.440000 - 0:46:22.120000::But anyways, yeah, man.
0:46:22.120000 - 0:46:24.240000::So you're gonna have a world, dude.
0:46:24.240000 - 0:46:25.920000::You're gonna have Charlie Chaplin eyebrows.
0:46:26.920000 - 0:46:28.920000::Whoa, damn.
0:46:28.920000 - 0:46:30.920000::Are you excited to have that explosive?
0:46:30.920000 - 0:46:32.920000::It's so expressive.
0:46:32.920000 - 0:46:34.280000::Makes it harder to have that enchilade.
0:46:34.280000 - 0:46:37.280000::Yeah, I am.
0:46:37.280000 - 0:46:38.280000::Let me guess.
0:46:38.280000 - 0:46:44.520000::You tipped the delivery person $0 and kind of banged on their car and shook it.
0:46:44.520000 - 0:46:45.520000::What the fuck?
0:46:45.520000 - 0:46:47.360000::Hey, go quicker.
0:46:47.360000 - 0:46:55.880000::They left it on the, on the, a little table by reception guy.
0:46:55.880000 - 0:46:57.480000::Yes, picked it up.
0:46:57.480000 - 0:46:58.480000::Wow, easy.
0:46:58.480000 - 0:47:00.720000::Did you all watch SpongeBob much?
0:47:00.720000 - 0:47:01.720000::Of course.
0:47:01.720000 - 0:47:02.480000::Yep.
0:47:02.480000 - 0:47:06.400000::We went out on SpongeBob yesterday recording.
0:47:06.400000 - 0:47:08.680000::We did?
0:47:08.680000 - 0:47:10.560000::Everyone's talking about the one where a squid roller,
0:47:10.560000 - 0:47:11.560000::fucking overtaken.
0:47:11.560000 - 0:47:12.560000::That was fun.
0:47:12.560000 - 0:47:13.720000::Yeah, fun about this.
0:47:13.720000 - 0:47:15.520000::I remember this.
0:47:15.520000 - 0:47:19.160000::Still no pickles.
0:47:19.160000 - 0:47:20.040000::Dude, what'd you say?
0:47:20.040000 - 0:47:20.960000::Dailedo pickles.
0:47:21.960000 - 0:47:24.960000::What'd you say?
0:47:24.960000 - 0:47:26.960000::Dailedo pickles.
0:47:26.960000 - 0:47:27.960000::Piggles.
0:47:27.960000 - 0:47:28.960000::No.
0:47:28.960000 - 0:47:32.960000::You guys are not, still no pickles.
0:47:32.960000 - 0:47:34.960000::Still no pickles.
0:47:34.960000 - 0:47:35.960000::No, you, I can't.
0:47:35.960000 - 0:47:37.960000::Oh, that's the fucking pickle.
0:47:37.960000 - 0:47:38.960000::Pickle guy.
0:47:38.960000 - 0:47:41.960000::You can't get into SpongeBob, dude.
0:47:41.960000 - 0:47:44.440000::You remember plankton song,
0:47:44.440000 - 0:47:46.960000::F-Aid for friends that do stuff together.
0:47:46.960000 - 0:47:48.960000::You is for me and me.
0:47:48.960000 - 0:47:49.960000::What is he spelling out?
0:47:49.960000 - 0:47:51.960000::I forget with his phone.
0:47:51.960000 - 0:47:52.960000::Fun.
0:47:52.960000 - 0:47:55.960000::He needs for three letters.
0:47:55.960000 - 0:47:57.960000::What does he spelling out?
0:47:57.960000 - 0:47:59.960000::And then one of them's like bombs.
0:47:59.960000 - 0:48:00.960000::Emma is for Bob.
0:48:00.960000 - 0:48:02.960000::Be your mom's.
0:48:02.960000 - 0:48:03.960000::Remember that?
0:48:03.960000 - 0:48:07.960000::This sounds like you're fucking 97 trying to remember.
0:48:07.960000 - 0:48:09.960000::And I have the swing.
0:48:09.960000 - 0:48:11.960000::I have an Alzheimer's type memory.
0:48:11.960000 - 0:48:13.960000::Like, I think I'll legitimately.
0:48:13.960000 - 0:48:15.960000::Honestly, thank God.
0:48:15.960000 - 0:48:17.960000::Because if I was the only one.
0:48:17.960000 - 0:48:20.960000::I would have to remember you remember something from 2015.
0:48:20.960000 - 0:48:22.960000::You can't remember it, but then I'll have to play
0:48:22.960000 - 0:48:23.960000::fucking Fetty Wop.
0:48:23.960000 - 0:48:24.960000::Whatever.
0:48:24.960000 - 0:48:26.960000::And you go right back into being like,
0:48:26.960000 - 0:48:28.960000::what I was like in 2015.
0:48:28.960000 - 0:48:29.960000::It's like a time machine.
0:48:29.960000 - 0:48:30.960000::Oh my God.
0:48:30.960000 - 0:48:32.960000::The fucking Fetty Wop.
0:48:32.960000 - 0:48:33.960000::Yeah.
0:48:33.960000 - 0:48:34.960000::Oh.
0:48:34.960000 - 0:48:35.960000::That's what it is.
0:48:35.960000 - 0:48:36.960000::That's the Fetty Wop.
0:48:36.960000 - 0:48:37.960000::Yeah.
0:48:37.960000 - 0:48:38.960000::Oh.
0:48:38.960000 - 0:48:39.960000::That's what it is.
0:48:39.960000 - 0:48:40.960000::That's the Fetty Wop.
0:48:40.960000 - 0:48:43.960000::I'm like, hey, what's up, Pimmo.
0:48:43.960000 - 0:48:45.960000::One, two, three, four, five.
0:48:45.960000 - 0:48:47.960000::Did you know that he grew his eye back?
0:48:47.960000 - 0:48:49.960000::He grew it back.
0:48:49.960000 - 0:48:50.960000::Hey, man.
0:48:50.960000 - 0:48:51.960000::No, he didn't.
0:48:51.960000 - 0:48:52.960000::Stop talking about.
0:48:52.960000 - 0:48:53.960000::No, he didn't.
0:48:53.960000 - 0:48:55.960000::Oh, well, that's because his baby eyes finally fell out.
0:48:55.960000 - 0:48:56.960000::Imagine that.
0:48:56.960000 - 0:48:57.960000::Exactly.
0:48:57.960000 - 0:48:58.960000::The baby eyes.
0:48:58.960000 - 0:48:59.960000::Wow.
0:48:59.960000 - 0:49:01.960000::That sounds like a Jack Benzinger video.
0:49:01.960000 - 0:49:03.960000::Fetty Wop grew his eyeball.
0:49:03.960000 - 0:49:09.960000::I want us to be fucking the first to do intensive stem cell research.
0:49:09.960000 - 0:49:10.960000::Human stem cells.
0:49:10.960000 - 0:49:11.960000::I want to be taken.
0:49:11.960000 - 0:49:12.960000::I want to be fucking drinking stem cells.
0:49:12.960000 - 0:49:14.960000::Like, you can't imagine.
0:49:14.960000 - 0:49:15.960000::Oh, okay.
0:49:15.960000 - 0:49:16.960000::I want to.
0:49:16.960000 - 0:49:19.960000::Because if you just threw a bunch of stem cells in the eye, I guess what the body knows to make
0:49:19.960000 - 0:49:20.960000::that eye.
0:49:20.960000 - 0:49:21.960000::Okay.
0:49:21.960000 - 0:49:23.960000::If you're missing an eye, you threw it in the hole.
0:49:23.960000 - 0:49:26.960000::So how that body grows an eye?
0:49:26.960000 - 0:49:28.960000::I think it will eventually.
0:49:28.960000 - 0:49:29.960000::I don't know.
0:49:29.960000 - 0:49:31.960000::Doesn't it come from children?
0:49:31.960000 - 0:49:32.960000::G.S.
0:49:32.960000 - 0:49:33.960000::Children.
0:49:33.960000 - 0:49:34.960000::Children.
0:49:34.960000 - 0:49:36.960000::No, it comes from babies.
0:49:36.960000 - 0:49:37.960000::Baby.
0:49:37.960000 - 0:49:38.960000::Really?
0:49:38.960000 - 0:49:43.960000::I, and by the way, by the time this comes out, this baby that I made yesterday might be
0:49:43.960000 - 0:49:46.960000::about three, four, five, six, seven, eight years old.
0:49:46.960000 - 0:49:48.960000::But I met a baby yesterday.
0:49:48.960000 - 0:49:50.960000::Or this, your name is Mara.
0:49:50.960000 - 0:49:52.960000::And it's Ben Briggs's child.
0:49:52.960000 - 0:49:56.960000::Ben Briggs has come up quite a bit.
0:49:56.960000 - 0:49:58.960000::I keep bringing Ben up.
0:49:58.960000 - 0:49:59.960000::Ben's a close friend.

0:50:00 - 0:50:02.800000::And you know, so but meeting this baby, I'll tell you what
0:50:03.880000 - 0:50:09.720000::you see this creature that is just so fresh to life and it's everything is new.
0:50:10.040000 - 0:50:12.600000::There is music playing. I'm like, you never fucking heard music like this.
0:50:12.600000 - 0:50:16.760000::I know you never heard a guitar before, you know, your first time hearing guitar.
0:50:17.200000 - 0:50:20.040000::So cool seeing that something processed this stuff for the first time.
0:50:20.040000 - 0:50:21.080000::You know what I mean?
0:50:21.400000 - 0:50:23.600000::Yeah, yeah. It's incredible.
0:50:24.080000 - 0:50:28.080000::So should we say what gave us joy?
0:50:28.080000 - 0:50:30.760000::Yeah, let's do it.
0:50:31.520000 - 0:50:36.560000::Should we? Here's what gave me joy walking downstairs in my little clogs,
0:50:37.760000 - 0:50:41.420000::picking up the fucking enchilada, walking back in, opening the door and it smelled like a
0:50:41.420000 - 0:50:46.440000::fucking hotel in a way where what why do these places have a distinct smell?
0:50:46.800000 - 0:50:50.840000::It could be a different chain of hotels, whatever they all smell the same.
0:50:51.080000 - 0:50:52.280000::You know what I mean? What is that?
0:50:53.120000 - 0:50:55.400000::That's God. Yeah, that's God.
0:50:55.880000 - 0:50:57.680000::That's God. That's divine.
0:50:58.640000 - 0:51:01.080000::I know. So what gave you guys joy?
0:51:01.320000 - 0:51:07.120000::I'll say what gave me joy was I think this is one of the most addictive snacks on the planet and I mean.
0:51:08.920000 - 0:51:10.880000::It's chocolate covered pretzels, man.
0:51:10.880000 - 0:51:15.120000::Like those things have a hold on blue ones. The ones in the blue bag.
0:51:15.880000 - 0:51:17::They're traded Joe style.
0:51:17 - 0:51:21.800000::Mill, Mill, Mill, Mill, Mill, Mill, Mill, Mill, Mill, Mill, Mill, Mill,
0:51:21.960000 - 0:51:23.480000::put some extra milk on those.
0:51:26.680000 - 0:51:28.880000::I want my milk chocolate to be mostly milk.
0:51:29.160000 - 0:51:29.680000::I'm listening.
0:51:30.480000 - 0:51:33.880000::But yeah, I've been eating the fuck out of those and they're addictive as fuck.
0:51:33.880000 - 0:51:35.600000::And put a little bit of butter with them.
0:51:36.360000 - 0:51:39.200000::Oh, you're you're you are the devil.
0:51:39.200000 - 0:51:40.920000::Erick the calorie fucking king.
0:51:40.920000 - 0:51:42.960000::You're the devil on the show on the side of my shoulder.
0:51:43.600000 - 0:51:45.080000::The devil in the details, man.
0:51:45.440000 - 0:51:46.120000::And Jack.
0:51:47.520000 - 0:51:49.040000::Well, what gave you joy, dude?
0:51:49.320000 - 0:51:59.240000::What gave me joy is I've been getting into back into playing music because I just I just tried
0:51:59.240000 - 0:52:04.840000::playing my piano song and my ukulele song and I was like, uh, oh, I can't lose these things.
0:52:05.440000 - 0:52:10.800000::So I've been trying to make that a part of my morning routine is to practice playing my songs.
0:52:13.320000 - 0:52:13.920000::That's amazing.
0:52:13.920000 - 0:52:14.600000::That's wonderful.
0:52:14.600000 - 0:52:15.920000::Dude, you're like a putter.
0:52:16.880000 - 0:52:20.200000::You're like way better at music than I thought you were when I heard you.
0:52:20.200000 - 0:52:23.920000::I kind of I kind of like took a I don't think I'd heard you play something
0:52:23.920000 - 0:52:27.160000::besides the ukulele in a while and I was like, damn, Jack.
0:52:27.160000 - 0:52:30.080000::Like you really like it is shocking.
0:52:30.080000 - 0:52:37.480000::You really can play like and I think there's nothing that is sexier than holding with holding a skill.
0:52:38.200000 - 0:52:42::You know, I'm saying then all of a sudden you're just like, oh shit, like you can fucking do a backflip.
0:52:42 - 0:52:42.640000::What the fuck?
0:52:42.640000 - 0:52:43.720000::You know, I never knew that.
0:52:44.720000 - 0:52:48.200000::And the longer you withhold it, the sexier that little trick becomes.
0:52:48.200000 - 0:52:49.720000::Can you hear this?
0:52:49.720000 - 0:52:50.720000::Yes, hit it.
0:53:05.720000 - 0:53:06.720000::Oh my god.
