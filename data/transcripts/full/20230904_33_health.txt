0:01:24.840000 - 0:01:28.720000::And I think I even mentioned that I finally understood what it was like for people.
0:01:29.240000 - 0:01:32.680000::Or I admitted I couldn't believe what life would be like for someone who's
0:01:32.680000 - 0:01:35.280000::chronically ill, because that's insane to be sick that long.
0:01:35.640000 - 0:01:37.840000::Well, I recover.

0:03:05.480000 - 0:03:06.400000::You let go.
0:03:06.400000 - 0:03:11.840000::You stop struggling and you let go and you become one with the sickness because your
0:03:11.840000 - 0:03:13.880000::body, sickness is just spent.
0:03:14.120000 - 0:03:15.320000::Fuck, I'm sick.

0:03:27.560000 - 0:03:28.160000::Question.
0:03:28.360000 - 0:03:29.360000::Is this part of that?
0:03:29.640000 - 0:03:33.760000::You know when you're sick and your skin is all sensitive and your muscles are
0:03:33.760000 - 0:03:37.120000::achy and it's you're in bed at about 2 a.m.
0:03:37.120000 - 0:03:41.160000::You wake up and maybe the AC's on and you start going like this.
0:03:44 - 0:03:45::You just none it, man.
0:03:47.160000 - 0:03:48.160000::Yeah.
0:03:48.160000 - 0:03:50.840000::Yeah, I guess that maybe that's it.
0:03:50.960000 - 0:03:51.720000::Maybe that's it.
0:03:53.400000 - 0:03:54.520000::Are you talking about shivering?
0:03:55.120000 - 0:03:56.200000::It's but it's not.
0:03:56.760000 - 0:04:00.280000::I guess that is what shivering is, but that noise is so bizarre, right?
0:04:01.680000 - 0:04:03.080000::Makes you feel so much better.
0:04:05.200000 - 0:04:06.200000::You guys have ever done this?
0:04:06.200000 - 0:04:07.240000::Noise is out.
0:04:07.240000 - 0:04:08.360000::No, I don't.
0:04:08.440000 - 0:04:14.360000::I usually just bottle it in and I'll tense my entire body like instead of
0:04:15 - 0:04:15.920000::instead of letting it out.
0:04:16.920000 - 0:04:19::Because that's what that's how you get rid of a sickness, right?
0:04:19 - 0:04:24.400000::Is you have to make your body as inhospitable as possible for the germs, et cetera.
0:04:24.760000 - 0:04:24.960000::Right.
0:04:24.960000 - 0:04:29.440000::So what you do that by getting your body too hot or making your body too loud or making
0:04:29.440000 - 0:04:33.800000::your body too small, you know, just areas that germs don't thrive in.
0:04:35 - 0:04:36.320000::You're bringing pots and pans.
0:04:36.600000 - 0:04:36.920000::Yeah.
0:04:36.920000 - 0:04:37.880000::You're saying pots and pans.

0:04:39.680000 - 0:04:41.400000::You're just being in a bad mood.
0:04:42.280000 - 0:04:46.520000::I'm always in a that's that's what makes me so endearing is when I'm sick.
0:04:46.520000 - 0:04:48.760000::I become like a little sweet.
0:04:48.760000 - 0:04:50.280000::I'm so fucking nice.
0:04:50.280000 - 0:04:52.480000::I'm like, please don't worry.

0:04:56.240000 - 0:04:59.240000::I'm so people pity me in a way that

0:10:01.720000 - 0:10:02.560000::Should I take this or that?
0:10:02.560000 - 0:10:05.120000::He was like, you know what we call some of these medicines?
0:10:05.120000 - 0:10:07.320000::Like Benadrill might help you feel better.
0:10:07.320000 - 0:10:08.680000::It might make you sleepy.
0:10:08.680000 - 0:10:11.680000::But the biggest thing it'll do is it'll like make you think
0:10:11.680000 - 0:10:13.480000::that you're doing something for it.
0:10:13.480000 - 0:10:16.840000::Because like, he's like, the most of medicine is entertaining you
0:10:16.840000 - 0:10:18.840000::while your body does the work.
0:10:18.840000 - 0:10:19.680000::Mm.
0:10:19.680000 - 0:10:20.680000::And it's amazing.

0:10:21.840000 - 0:10:23.640000::What do you mean like fun?
0:10:23.640000 - 0:10:25.040000::No, just like distracting you.
0:10:25.040000 - 0:10:26.760000::Like, oh, like it puts you to sleep a little bit.
0:10:26.760000 - 0:10:28.440000::Let's make you feel better, and yeah, there you go.
0:10:28.440000 - 0:10:29.840000::I guess that makes you feel better.
0:10:29.840000 - 0:10:32.400000::Because it puts you to sleep, but it's not, you know,
0:10:32.400000 - 0:10:33.760000::what I mean, it's not attacking them.
0:10:33.760000 - 0:10:37.520000::I mean, sickness is a mental game, but it's really what it is.
0:10:37.520000 - 0:10:39.120000::It's a physical game.
0:10:39.120000 - 0:10:41.440000::Your body is doing all this physical work.
0:10:41.440000 - 0:10:44.640000::And you have to keep your mind sane during this time.
0:10:44.640000 - 0:10:47.040000::And it's this, there's, that's what I'm saying.
0:10:47.040000 - 0:10:49.520000::You got to become one with the sickness in your brain.
0:10:49.520000 - 0:10:51.560000::Down, in your mental state.
0:10:51.560000 - 0:10:52.400000::So what do you got?
0:10:52.400000 - 0:10:54.200000::I fucking, sometimes here's the thing though.
0:10:54.200000 - 0:10:57.160000::This is the dark, sighted part of me, OK?
0:10:57.160000 - 0:10:58.880000::When I get, they write a amount of sick,
0:10:58.880000 - 0:11:03.600000::which is frankly right now, where I can't really go do stuff, OK?
0:11:03.600000 - 0:11:07.440000::But I am at home and I'm like, I'm not body to the point
0:11:07.440000 - 0:11:08.360000::where I'm sleeping all day.
0:11:08.360000 - 0:11:12.160000::I can watch TV, I can read books, I can play about games,
0:11:12.160000 - 0:11:14.200000::I can eat food.

0:11:19.680000 - 0:11:22.280000::at home vacation where you're a little sick and you're a baby
0:11:22.280000 - 0:11:25.400000::for a little while, you know, you know, COVID lockdowns.
0:11:25.400000 - 0:11:29.200000::And I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm devouring content right now.
0:11:29.200000 - 0:11:33.080000::And I would say it's the most cringe of all content, OK?
0:11:33.080000 - 0:11:36::The family of content that it is, it's bad.
0:11:36 - 0:11:36.800000::It's what he watching.
0:11:36.800000 - 0:11:37.800000::What are you watching?
0:11:37.800000 - 0:11:42.600000::Watching the BBC, Narnia, many TV,
0:11:42.600000 - 0:11:44.360000::many series from 1988.
0:11:44.360000 - 0:11:46.440000::Have you guys ever seen this?
0:11:46.440000 - 0:11:47.280000::No, I wouldn't.
0:11:47.280000 - 0:11:50.080000::Maybe I've seen like clips of it.
0:11:50.080000 - 0:11:51.520000::It's like the most busted.
0:11:51.520000 - 0:11:55.080000::It's the most low budget like Jack, you know, Narnia is the line.
0:11:55.080000 - 0:11:56.440000::That's inside of a closet.
0:11:56.440000 - 0:11:57.360000::Yeah.
0:11:57.360000 - 0:12:00.920000::That's a snowy landscape inside of a closet.
0:12:00.920000 - 0:12:01.800000::Yeah, that's it.
0:12:01.800000 - 0:12:03::That's part of it.
0:12:03 - 0:12:04.200000::Yeah.
0:12:04.200000 - 0:12:07.400000::There's a river in the white witch.
0:12:07.400000 - 0:12:09.080000::But I'm watching.
0:12:09.080000 - 0:12:10.800000::I've watched hours of this shit.
0:12:10.800000 - 0:12:12.480000::Just, and I watched it when I was a kid,
0:12:12.480000 - 0:12:16.440000::we picked up the big DVD pack from Costco and I just devoured it then.
0:12:16.440000 - 0:12:17.760000::And I'm devouring it now again.
0:12:17.760000 - 0:12:18.560000::Why is that?
0:12:18.560000 - 0:12:21::I'm returning to what made me happy as a child.
0:12:21 - 0:12:22.640000::Reverting comfort.
0:12:22.640000 - 0:12:23.560000::Seeking shelter.
0:12:23.560000 - 0:12:25.280000::You're entering the mental womb.
0:12:25.280000 - 0:12:26.960000::They didn't have CGI budgets.
0:12:26.960000 - 0:12:29.840000::So they drew in all the whore, all the fucking creatures.
0:12:29.840000 - 0:12:31.840000::They're all, it's all pencil.
0:12:31.840000 - 0:12:32.760000::And they didn't pay them.
0:12:32.760000 - 0:12:33.760000::They didn't pay the puzzle.
0:12:33.760000 - 0:12:35.680000::I think that's why I like watching a clip of it.
0:12:35.680000 - 0:12:38.480000::Because like the special effects are like so bad.
0:12:38.480000 - 0:12:39.640000::They are busted.
0:12:39.640000 - 0:12:41.320000::But I like those old stuff.
0:12:41.320000 - 0:12:43.680000::I would rather watch this shit a million times over
0:12:43.680000 - 0:12:46.200000::than some CGI nightmare.
0:12:46.200000 - 0:12:47.720000::Right.
0:12:47.720000 - 0:12:49.320000::Well, the thing is.
0:12:49.320000 - 0:12:50.760000::Yeah.
0:12:50.760000 - 0:12:51.760000::Go ahead.
0:12:51.760000 - 0:12:56.800000::We'll just with the new CGI, it's, people are missing the point of story time a little
0:12:56.800000 - 0:13:03.120000::bit, which is to create and inspire and help somebody experience something magical.
0:13:03.120000 - 0:13:07.960000::And not just be like, look at how cheap we could make it as realistic as possible.
0:13:07.960000 - 0:13:10.240000::That's, we're getting farther and farther away from artistry.
0:13:10.240000 - 0:13:12.760000::That's all I like to say.
0:13:12.760000 - 0:13:13.760000::We predicted this.
0:13:13.760000 - 0:13:15.880000::We suspected this years ago that this would happen.
0:13:15.880000 - 0:13:20.320000::Also, remember we were sitting down in Chicago like CGI is going to fucking end.
0:13:20.320000 - 0:13:22.560000::It's all true expression.
0:13:22.560000 - 0:13:23.560000::It's game over.
0:13:23.560000 - 0:13:24.560000::It's game over.
0:13:24.560000 - 0:13:29.560000::But no, the practical, like everybody in this, like the animals talk in this world.
0:13:29.560000 - 0:13:34.200000::So there's beavers and badgers and line, the Aslan line.
0:13:34.200000 - 0:13:37.040000::And they're all like people dressed up.
0:13:37.040000 - 0:13:41.480000::There's like people in Aslan.
0:13:41.480000 - 0:13:47.800000::There's like little people in it as all sorts of creatures.
0:13:47.800000 - 0:13:51.640000::But I frankly bring this type of movie making back now.
0:13:51.640000 - 0:13:53.880000::Should we make a joy tactics, Narnia?
0:13:53.880000 - 0:13:54.880000::Us three.
0:13:54.880000 - 0:13:58.520000::Oh, special flaws in the podcast with the journal.

0:20:02.840000 - 0:20:05.340000::I think they were kind of around the...
0:20:05.340000 - 0:20:06.480000::I think they were like...
0:20:06.480000 - 0:20:08.480000::...collabbing, you know, there was no...
0:20:08.480000 - 0:20:09.920000::Right, let me get on the track.

0:20:30 - 0:20:32::The way... I mean...
0:20:32 - 0:20:34.320000::He's kind of getting more like dead.

0:21:08.800000 - 0:21:11.760000::But I was gonna say it was like what Ryan Dunne would look like right now if he was still alive.
0:21:13.680000 - 0:21:14.480000::Rest in peace.
0:21:14.480000 - 0:21:17.360000::The last movie that Tom Hulse was in was...
0:21:17.360000 - 0:21:19.680000::Do you remember the movie Jumper?
0:21:19.680000 - 0:21:21.040000::In 2008.
0:21:21.040000 - 0:21:21.840000::No.
0:21:21.840000 - 0:21:22.560000::Jumper.
0:21:22.560000 - 0:21:24.080000::With Hayden Christensen,
0:21:24.080000 - 0:21:27.520000::and he basically has a skill where he can...
0:21:27.520000 - 0:21:28.560000::He didn't Christensen.
0:21:28.640000 - 0:21:29.840000::He can teleport around the world.
0:21:31.520000 - 0:21:32.640000::And I remember when I went to...
0:21:32.640000 - 0:21:34.480000::Oh yeah, yeah, I remember that.
0:21:34.480000 - 0:21:38.320000::I went inside this movie with my friend's older brother who...
0:21:40.320000 - 0:21:41.280000::was addicted to meth.
0:21:42.160000 - 0:21:46.800000::But was in recovery, but I think I actually was back in the Throes of Addiction,
0:21:46.800000 - 0:21:50.480000::and he was driving us to the theater in his Honda Civic,
0:21:50.480000 - 0:21:51.680000::going so fucking...
0:21:51.680000 - 0:21:53.120000::He had a roll bar in his car.
0:21:53.680000 - 0:21:54.800000::Blasting music.
0:21:54.800000 - 0:21:56.080000::So fucking loud.
0:21:56.400000 - 0:21:57.360000::Ffff.
0:21:57.360000 - 0:21:58.960000::Going crazy in the car.
0:21:59.680000 - 0:22:01.920000::And I remember being so scared for my life.
0:22:01.920000 - 0:22:03.920000::And the whole time at the movie I could barely watch movie,
0:22:03.920000 - 0:22:08.560000::I just thought I have to ride fucking back to my friend's house in this fucking car.
0:22:08.560000 - 0:22:09.200000::I'm gonna die.
0:22:10.800000 - 0:22:11.600000::And you could have.
0:22:12.400000 - 0:22:13.920000::And I could have died, man.
0:22:13.920000 - 0:22:16.080000::That's what the fucking makes me emotional, man.
0:22:16.080000 - 0:22:17.120000::You could have killed him.
0:22:19.360000 - 0:22:22.800000::Have you guys ever been in a car with somebody who was like wasted?
0:22:22.800000 - 0:22:23.840000::Like, of course.
0:22:23.840000 - 0:22:24.800000::We all have been.
0:22:24.960000 - 0:22:25.920000::Eric Rio.
0:22:28.640000 - 0:22:31.200000::No, but we all have been in someone's car.
0:22:31.200000 - 0:22:33.200000::Like, I'm talking about like fucked up.
0:22:33.200000 - 0:22:34.400000::Like, I don't know.
0:22:34.400000 - 0:22:35.200000::You don't remember.
0:22:35.200000 - 0:22:35.840000::Work out.
0:22:35.840000 - 0:22:36.640000::You don't remember.
0:22:38.160000 - 0:22:39.440000::Wait, are we talking about that last time?
0:22:39.440000 - 0:22:43.440000::Yeah, I don't want to say anything more, but we've all been in someone's car.
0:22:43.440000 - 0:22:44.400000::That was fun, man.
0:22:44.400000 - 0:22:45.600000::I think it did this happen.
0:22:45.600000 - 0:22:46.880000::Because it didn't end badly.
0:22:46.880000 - 0:22:47.520000::But you know what?
0:22:47.520000 - 0:22:50.400000::In that moment, I remember this car rider for talking about the same one.
0:22:50.400000 - 0:22:51.280000::And I remember thinking,
0:22:51.280000 - 0:22:53.440000::this would be the sickest way to die right now.
0:22:53.440000 - 0:22:54.080000::I don't get fucked.
0:22:54.080000 - 0:22:55.040000::This is fun.
0:22:55.040000 - 0:22:55.840000::You know what I mean?
0:22:55.840000 - 0:23:02.960000::Wasn't that after, well, well, when I was a kid, I was in a, like,
0:23:02.960000 - 0:23:05.360000::my friend's dad got fucking hammered.
0:23:05.360000 - 0:23:05.840000::No.
0:23:05.840000 - 0:23:10.960000::drove us to dinner to a, all you can eat Chinese buffet.
0:23:10.960000 - 0:23:11.920000::Oh, yeah.
0:23:11.920000 - 0:23:15.840000::He was like fucking like wasted.
0:23:15.840000 - 0:23:20.720000::Like, I'm talking about like drink like, like 10, 15 beers.
0:23:20.720000 - 0:23:22.160000::And was like, come on, let's go.
0:23:22.240000 - 0:23:25.440000::And he like fucking we were, we would go to this Chinese buffet.
0:23:25.440000 - 0:23:29.680000::And you know, the hack, when you're broke is you go there and you eat the,
0:23:29.680000 - 0:23:35.280000::the crab legs, because you pay like, you know, 15 bucks or whatever to get the buffet.
0:23:35.280000 - 0:23:39.040000::But then the crab legs are just worth it in and of itself,
0:23:39.040000 - 0:23:41.600000::because those, but they're probably the worst crab legs.
0:23:41.600000 - 0:23:42.800000::Crab legs, crab legs.
0:23:42.800000 - 0:23:45.040000::The worst grade crab legs on planet Earth.
0:23:45.040000 - 0:23:46::No question.
0:23:46 - 0:23:47.520000::Oh, crab is a crab.
0:23:47.520000 - 0:23:50.240000::You know, not these crabs, dude.
0:23:50.240000 - 0:23:56.080000::These, these crabs are from like the, where global warming is already heated up the ocean way to
0:23:56.080000 - 0:23:58::cut. So they're precooked.
0:23:58.720000 - 0:24:00.480000::They're pretty lukewarm.
0:24:00.480000 - 0:24:01.440000::They got a phrasum.
0:24:02.800000 - 0:24:03.120000::Good.
0:24:04.320000 - 0:24:05.360000::Wait, oh, I,
0:24:08.400000 - 0:24:08.880000::what?
0:24:08.880000 - 0:24:10.880000::I have a bad last memory of a relative.
0:24:12.320000 - 0:24:13.920000::It was at the old country buffet.
0:24:15.280000 - 0:24:17.360000::Do you guys, do you guys have those where you grow?
0:24:17.360000 - 0:24:18.160000::Oh, yeah.
0:24:18.160000 - 0:24:20.320000::Wait, go there all the fucking time.
0:24:20.320000 - 0:24:23.600000::The one with the store on the, no cracker barrel.
0:24:23.600000 - 0:24:24.720000::I'm thinking the cracker barrel.
0:24:24.720000 - 0:24:27.280000::This is called, maybe this was just in my neck of the woods,
0:24:27.920000 - 0:24:30.080000::but it was called the old country buffet.
0:24:30.080000 - 0:24:35.200000::And as a kid, even, I remember thinking by age 10, I was like, I've been going there since I was
0:24:35.200000 - 0:24:38.320000::really young and I was like, this place is going fucking downhill.
0:24:38.320000 - 0:24:40.160000::I can tell as a child.
0:24:41.040000 - 0:24:44.320000::And we're sitting there most busted food of all time.
0:24:44.320000 - 0:24:45.520000::And I'm sitting there watching.
0:24:46.160000 - 0:24:48.560000::I'll just say it was my grandfather.
0:24:48.560000 - 0:24:51.680000::And he's sitting there and he's eating his salad.
0:24:51.680000 - 0:24:54.640000::And there's ranch on this, all over the salad.
0:24:54.640000 - 0:24:57.520000::And it's like getting in the corners of his mouth.
0:24:57.520000 - 0:24:59.760000::And I was like dribbling down the side of the road.

0:25:00 - 0:25:06.880000::his met and I just was thinking how cruel is God to make us age like this? How cruel is a creator to
0:25:06.880000 - 0:25:12.240000::let us end up unable to wipe our mouths like that and not know about the ranch on our faces?
0:25:13.120000 - 0:25:18.160000::You know what I mean? Fucking circle of life. It's just me. Man, you know what you mean?
0:25:18.160000 - 0:25:22.640000::That was the whole country but phase fault for fucking up that ranch making it to watery.
0:25:22.640000 - 0:25:27.360000::To watery, yeah. Good, galley. I just was at one of the worst restaurants I've ever been to.
0:25:27.920000 - 0:25:35.040000::It felt like worse than Sharkey's Cantina. Yes, it was. It was worse than Sharkey's Cantina.
0:25:35.040000 - 0:25:41.040000::This was full kitchen nightmare. Like I would say the vibe in there was it felt like I was at an
0:25:41.040000 - 0:25:48::abusive end of life facility and this is what they feed people. This is what the ambiance is.
0:25:48 - 0:25:54.320000::This is what the clientele are. It was out in cold spring, New York a little bit up the way.
0:25:54.320000 - 0:26:01.040000::Session. No, it was just you know, it was just like an American fair like restaurant in like a
0:26:01.040000 - 0:26:09.120000::inn you know what I'm saying right on the Hudson and let's just say we got a Caesar salad and it had
0:26:09.120000 - 0:26:14.880000::a bunch of plastic in it and so we did they took that off the bill because it had plastic.
0:26:14.880000 - 0:26:21.200000::What's up with plastic? It looked like maybe you ever get like pre-cooked rice that comes in like a
0:26:21.200000 - 0:26:26.240000::brown like mesh bag. It kind of seemed like that like maybe the sniffings of a bag.
0:26:29.360000 - 0:26:31.920000::Yeah, it was all kind of scary. It was one of the...
0:26:31.920000 - 0:26:37.040000::What did you bring it up to the server? Here's how we brought the server's response.
0:26:38.640000 - 0:26:43.360000::So they get to the table and I stepped on their foot as hard as I could
0:26:44.640000 - 0:26:48.880000::and I didn't let them get leave and I looked right into their eye and I said
0:26:49.520000 - 0:26:58.320000::nice try. Why don't you try to kill me? I'm not lying man and then I took out a syringe. I put
0:26:58.320000 - 0:27:02.320000::them to sleep. They woke up in like a training camp that I have like waiters go to when they fuck
0:27:02.320000 - 0:27:07.840000::up me because I'm like I actually respect you for this like and I want to put you into a little
0:27:07.840000 - 0:27:13.040000::private service in another country. Really nice thing you do that. Yeah, I'm good. I'm good. Jack.
0:27:13.120000 - 0:27:18.560000::No, no, no. What we really did is we said hey it's not a big deal but we found I just
0:27:18.560000 - 0:27:23.760000::wanted to let you know that we found a bunch of plastic in the salad and we're all good on this
0:27:23.760000 - 0:27:30::and the chicken was fully pink and it was scary. You did and send that back? Yeah, we did and
0:27:30 - 0:27:33.920000::well we didn't even send it back. It didn't seem like there was much of an opportunity too.
0:27:33.920000 - 0:27:43.120000::It's all good. God. And then the there's all sorts of stuff. We got pepper, pepper
0:27:43.120000 - 0:27:47.440000::deli came out tagliatelleops. We're all out of pepper deli. You don't want to fuck with
0:27:47.440000 - 0:27:51.120000::somebody who thinks they're getting a wide noodle and bring a miskinny noodle because you do that
0:27:51.120000 - 0:27:55.440000::in Italy. They'll fucking they'll chop the guillotine on you. There's nothing like a fucking

0:32:04.560000 - 0:32:07.280000::You're not believe in hard enough because you know, that is the
0:32:07.280000 - 0:32:10.800000::level that God needs from you, frankly, to get into heaven.
0:32:10.800000 - 0:32:13.240000::I know that person is going to heaven.

0:32:28.520000 - 0:32:34.120000::I would probably have a mannequin and draw on it and put it in
0:32:34.120000 - 0:32:37.520000::the casket and it would be so obvious that.
0:32:37.520000 - 0:32:38.520000::Wait a minute.
0:32:38.520000 - 0:32:42.240000::So you just have a bunch on Facebook that Nate, you have died.

0:33:21.680000 - 0:33:25::It's interesting that he went straight into a sewer cap.
0:33:25 - 0:33:26.480000::I guess he's dead in the sewer now.
0:33:26.480000 - 0:33:28.680000::And so I'll water down there anyways.

0:46:33.880000 - 0:46:35.480000::because they have no strategy in place.
0:46:35.480000 - 0:46:37.960000::What's interesting about the left is that they are being
0:46:37.960000 - 0:46:39.280000::faster, faster, faster, faster.
0:46:39.280000 - 0:46:40.960000::Oh my god.

0:46:58.640000 - 0:46:59.680000::newness to them.
0:46:59.680000 - 0:47:04.640000::Oh, maybe this could be the next Republican candidate, you know.
0:47:04.640000 - 0:47:07.120000::And it was Robert F. Kennedy.
0:47:07.120000 - 0:47:08.320000::Is he a Republican?
0:47:08.320000 - 0:47:09.320000::Robert F. Kennedy.

0:47:14.160000 - 0:47:17.200000::that comes out on the road inside, they always say one thing
0:47:17.200000 - 0:47:20.240000::where I'm like, damn, I kind of fuck with that.
0:47:20.240000 - 0:47:23.520000::But most of the shit they say, I'm like, yeah, I don't like you.
0:47:23.520000 - 0:47:26.320000::But they'll say it because Vivek was like, I want to fucking take
0:47:26.320000 - 0:47:27.160000::out the FBI.
0:47:27.160000 - 0:47:29.480000::I was like, all right.

0:47:36.760000 - 0:47:39.920000::you know, and I'm willing to say that because it's more complex
0:47:39.920000 - 0:47:43.040000::than left or right, right or wrong.
0:47:43.040000 - 0:47:44.160000::You've seen Michael Clayton.

0:47:48.920000 - 0:47:50::Well, it's a political thriller.
0:47:50 - 0:47:54.840000::All I want to say is that the CIA, I think, is in that one.
0:47:54.840000 - 0:47:59::And they kill a political figure in the most chilling way I've ever seen
0:47:59 - 0:48:00.480000::in my life.

0:48:05.280000 - 0:48:11.080000::They walk in with fucking nylon leggings over their head.
0:48:11.080000 - 0:48:13.040000::So they got, I can't see him.
0:48:13.040000 - 0:48:15.080000::They tase him in the neck, chase him in the jugular.
0:48:15.080000 - 0:48:17.400000::So he's immediately incapacitated.
0:48:17.400000 - 0:48:20.240000::Then they sedate him with like an inhaler thing
0:48:20.240000 - 0:48:21.320000::and it's mouth immediately.
0:48:21.320000 - 0:48:25.560000::So he's tased, then sedated, then they get him on the ground.
0:48:25.560000 - 0:48:29.560000::He's like fully gone and they take his shoes off, take his socks off.
0:48:29.560000 - 0:48:32.560000::They're doing this with surgical precision in the movie.
0:48:32.560000 - 0:48:36.720000::They take the fucking needle and they put the poison into his blood.
0:48:36.720000 - 0:48:40.800000::For it to make into his toe in between his toes to make him have a hard attack
0:48:40.800000 - 0:48:42.720000::and make it look like a natural death.
0:48:42.720000 - 0:48:43.560000::What the fuck?
0:48:43.560000 - 0:48:46::Now, then they put the shoes up and then they say, we're good.
0:48:46 - 0:48:49.200000::We got him and he just looks like he died of a natural cause.
0:48:49.200000 - 0:48:51.960000::How many people have they been doing this to?
0:48:51.960000 - 0:48:56.400000::Okay, I saw that movie and I had been trusting my government up until this point and I thought
0:48:56.400000 - 0:49:01.800000::you're saying political government officials are taking out operative political operations.
0:49:01.800000 - 0:49:02.800000::Russia?
0:49:02.800000 - 0:49:04.600000::It happens and doesn't just happen.
0:49:04.600000 - 0:49:07.560000::Well, they, they, they're just poison them with fucking the most poisonous mushrooms

0:49:08.560000 - 0:49:09.560000::They don't give a fuck.
0:49:09.560000 - 0:49:11.560000::You die from eating the most poisonous mushroom on the planet.
0:49:11.560000 - 0:49:13.400000::What are you talking about?
0:49:13.400000 - 0:49:15.400000::I say I'm saying in Russia, they don't care.
0:49:15.400000 - 0:49:20.600000::That's like a part of their political structure is like poisoning.
0:49:20.600000 - 0:49:22.400000::Like it's like written in their constitution.
0:49:22.400000 - 0:49:25.120000::The poison didn't work on that last dude, Andre, whatever.
0:49:25.120000 - 0:49:26.720000::Oh yeah, they can't get Andre.
0:49:26.720000 - 0:49:30.720000::Wait, did you all see that woman that accidentally, no, she claimed to have accidentally poisoned
0:49:30.720000 - 0:49:34.200000::her entire family with mushrooms?
0:49:34.200000 - 0:49:35.200000::No.
0:49:35.200000 - 0:49:42.600000::And she and her children just magically didn't need the, she poisoned these people to death

0:49:46.280000 - 0:49:47.280000::Why?
0:49:47.280000 - 0:49:48.280000::Why?
0:49:48.280000 - 0:49:49.280000::I don't know, I don't know, I'm falling over now.
0:49:49.280000 - 0:49:50.280000::Can mushrooms get you like that?
0:49:50.280000 - 0:49:51.280000::Good God.

0:50:17.680000 - 0:50:18.960000::Maybe a stew.
0:50:18.960000 - 0:50:20.920000::Why did I know that?
0:50:20.920000 - 0:50:21.760000::So wait a minute.
0:50:21.760000 - 0:50:25.280000::Here's the thing about murdering politicians.
0:50:25.280000 - 0:50:28.800000::If you want to say that you, oh man,

0:50:54.520000 - 0:50:56::You know what I'm saying?
0:50:56.240000 - 0:50:59.080000::When somebody's walking into a dangerous woods and you're standing outside

0:51:26.040000 - 0:51:27.560000::That's where you have to be afraid of.
0:51:27.560000 - 0:51:30.680000::Okay, you can't see them because they work in the shadows and that's how they
0:51:30.680000 - 0:51:31.680000::want it.
0:51:31.680000 - 0:51:34::They want to be under the cover of night when they take you out and they
0:51:34 - 0:51:35.400000::fucking will.

0:53:01.480000 - 0:53:02.480000::This is the answer.
0:53:02.480000 - 0:53:06.120000::Just giving them a little bit more love and more funding to do what they really just
0:53:06.120000 - 0:53:08.560000::let them cook, you know, what they pointed.
0:53:08.560000 - 0:53:09.560000::Sorry.

0:53:11.840000 - 0:53:16.280000::The CIA has pointed assault rifles at my mother and myself.
0:53:16.280000 - 0:53:18.440000::And it's one of the best honors of my life.
0:53:18.440000 - 0:53:23.480000::And that's where I say, yeah, you all were trespassing.
0:53:23.480000 - 0:53:26.080000::We literally didn't even get to the edge of the property.
0:53:26.080000 - 0:53:31.520000::We got off at the wrong exit on the highway and took it, tried to just turn around instead
0:53:31.520000 - 0:53:33.040000::of going through the security checkpoint.
0:53:33.040000 - 0:53:35.640000::And you were not even allowed to do that.
0:53:35.640000 - 0:53:39.040000::What would have happened though if you guys got out of the car, sprinted towards them
0:53:39.040000 - 0:53:40.040000::with your arms outstretched?
0:53:40.040000 - 0:53:41.040000::I don't know, man.
0:53:41.040000 - 0:53:42.040000::This is safe.
0:53:42.040000 - 0:53:43.040000::They're trying to give them a hug.
0:53:43.040000 - 0:53:44.040000::Yeah, yeah.
0:53:44.040000 - 0:53:48.120000::Yeah, I guess they would have dropped the guns and went, yo, good to see you, dude.
0:53:48.120000 - 0:53:51.480000::And we're like, golden retrievers like that energy.
0:53:51.480000 - 0:53:53.560000::You got golden retrie- hell, golden retriever energy.
0:53:53.560000 - 0:53:55.120000::Then we would have taken the guns.
0:53:55.120000 - 0:53:56.120000::Well, down.
0:53:56.120000 - 0:53:57.120000::Well, down.
0:53:57.120000 - 0:53:59.720000::We want to dehumanize these people.
0:53:59.720000 - 0:54:00.720000::But who's behind that gun?
0:54:00.720000 - 0:54:01.720000::Who's behind that title?
0:54:01.720000 - 0:54:02.720000::Humanize.
0:54:02.720000 - 0:54:03.720000::Oh my god.

0:54:23.520000 - 0:54:25.020000::You almost hit the cipher.
0:54:25.020000 - 0:54:29.120000::I just did, huh?
0:54:29.120000 - 0:54:30.920000::I don't know if that's on the internet.
0:54:30.920000 - 0:54:31.920000::All right.
0:54:31.920000 - 0:54:33.520000::Should we say what gave us joy?
0:54:33.520000 - 0:54:37.520000::Or should we say one more crazy riff about the government?
0:54:37.520000 - 0:54:38.520000::I think I just want to-
0:54:38.520000 - 0:54:39.520000::I just want to-
0:54:39.520000 - 0:54:40.520000::People are demanding.

0:55:34.560000 - 0:55:38.280000::So here's let's paint a scenario you're in line at Chipotle
0:55:39.680000 - 0:55:41.680000::Somebody gets up in your ear and goes like this
0:55:42.880000 - 0:55:47.920000::You don't know how I am you turn around. It's fucking Nelly Fertado. Oh

0:55:56.120000 - 0:56:00.440000::So I'll just put it plainly. I saw the back of your head and inspired me to inspire the song
0:56:01.160000 - 0:56:06.800000::All right, what do you do is that what the situation was? Yeah, yeah, that was well then you mentioned that

0:56:13.520000 - 0:56:20.320000::You helped her out and made it not embarrassing for her and then she said that's wrapping towels around her
0:56:20.320000 - 0:56:27.400000::Tell wrapping towels all around not looking closing your eyes and that's when she was like I think my daughters might actually love the fuck out of you
0:56:27.840000 - 0:56:30.680000::Frankly, why don't you come to our palace and do buy?

0:57:08.520000 - 0:57:14.480000::You go up into the waves and you're all tired and you get out there and you think I better not catch a wave anytime soon
0:57:14.480000 - 0:57:19.600000::Because I'm so tired from paddling out that if something bad happens. I don't have any energy left and I'm gonna just gonna die
