0:00:50.280000 - 0:00:52.280000::What
0:00:53.080000 - 0:00:55.080000::River

0:01:28.280000 - 0:01:30.280000::That's kind of the Yiddish moon river
0:01:38.760000 - 0:01:42.460000::They go in between because I was just watching Drew Binsky talking about

0:01:56.480000 - 0:02:03.860000::Right of course not no, but Yiddish and Hebrew are languages and they're switching their interchanging when they use that that's interesting to me
0:02:04.760000 - 0:02:09.620000::Right, yeah, it's really interesting. It's kind of like Chinese has like Cantonese Mandarin
0:02:10.600000 - 0:02:16.320000::Fusah Fusah nice Fusah nice and the Fusah nice. It's it's the smallest little

0:03:43.320000 - 0:03:47.240000::Eleven years ago. Yes for real and I remember here and this guy's intense
0:03:47.480000 - 0:03:50.760000::That's I'm not gonna say what they did because I don't want to breach military protocol

0:03:54.120000 - 0:03:58.360000::War's not getting brought up in this, but we could talk about the military. No, we're done talking about war

0:04:11.640000 - 0:04:15.880000::His discipline and I don't think he's capping about that, but I
0:04:16.840000 - 0:04:20.440000::Could see him having capped at one point about something because everybody caps
0:04:20.600000 - 0:04:23.400000::I don't think he caps. I think he reverse caps where he's like
0:04:24.280000 - 0:04:27.640000::Kind of letting people know about his truth too much where he's
0:04:28.200000 - 0:04:32.920000::People didn't like him because he's out in there in the military and everybody's waking up at four and he's like oh, well go pet
0:04:33.640000 - 0:04:38.840000::Midnight and I went on a run you rat. I'm not capping so in a sense wait

0:05:39.040000 - 0:05:43.400000::What's interesting about this, I wake up and I experience a different type of pain.
0:05:43.400000 - 0:05:45.920000::How hot is the hot sauce that I'm using in my burrito?
0:05:45.920000 - 0:05:49.440000::How much is my stomach hurt from how big the breakfast burrito I make is?

0:05:59.080000 - 0:06:00.080000::Right.
0:06:00.080000 - 0:06:05.880000::Well, it could be more painful than, you know, doing stuff that's not good for you.
0:06:05.880000 - 0:06:06.880000::Really?
0:06:06.880000 - 0:06:12.600000::Oh, I do want to say this, repain, because me, I was talking to somebody about this recently.
0:06:12.600000 - 0:06:17.680000::There really is no way to cheat the balance of the scales in any type of way.
0:06:17.680000 - 0:06:19.200000::Do you know what I'm saying?
0:06:19.200000 - 0:06:20.960000::I immediately understand.
0:06:20.960000 - 0:06:25.280000::Let me give an example of this and I'll bring pain in in a second.
0:06:25.280000 - 0:06:29.160000::We just found out some horrible news about an artificial sweetener called a theory all.
0:06:29.160000 - 0:06:30.160000::You know about this.
0:06:30.160000 - 0:06:31.160000::No way.
0:06:31.160000 - 0:06:32.160000::What?
0:06:32.160000 - 0:06:33.160000::No.
0:06:33.160000 - 0:06:34.160000::Do you know about this, Nate, for real?
0:06:34.160000 - 0:06:36::No, I'm obsessed with artificial sweeteners.
0:06:36 - 0:06:37.800000::That's like, Nate, are you really?
0:06:37.800000 - 0:06:43.800000::That is like, I would say that's a good quarter of my daily calories are diet.
0:06:43.800000 - 0:06:46.600000::No, it does have artificial sweeteners.
0:06:46.600000 - 0:06:48.200000::Artificial sweeteners don't have calories, no?
0:06:48.200000 - 0:06:53.400000::Yeah, but I eat so much it makes it caloric, dent into my, I want to tell me, don't tell
0:06:53.400000 - 0:06:54.400000::me.
0:06:54.400000 - 0:06:55.920000::I'm telling you, dude, because I love you.
0:06:55.920000 - 0:06:57.920000::I care about you.
0:06:57.920000 - 0:07:01.920000::Listen, one of the sweeteners, the theory, because I had just gotten these, it seemed like
0:07:01.920000 - 0:07:06.280000::I was cheating the game because I was eating these delicious peanut butter cups, quest peanut
0:07:06.280000 - 0:07:07.280000::butter cups.
0:07:07.280000 - 0:07:09.120000::Yeah, I'll put their night one blast.
0:07:09.120000 - 0:07:11.440000::Fuck them for trying to fuck with my hell.
0:07:11.440000 - 0:07:12.440000::And I was eating them.
0:07:12.440000 - 0:07:16.320000::It was like 200 calories, sure, a lot of, but 20 grams of protein.
0:07:16.320000 - 0:07:20.840000::And I was so satiated by them and I was like, this is a, I'm eating one of these packets
0:07:20.840000 - 0:07:22.240000::a day.
0:07:22.240000 - 0:07:26.800000::I'm going to find out the main ingredient in that ethereal has recently been linked to
0:07:26.800000 - 0:07:35.240000::major increases in stroke, heart, cardiac events, cardiovascular events.
0:07:35.240000 - 0:07:40::This shit, Nate, throw out the artificial sweeteners, except for I think that's for
0:07:40 - 0:07:42.440000::times good to go because I use that.
0:07:42.440000 - 0:07:44.440000::No, I, okay.
0:07:44.440000 - 0:07:49.480000::So at this point in my life, I am so incredibly fucked.
0:07:49.480000 - 0:07:54.920000::And I don't think there is an amount of detoxing or me stopping right now.
0:07:54.920000 - 0:07:57.600000::I don't think the damage is already done.
0:07:57.600000 - 0:08:02.920000::Don't think I have a family history of heart attacks, strokes.
0:08:02.920000 - 0:08:05.320000::There's literally the two things that you just listed.
0:08:05.320000 - 0:08:10.760000::I have, I feel like maybe every single family member that I know has fallen from one of these
0:08:10.760000 - 0:08:11.760000::fucking things.
0:08:11.760000 - 0:08:17.920000::So if I'm on top of that, loading up my fucking body snort in this shit every fucking
0:08:17.920000 - 0:08:20.520000::morning putting that shit in my coffee, eating this shit all the way.
0:08:20.520000 - 0:08:23.160000::Can I ask what, how are you using the artificial sweeteners?
0:08:23.160000 - 0:08:25.160000::What are these, what are you putting them in?
0:08:25.160000 - 0:08:27.600000::I'm putting them in coffee, mainly.
0:08:27.600000 - 0:08:31.720000::And I'm sweetening up, um, uh, smoothies as well.
0:08:31.720000 - 0:08:35.400000::And the coffee, the caffeine's seeping into the poisonous chemicals and probably getting
0:08:35.400000 - 0:08:36.400000::them hyper.
0:08:36.400000 - 0:08:38.640000::So they're probably even fucking crazy in your body.
0:08:38.640000 - 0:08:42.360000::But Nate, don't you feel like, um, Jesus Christ.
0:08:42.360000 - 0:08:43.360000::Just now, come on, man.
0:08:43.360000 - 0:08:46.480000::And the name of joy, in the spirit of the podcast of joy, tag, there's don't you feel
0:08:46.480000 - 0:08:50.200000::like, okay, yes, everybody in my family dies young as hell.
0:08:50.200000 - 0:08:51.680000::I never met any of my grandparents.
0:08:51.680000 - 0:08:54::My uncles are all gone by the wayside.
0:08:54 - 0:08:56.680000::We all don't have any uncles at this point pretty much.
0:08:56.680000 - 0:09:02.760000::Don't you feel like it is your challenge and duty in life to stop that mentality or the
0:09:02.760000 - 0:09:05.440000::fetus mentality and say, you know what?
0:09:05.440000 - 0:09:08.400000::I'm going to tie my sweater around my waist and I'm going to go up and down the mall or
0:09:08.400000 - 0:09:09.640000::something like that.
0:09:09.640000 - 0:09:11.640000::Yeah, you're right.
0:09:11.640000 - 0:09:12.640000::It ends now.
0:09:12.640000 - 0:09:13.640000::It ends tonight.
0:09:13.640000 - 0:09:18.800000::When you mean, Jack, just to explore what you mean by that, you mean like you go mall walking
0:09:18.800000 - 0:09:21.560000::and work that shit off and start exercising and get the health back.
0:09:21.560000 - 0:09:22.560000::Is that reason?
0:09:22.560000 - 0:09:23.560000::Yeah.
0:09:23.560000 - 0:09:25.840000::Well, that's not everybody has access to a gym, go to the mall and just walk back and
0:09:25.840000 - 0:09:26.840000::forth.
0:09:26.840000 - 0:09:29.640000::I do want to say I'm falling in love with the gym.
0:09:29.640000 - 0:09:33.800000::I just started going to not to change subjects, but I put up man.
0:09:33.800000 - 0:09:38.880000::Evolving the spirit would it's basically, you can come there and find me and try to assassinate
0:09:38.880000 - 0:09:42.440000::me and I swear to God, I'll take a plate, smack it in your face.
0:09:42.440000 - 0:09:46.360000::Oh, I know because we told them that they could find us, they could execute us.
0:09:46.360000 - 0:09:47.960000::We told that to the listeners.
0:09:47.960000 - 0:09:54.240000::I thought we told them that we were all going to buy a gun and then everybody gets one bullet.
0:09:54.240000 - 0:09:56.840000::We said a lot of things on this podcast that I can't really.
0:09:56.840000 - 0:09:58.600000::But I'm not worried about any of that.
0:09:58.600000 - 0:09:59.600000::If any of us, yeah.

0:10:00 - 0:10:01.040000::You know what we need to do?
0:10:01.040000 - 0:10:04.920000::I think that this is a perfect opportunity right now.
0:10:04.920000 - 0:10:08.560000::You know, I know we've promised no ads ever on this podcast.
0:10:08.560000 - 0:10:11.880000::Well, never ever, ever, and never bow down to an advertise.
0:10:11.880000 - 0:10:14.320000::Unless the money, unless the money is pretty good,
0:10:14.320000 - 0:10:15.960000::unless it's like decent.
0:10:15.960000 - 0:10:20.880000::But anyways, I think we should practice maybe doing sort of
0:10:20.880000 - 0:10:25.880000::an ad read and how that would sound in a joy tactics way.
0:10:25.880000 - 0:10:28.960000::So I mean, can I just preface this with imagining where this goes?
0:10:28.960000 - 0:10:32.560000::Because imagine I walk into the gym, you know how sometimes the
0:10:32.560000 - 0:10:35.240000::Bose headphones can get a little stinky if you sweat and them too much
0:10:35.240000 - 0:10:36.520000::and you got to get new ear pads.
0:10:36.520000 - 0:10:37.120000::Yeah.
0:10:37.120000 - 0:10:40.120000::Let's mind don't smell bad right now, but let's imagine that they,
0:10:40.120000 - 0:10:42.440000::you know, are going to be smelling bad.
0:10:42.440000 - 0:10:43.720000::I'll go up to the front desk.
0:10:43.720000 - 0:10:44.840000::I take my earphones off.
0:10:44.840000 - 0:10:45.760000::I said, listen to this.
0:10:45.760000 - 0:10:48.840000::It's some person getting paid minimum wage to scan people in.
0:10:48.840000 - 0:10:50.440000::I'm like, check out what we did.
0:10:50.440000 - 0:10:52::I showed them the listeners.
0:10:52 - 0:10:54.600000::It's got whatever 2000 downloads per episode.
0:10:54.600000 - 0:10:55.120000::Holy shit.
0:10:55.120000 - 0:10:56.280000::That's real, honey.
0:10:56.280000 - 0:10:57.640000::And I said, listen to this.
0:10:57.760000 - 0:11:00.080000::And it's a 12 minute ad for evolve fitness,
0:11:00.080000 - 0:11:01.920000::rigid and progress pays.
0:11:01.920000 - 0:11:04.160000::It's kind of those sexual progress picks anybody's.
0:11:04.160000 - 0:11:08.680000::I'm like, can you get your manager over here right now?
0:11:08.680000 - 0:11:09.680000::Oh my god.
0:11:09.680000 - 0:11:10.680000::Let's talk.
0:11:10.680000 - 0:11:11.720000::Let's talk money.
0:11:11.720000 - 0:11:14.360000::They start bumping it up in the speakers at the gym and people are hitting
0:11:14.360000 - 0:11:15.600000::PRs left and right.
0:11:15.600000 - 0:11:16.600000::Yeah.
0:11:16.600000 - 0:11:17.600000::Yeah.
0:11:17.600000 - 0:11:21.880000::Crossfit all of a sudden and becomes this like PD band substance
0:11:21.880000 - 0:11:23.840000::type shit because we're so inspirational.
0:11:23.840000 - 0:11:24.880000::That's his thing.
0:11:24.880000 - 0:11:27.400000::Are we too inspirational to the point where?
0:11:27.400000 - 0:11:28.400000::No.
0:11:28.400000 - 0:11:30.400000::You know how to listen to this shit before you go into competition
0:11:30.400000 - 0:11:33::because you might have a significant.
0:11:33 - 0:11:34.400000::It's like a drug.
0:11:34.400000 - 0:11:37.520000::It's like a drug except it is one, auditorally delivered.
0:11:37.520000 - 0:11:40.520000::Because you know how the, well, you know how they built the pyramids
0:11:40.520000 - 0:11:43.160000::and I'm not trying to change the topics to the pyramids.
0:11:43.160000 - 0:11:46.400000::But you know that those were built with audio technology where they use sound waves
0:11:46.400000 - 0:11:47.880000::to lift the stone.
0:11:47.880000 - 0:11:48.880000::Well, we of course just checking.
0:11:48.880000 - 0:11:51.080000::Let's make sure that listeners might not wait.
0:11:51.080000 - 0:11:53.360000::Before we do that, can we do the head for evolve fitness?
0:11:53.360000 - 0:11:54.360000::Oh, yeah.
0:11:54.360000 - 0:11:55.360000::Yeah.
0:11:55.360000 - 0:11:56.360000::Yeah.
0:11:56.360000 - 0:11:57.360000::All right.
0:11:57.360000 - 0:11:58.360000::So Nate, take it away.
0:11:58.360000 - 0:12:07.360000::So, um, you know, uh, I have been getting back in the gym lately.
0:12:07.360000 - 0:12:14.080000::And, um, I, I think there's nothing more important than your fitness and your health.
0:12:14.080000 - 0:12:15.360000::Can you guys agree about that?
0:12:15.360000 - 0:12:18.680000::Because that's what that's one of the number one health as well.
0:12:18.680000 - 0:12:19.680000::Exactly.
0:12:19.680000 - 0:12:25.360000::And I went to this new gym and I would like to thank the, uh, we have a sponsor this
0:12:25.360000 - 0:12:32.360000::episode and it is, uh, region with, um, evolve, evolve fitness, evolve fitness, fitness,
0:12:32.360000 - 0:12:37.560000::fitness, fitness, can I just say I love like this gym a lot and I've been going there and
0:12:37.560000 - 0:12:38.560000::nobody's mean to me.
0:12:38.560000 - 0:12:42.880000::A lot of the other gyms I go to people come up to me and they spit on my face and they
0:12:42.880000 - 0:12:47.560000::laugh at me for putting on 10 pound plates on the bench press and they say, ah, you fucking
0:12:47.560000 - 0:12:48.560000::idiot.
0:12:48.560000 - 0:12:50.840000::You, you can't bench press, but not here.
0:12:50.840000 - 0:12:52.240000::There's no shaming.
0:12:52.240000 - 0:12:53.880000::There is only positive vibes.
0:12:53.880000 - 0:12:56.320000::The locker rooms smell pretty good.
0:12:56.320000 - 0:12:57.320000::Yeah.
0:12:57.320000 - 0:13:02.320000::And, uh, they're, the, the amenities are out of this, out of sight and, um, well, you've
0:13:02.320000 - 0:13:03.560000::been there a couple times.
0:13:03.560000 - 0:13:04.560000::No, no, no, no.
0:13:04.560000 - 0:13:05.560000::Well, yeah.
0:13:05.560000 - 0:13:06.560000::Well, here's the thing.
0:13:06.560000 - 0:13:09.420000::It's the perfect balance between one of the most excellent gyms and one of the more
0:13:09.420000 - 0:13:12.400000::kind of gyms like they had in the 70s where there's no amenities.
0:13:12.400000 - 0:13:14.400000::It's like rusty weights.
0:13:14.400000 - 0:13:17.880000::It's the middle zone of that and I kind of like living in.
0:13:17.880000 - 0:13:18.880000::Here's the thing.
0:13:18.880000 - 0:13:22.120000::Almost nobody's in there on, uh, on off hours.
0:13:22.120000 - 0:13:23.120000::Okay.
0:13:23.120000 - 0:13:24.120000::Right.
0:13:24.120000 - 0:13:29::So when nobody's there for some reason, why is this that when nobody's there, I can somehow
0:13:29 - 0:13:31.760000::lift way as more weights.
0:13:31.760000 - 0:13:36.560000::Because there's less gravity in the room because there's less people there technically.
0:13:36.560000 - 0:13:42.160000::I think it's more of like, I have such a healthy relationship with my ego that when nobody's
0:13:42.160000 - 0:13:43.760000::around, sure I can bust it out.
0:13:43.760000 - 0:13:45.160000::I can do superhuman strength.
0:13:45.160000 - 0:13:46.160000::Yeah.
0:13:46.160000 - 0:13:50.760000::A lot of people around, I'm so averse to showing off that it fucking actually affects
0:13:50.760000 - 0:13:55::my muscular abilities and yeah, right.
0:13:55 - 0:14:01.640000::But also it's just weird to me here that like whenever you're talking about hitting these,
0:14:01.640000 - 0:14:04::you know, 400 pounds in human PR.
0:14:04 - 0:14:05::Or record personal.
0:14:05 - 0:14:06::Yeah.
0:14:06 - 0:14:11.240000::Just really, really like an amount of weight that I couldn't imagine like, uh, like literally
0:14:11.240000 - 0:14:12.480000::the rock hitting.
0:14:12.480000 - 0:14:13.480000::You know what I'm saying?
0:14:13.480000 - 0:14:15.920000::Whenever you do that, you're like, oh, I was alone.
0:14:15.920000 - 0:14:16.920000::Yeah.
0:14:16.920000 - 0:14:22.920000::You know, like, yeah, you get what mothers can get strength from like if the car was
0:14:22.920000 - 0:14:28.480000::putting their child to the pavement, they can somehow, someone enough motherly strength
0:14:28.480000 - 0:14:31::right to do superhuman things.
0:14:31 - 0:14:35.240000::I put myself through crazy as it's like I'm doing acting exercises on the fucking
0:14:35.240000 - 0:14:37.760000::mats and I'm imagining the worst shit.
0:14:37.760000 - 0:14:38.760000::And I imagine it.
0:14:38.760000 - 0:14:44.040000::I'm almost dying badly from being crushed by all type of different weights and crazy
0:14:44.040000 - 0:14:46.600000::shipping containers and all this stuff.
0:14:46.600000 - 0:14:52.800000::And my imagination actually is helping my fitness, which is I never thought acting could
0:14:52.800000 - 0:14:53.800000::help me.
0:14:53.800000 - 0:14:55.720000::Now, I do it more methodly.
0:14:55.720000 - 0:14:58.880000::I'll tell you what I do it more method that I might have to try that out.
0:14:58.880000 - 0:15:00.040000::But what I do is I get a lot of things.

0:15:00 - 0:15:06.480000::at a 50 pound dumbbell and while my girlfriend's asleep in bed, I hold it out over her head
0:15:06.480000 - 0:15:07.480000::and it's real deal.
0:15:07.480000 - 0:15:09.480000::If I drop this shit, it's over.
0:15:09.480000 - 0:15:11.320000::I'm not acting like a genius.
0:15:11.320000 - 0:15:12.320000::It's method.
0:15:12.320000 - 0:15:15.720000::No, you know, I'm like screaming and she's having a sweet dream about whatever.
0:15:15.720000 - 0:15:18.040000::So I really do like that.
0:15:18.040000 - 0:15:22.280000::And now how come whenever I go to the gym because I've tried a gym and I tried to get
0:15:22.280000 - 0:15:28.880000::a personal trainer one time and this person basically mentally tortured me.
0:15:28.880000 - 0:15:31.360000::This is a no, this was somewhere else.
0:15:31.360000 - 0:15:36.680000::This was in Chicago and this person lied to me about having brain cancer in order to get
0:15:36.680000 - 0:15:39.280000::me to help them pay for their medical bills.
0:15:39.280000 - 0:15:41.160000::They ended up getting fired.
0:15:41.160000 - 0:15:45.120000::They were telling me telling people that they were not doing steroids.
0:15:45.120000 - 0:15:50.160000::They were they were like the second I told them because it was like I did a trial and
0:15:50.160000 - 0:15:51.960000::when I told them like, yeah, I'm not going to extend it.
0:15:51.960000 - 0:15:54.440000::They were like, Hey man, I brain cancer.
0:15:54.440000 - 0:15:57::Also cheated on my husband.
0:15:57 - 0:15:59.400000::So they just started being so rude to me.
0:15:59.400000 - 0:16:02::We used to have so much fun all the time.
0:16:02 - 0:16:06.080000::All of a sudden I said, I'm not going to give them their business any business.
0:16:06.080000 - 0:16:07.520000::It starts being all mean to me.
0:16:07.520000 - 0:16:09.320000::But then he got fired.
0:16:09.320000 - 0:16:12.200000::Well did you ask him, Nadia, Nadia or not?
0:16:12.200000 - 0:16:14.040000::Well back then they didn't have that phrase theology.
0:16:14.040000 - 0:16:18.640000::Otherwise, if it was now I would have said, Hey man, well back then, this is to that,
0:16:18.640000 - 0:16:19.640000::you know, this is wait.
0:16:19.640000 - 0:16:22.320000::This is before by building had entered the like Nadia or not.
0:16:22.320000 - 0:16:24.120000::Nadia or not Nate.
0:16:24.600000 - 0:16:26::Nate, you haven't been asked this.
0:16:26 - 0:16:27.680000::I get asked this all the fucking time.
0:16:27.680000 - 0:16:29.200000::Me too when they see this.
0:16:29.200000 - 0:16:31.200000::This hamstring.
0:16:31.200000 - 0:16:35.200000::You go up to the more Jack people in the gym and some of you can clear this is just a

0:16:36.200000 - 0:16:38.760000::You can see who clearly is on the fucking crank.
0:16:38.760000 - 0:16:42.800000::Understanding now and they have to answer if they're Nadia and some of them give the
0:16:42.800000 - 0:16:43.800000::last name out a lot.
0:16:43.800000 - 0:16:45.640000::Dude, when I come, you guys are on tiktok.
0:16:45.640000 - 0:16:47.040000::Eric got in tiktok.

0:16:50.640000 - 0:16:54.080000::This is me in the gym because I'm lifting so much weights that people are starting to
0:16:54.080000 - 0:16:55.080000::look at me.
0:16:55.080000 - 0:16:56.920000::So when I'm lifting weights, I go like this.
0:16:56.920000 - 0:16:57.920000::Don't be suspicious.
0:16:57.920000 - 0:16:58.920000::Don't be suspicious.
0:16:58.920000 - 0:16:59.920000::Oh, that's hilarious.

0:17:07.920000 - 0:17:08.920000::Cause I'm a little group among us.
0:17:08.920000 - 0:17:09.960000::I'll be walking around like the little fox rabbit from door to the explorer trying to lift
0:17:09.960000 - 0:17:10.960000::ass weights in my bandit.
0:17:10.960000 - 0:17:11.960000::It's called stick.

0:17:28.160000 - 0:17:29.720000::That's what I was about to say.
0:17:29.720000 - 0:17:30.720000::That's what I was about to say.
0:17:30.720000 - 0:17:31.720000::That's what I was about to say.
0:17:31.720000 - 0:17:32.720000::Because of the joy.
0:17:32.720000 - 0:17:35::The mungus brought peace to earth and a time of crisis.
0:17:35 - 0:17:38.440000::It was a haven in a heartless world among us during the COVID.
0:17:38.440000 - 0:17:42.640000::I'm saying that a mungus artist must have better have made at least a bill from all that.
0:17:42.640000 - 0:17:46::Cause the cute art is the only reason that game took off.
0:17:46 - 0:17:47::You think it would be shit?

0:21:17.760000 - 0:21:19.880000::not to bring up some terrifying.
0:21:19.880000 - 0:21:21.720000::But there was just a video,
0:21:21.720000 - 0:21:23.560000::there was just a video of a guy trying to pull
0:21:23.560000 - 0:21:26.400000::one of these bikini embraces into his truck
0:21:26.400000 - 0:21:29.360000::from like, oh, no, I tried to pull her in.

0:21:36.520000 - 0:21:37.360000::He tried to zip tire in.
0:21:37.360000 - 0:21:39.640000::He's a new packet of new wine opener or something.
0:21:39.640000 - 0:21:41.320000::And this guy got out on bail.
0:21:41.320000 - 0:21:43.120000::I'm thinking, what are you doing?
0:21:43.120000 - 0:21:44.600000::You know what I'm saying?
0:21:44.600000 - 0:21:45.960000::Yeah, you know who probably bailed them out
0:21:45.960000 - 0:21:48.800000::is this person's father so they could shoot him in the head.
0:21:48.800000 - 0:21:50.240000::Oh, I'll be so desperate.
0:21:50.240000 - 0:21:52.720000::Hey, Saloshi.

0:21:59.480000 - 0:22:01.680000::because I'm focused on my career like Seth Rogan,
0:22:01.680000 - 0:22:04.920000::but if I was going to, I'd probably
0:22:04.920000 - 0:22:08.360000::have reinforced them with like your dinner's
0:22:08.360000 - 0:22:09.880000::going to be as good as you behave.
0:22:09.880000 - 0:22:11.360000::So if you behave fucking good, I'm
0:22:11.360000 - 0:22:13.840000::literally put a suit and tie on and come out with a menu
0:22:13.840000 - 0:22:18.040000::and be like, serve them, whoever you menu for tonight.
0:22:18.040000 - 0:22:19.080000::But guess what?
0:22:19.080000 - 0:22:20.840000::If they don't take out the trash,
0:22:20.840000 - 0:22:22.920000::if they don't take a shower and they smell stinky,
0:22:22.920000 - 0:22:24.240000::guess what I'm going to do?

0:22:25.800000 - 0:22:27.640000::It's a sandwich, you know what's in it?
0:22:30.080000 - 0:22:30.920000::What?
0:22:30.920000 - 0:22:31.920000::Knuckles.
0:22:31.920000 - 0:22:34.120000::I'm beat the fuck out of them.
0:22:34.120000 - 0:22:34.960000::Knuckles, thank you.
0:22:34.960000 - 0:22:37.160000::If I, when I was a kid and I heard that I was having
0:22:37.160000 - 0:22:38.800000::chicken and brown rice for dinner,
0:22:38.800000 - 0:22:41.160000::I literally wanted to kill myself.
0:22:43.240000 - 0:22:46.640000::And sweet baby rays like, you know what I mean?
0:22:46.640000 - 0:22:48.840000::I feel for the parents, it's hard to cook dinners,
0:22:48.840000 - 0:22:51.200000::but I just did not want to eat that shit.
0:22:51.200000 - 0:22:52.920000::Hey, man, that sounds as fucking nutritious
0:22:52.920000 - 0:22:55.760000::compared to what was cooking up in the Benzinger household.
0:22:55.760000 - 0:22:57.640000::What are you guys making?
0:22:57.640000 - 0:22:59.680000::I know, that's complaining, but whatever.
0:22:59.680000 - 0:23:00.920000::I hated the taste of it.
0:23:02.120000 - 0:23:06.880000::Let's just say 99% of my molecules are velvita
0:23:06.880000 - 0:23:09.880000::or just regular ass pasta with tomato sauce.
0:23:09.880000 - 0:23:12.200000::Yeah, I had a very similar,
0:23:12.200000 - 0:23:17.200000::I was eating some busted ass fucking meals at the kid.
0:23:17.200000 - 0:23:18.520000::What were you eating?
0:23:18.520000 - 0:23:19.360000::What were you eating?
0:23:20.120000 - 0:23:24.080000::Just like, literally, like, you know those like penguin?
0:23:24.080000 - 0:23:25.880000::I feel like we were eating like those kids.
0:23:25.880000 - 0:23:27.280000::Oh yeah, those crazy penguins.
0:23:27.280000 - 0:23:28.120000::Oh my god.
0:23:28.120000 - 0:23:30.680000::The frozen meals that were just like,
0:23:30.680000 - 0:23:32.640000::it's basically like not even food.
0:23:32.640000 - 0:23:35.600000::I feel like we were eating that like when I was well into my
0:23:35.600000 - 0:23:37.800000::like junior year of high school.
0:23:37.800000 - 0:23:39.920000::You know, I'll just tell you now, Nate, I take everything back
0:23:39.920000 - 0:23:41.640000::about the staying away from sweeteners
0:23:41.640000 - 0:23:44.160000::because you already got it in some crazy ass way.
0:23:44.160000 - 0:23:45.880000::For the meals.
0:23:45.880000 - 0:23:47.240000::It's coming out.
0:23:47.280000 - 0:23:49.640000::The death is coming out to me from all different types of
0:23:49.640000 - 0:23:50.480000::angles.
0:23:50.480000 - 0:23:52.520000::It's like, I can't even avoid it at this point, especially
0:23:52.520000 - 0:23:53.520000::hang out with Eric.
0:23:53.520000 - 0:23:56.600000::Eric's kind of a black hole of death a little bit.
0:23:56.600000 - 0:23:59.160000::You attract death and you attract negativity in a way
0:23:59.160000 - 0:24:02.240000::that I've never seen a human being in my life.
0:24:02.240000 - 0:24:04.200000::You must have some crazy type of aura
0:24:04.200000 - 0:24:07.440000::or sort of connection with the cosmic realm that you must have
0:24:07.440000 - 0:24:09.920000::watched a lot of Billy and Mandy growing up.
0:24:09.920000 - 0:24:10.760000::Right.
0:24:10.760000 - 0:24:12.960000::I wouldn't allow to watch that.
0:24:12.960000 - 0:24:14.520000::I don't know.
0:24:14.520000 - 0:24:16.680000::You know, the death thing is a little bit real.
0:24:16.720000 - 0:24:19.680000::I do feel like I've not seen it in a lot of people that died.
0:24:19.680000 - 0:24:23.200000::But the positive, the negativity thing is wrong due
0:24:23.200000 - 0:24:26.640000::because I think I bring positivity to all environments,
0:24:26.640000 - 0:24:28.120000::except for the ones I hate.
0:24:28.120000 - 0:24:29.120000::That's what I'm talking about.
0:24:29.120000 - 0:24:32.120000::You do, but in a way that's like Chris Farley style
0:24:32.120000 - 0:24:34.480000::where it's like, oh my god, this guy's like so sweet
0:24:34.480000 - 0:24:38.120000::and you know, nice, but there's some kind of like darkness.
0:24:38.120000 - 0:24:42.640000::If you ever meet somebody who is like so incredibly kind
0:24:42.640000 - 0:24:46.240000::and generous and you know, everybody said that about Chris,
0:24:46.240000 - 0:24:48.720000::he would just be, he would just be the life of the party
0:24:48.720000 - 0:24:51.920000::and he would, you know, go to a nursing home every week
0:24:51.920000 - 0:24:55.600000::to volunteer just on his own and nobody knew about it.
0:24:55.600000 - 0:25:00::But people like that have the craziest demons deep down

0:25:00 - 0:25:01.680000::and they are burying them.
0:25:01.680000 - 0:25:05.520000::And in a weird way, I feel like that is transmuted
0:25:05.520000 - 0:25:08.800000::into positivity and kindness.
0:25:08.800000 - 0:25:11.800000::So I have to be a little suspicious of you, Eric.
0:25:11.800000 - 0:25:13.520000::And I do love all the positive shit
0:25:13.520000 - 0:25:16.320000::that you bring to our personal relationship
0:25:16.320000 - 0:25:18.200000::and people around you, which is a lot
0:25:18.200000 - 0:25:20.400000::and way too much to the point where I'm concerned
0:25:20.400000 - 0:25:24.200000::for your demons getting buried in all of that shit.
0:25:25.040000 - 0:25:25.880000::That is so.
0:25:25.880000 - 0:25:27.720000::You made me think, you just made me think,
0:25:27.720000 - 0:25:29::I've shown Jack in these videos,
0:25:29 - 0:25:31.920000::I'm not going to say the name of this YouTube channel,
0:25:31.920000 - 0:25:36.920000::but there's a man who goes around the country
0:25:36.920000 - 0:25:41.160000::and interviews and like,
0:25:42.400000 - 0:25:44.720000::I don't want to say human eyes because obviously they're human,
0:25:44.720000 - 0:25:47.680000::but all these kids with horrible disability,
0:25:47.680000 - 0:25:50.880000::not all horrible, but varying degrees of disabilities.
0:25:50.880000 - 0:25:53.400000::And this guy is so sweet and so patient with,
0:25:53.400000 - 0:25:55.640000::you know what I'm talking about, Jack?
0:25:55.640000 - 0:25:56.960000::I do.
0:25:56.960000 - 0:25:59.320000::Okay, so sweet, so patient, so general,
0:25:59.320000 - 0:26:03::like doing an amazing thing by giving these kids a platform
0:26:03 - 0:26:06.040000::to talk, but I have had to imagine
0:26:06.040000 - 0:26:08.160000::is there darkness there within him?
0:26:08.160000 - 0:26:09.680000::For because you know what I mean?
0:26:09.680000 - 0:26:14.240000::I was saying earlier, there's balance in all.
0:26:14.240000 - 0:26:15.080000::You know what I'm saying?
0:26:15.080000 - 0:26:16.520000::So he does this amazing thing.
0:26:16.520000 - 0:26:17.520000::Maybe he's dark.
0:26:17.520000 - 0:26:18.680000::He is dark.
0:26:18.680000 - 0:26:19.760000::That's what he is dark.
0:26:19.760000 - 0:26:22.080000::He has dark, maybe he's dark.
0:26:22.080000 - 0:26:22.920000::You know what?
0:26:22.920000 - 0:26:26.880000::Sometimes the, sometimes the path to light
0:26:26.880000 - 0:26:28.960000::is through a dark tunnel and so be it.
0:26:28.960000 - 0:26:31.240000::You can't get out of that cave without going towards light
0:26:31.240000 - 0:26:33.960000::and you know, everybody gets too light from a dark place.
0:26:33.960000 - 0:26:36.200000::So if you're hiding some demons and trying to fight them off
0:26:36.200000 - 0:26:37.640000::by doing charity, good on you,
0:26:37.640000 - 0:26:40.720000::at least you're not leaning in further and further through it.
0:26:40.720000 - 0:26:41.560000::True.
0:26:41.560000 - 0:26:42.400000::Because these guys, sure,
0:26:42.400000 - 0:26:43.160000::maybe he's doing it for money,
0:26:43.160000 - 0:26:45.240000::profiting off of people who are in circumstances
0:26:45.240000 - 0:26:46.680000::we can never imagine,
0:26:46.680000 - 0:26:48.240000::but what did we say about the vending machine
0:26:48.240000 - 0:26:50::on the last episode?
0:26:50 - 0:26:50.960000::I forget.
0:26:50.960000 - 0:26:52.040000::Me too.
0:26:52.040000 - 0:26:53.520000::I mean, as well.
0:26:54.520000 - 0:26:57.720000::Wait, but I want to ask you guys this question seriously
0:26:57.720000 - 0:26:58.600000::about this balance.
0:26:58.600000 - 0:27:00.680000::This balancing is so obvious, right?
0:27:00.680000 - 0:27:01.520000::It's everybody.
0:27:01.520000 - 0:27:02.800000::Go ahead, go ahead.
0:27:02.800000 - 0:27:03.720000::But I'm just thinking like,
0:27:03.720000 - 0:27:05.320000::can you think of any way to cheat?
0:27:05.320000 - 0:27:09.840000::Because like the ethereal, perfect example, reward now.
0:27:10.960000 - 0:27:13.880000::The horrible hospital stays later.
0:27:13.880000 - 0:27:15.640000::I'm, let me give you another example.
0:27:15.640000 - 0:27:16.480000::Yeah.
0:27:16.480000 - 0:27:17.400000::Workout, that's pain.
0:27:17.400000 - 0:27:18.720000::That sucks why you're doing it.
0:27:18.720000 - 0:27:21.240000::Unless you're crazy like that, like Mr. Goggins.
0:27:22.240000 - 0:27:25.680000::Then after that, you're rewarded with a crazy ass body
0:27:25.680000 - 0:27:28.720000::and body highs from working out all chemicals on three.
0:27:28.720000 - 0:27:29.560000::Right.
0:27:29.560000 - 0:27:32.200000::So wait, do you see anything that can cheat the balance?
0:27:32.200000 - 0:27:33.040000::I do.
0:27:33.040000 - 0:27:33.880000::I do.
0:27:33.880000 - 0:27:34.880000::What is that?
0:27:34.880000 - 0:27:36.760000::Well, what's very serious about this?
0:27:36.760000 - 0:27:39.600000::I'm immediately going into my year 3000 style brand.
0:27:39.600000 - 0:27:41.600000::You guys know that I think like this.
0:27:41.600000 - 0:27:43.360000::You think differently, man.
0:27:43.360000 - 0:27:45.360000::I do because what I do is when someone asks,
0:27:45.360000 - 0:27:46.560000::basically every sentence like here,
0:27:46.560000 - 0:27:48.600000::somebody saying is a riddle for what they're really
0:27:48.600000 - 0:27:49.720000::meaning to say to me.
0:27:49.720000 - 0:27:51.200000::And I have to decipher what they're saying.
0:27:51.200000 - 0:27:52.280000::And then say, here's what you really mean.
0:27:52.280000 - 0:27:54.560000::Maybe that's why you're so tired sometimes, you know?
0:27:54.560000 - 0:27:56.520000::Like you're just always working like.
0:27:56.520000 - 0:27:59.040000::I've been to so many fucking doctors my whole life
0:27:59.040000 - 0:28:00.240000::trying to figure out why I'm so tired.
0:28:00.240000 - 0:28:01.080000::And I can't figure it out.
0:28:01.080000 - 0:28:04.120000::Your brain is working on like an Eric's like busted PC
0:28:04.120000 - 0:28:05.360000::level like I do think.
0:28:05.360000 - 0:28:09.080000::I do think it is true.
0:28:09.080000 - 0:28:11.920000::Like if I think about like, I think that your brain
0:28:11.920000 - 0:28:14.560000::is making that type of like, and it literally is
0:28:14.560000 - 0:28:16.440000::because I got the tonight is like, you wouldn't believe.
0:28:16.440000 - 0:28:18.560000::My tonight is this fucking like, it sounds like a concert
0:28:18.560000 - 0:28:19.560000::all day.
0:28:19.560000 - 0:28:20.560000::You have to.
0:28:20.560000 - 0:28:23.320000::That made that drive some people to suicide.
0:28:23.320000 - 0:28:24.160000::All right.
0:28:24.160000 - 0:28:27.600000::Tonight is cool, man.
0:28:27.600000 - 0:28:30.080000::I just watched a documentary about I'm sure it won't.
0:28:30.080000 - 0:28:31.920000::No, but I'm always here.
0:28:31.920000 - 0:28:32.800000::You're 2000 brain.
0:28:32.800000 - 0:28:34.080000::You're 2000 brain.
0:28:34.080000 - 0:28:35.080000::Right.
0:28:35.080000 - 0:28:36.080000::You got to remind me what we're talking about straight up.
0:28:36.080000 - 0:28:37.080000::Oh, about the balance.
0:28:37.080000 - 0:28:37.920000::What cheats the balance?
0:28:37.920000 - 0:28:39.400000::I think the balance is this.
0:28:39.400000 - 0:28:43.040000::So you what the problem is that's going on here is what
0:28:43.040000 - 0:28:47.760000::you're doing is you're selecting circumstances in which
0:28:47.760000 - 0:28:50.200000::this balance seems unattainable, right?
0:28:50.200000 - 0:28:52.600000::But I invite you to just think about this.
0:28:52.600000 - 0:28:57.560000::Most things in life, the balance is automatic.
0:28:57.560000 - 0:29:00.440000::When it comes to having amazing meaningful friendships,
0:29:00.440000 - 0:29:01.760000::the balance is there.
0:29:01.760000 - 0:29:03.480000::When it comes to making connections,
0:29:03.480000 - 0:29:06.120000::there is no negative thing you have to do.
0:29:06.120000 - 0:29:08.640000::When you put in positivity towards something,
0:29:08.640000 - 0:29:10.920000::there are so many times that positivity comes out.
0:29:10.920000 - 0:29:14.440000::If you go into a scenario and you ask somebody about themselves,
0:29:14.440000 - 0:29:17.240000::about their parents or this whatever hair,
0:29:17.240000 - 0:29:19.320000::they're going to appreciate that.
0:29:19.320000 - 0:29:20.600000::You're going to learn something cool.
0:29:20.600000 - 0:29:22.680000::Do you get what I'm trying to get at?
0:29:22.680000 - 0:29:25.760000::Let me counter that, but in a positive way.
0:29:25.760000 - 0:29:30.120000::Listen, if you put tremendous love and care
0:29:30.120000 - 0:29:33.640000::and attention into people, this is what we
0:29:33.640000 - 0:29:35.960000::were put on this planet to do is to love others and make
0:29:35.960000 - 0:29:39.320000::connections and have friends and laugh and have conversations
0:29:39.320000 - 0:29:40.160000::and whatever.
0:29:40.160000 - 0:29:40.680000::Sip.
0:29:40.680000 - 0:29:41.560000::Yeah.
0:29:41.560000 - 0:29:45.160000::And sip on whatever natural wine, whatever you want.
0:29:45.160000 - 0:29:47.200000::But I'll tell you, you put that in there.
0:29:47.200000 - 0:29:47.800000::That's great.
0:29:47.800000 - 0:29:48.640000::That thing's going to happen.
0:29:48.680000 - 0:29:49.360000::But guess what?
0:29:49.360000 - 0:29:52.360000::Every friendship has an end point,
0:29:52.360000 - 0:29:57.120000::whether that be a falling out or death or loss.
0:29:57.120000 - 0:29:58.120000::Are you looking at me?
0:29:58.120000 - 0:29:59.120000::I can tell you that.
0:29:59.120000 - 0:29:59.960000::Great.

0:30:00 - 0:30:00.840000::Yeah.
0:30:00.840000 - 0:30:02.340000::Like sure.
0:30:02.340000 - 0:30:04.800000::So the word in here about something you just,
0:30:04.800000 - 0:30:06.320000::but I think that's beautiful.
0:30:06.320000 - 0:30:07.320000::No, I don't think no, no, no.
0:30:07.320000 - 0:30:08.320000::Okay, thank you for saying that
0:30:08.320000 - 0:30:10.120000::because I think it's a dark outlook.
0:30:10.120000 - 0:30:11.360000::Somebody dies with somebody.
0:30:11.360000 - 0:30:12.160000::All right, go ahead.
0:30:13.320000 - 0:30:16.200000::It's like, it's almost the most beautiful thing
0:30:16.200000 - 0:30:18.680000::about life to me in a very honest way of like,
0:30:19.720000 - 0:30:22::you know, I mean, I'm thinking about,
0:30:22 - 0:30:23.960000::I was just talking to someone the other day about my pillars
0:30:23.960000 - 0:30:27.840000::of life, what I find to be the most important in life.
0:30:27.840000 - 0:30:28.880000::What did I say?
0:30:28.880000 - 0:30:31.280000::I said, playfulness up top.
0:30:31.280000 - 0:30:33.400000::And this was when Eric was at his poets meeting,
0:30:33.400000 - 0:30:34.560000::weekly poets meeting.
0:30:35.520000 - 0:30:38::Somebody asked him, what are your pillars?
0:30:38 - 0:30:40.400000::Okay, second that I had, and this is what I find
0:30:40.400000 - 0:30:43.760000::that I had with my close friends is sort of,
0:30:43.760000 - 0:30:47.360000::this is so, you know what, we're bypassing cringe right now.
0:30:47.360000 - 0:30:50.720000::We're going right to the hard print quadruple bypass.
0:30:50.720000 - 0:30:52.680000::And what I, maybe this is so lame to bring up,
0:30:52.680000 - 0:30:55.880000::but I'm saying the most beautiful part of life to me
0:30:55.880000 - 0:30:59.720000::is laughing in the face of horrible things happening.
0:30:59.720000 - 0:31:02.120000::Laughing to you cry when a friend dies.
0:31:02.120000 - 0:31:04.440000::And you shouldn't be laughing, but basically,
0:31:04.440000 - 0:31:06.040000::you're laughing, I asked up because something
0:31:06.040000 - 0:31:07.440000::in a proper happened.
0:31:07.440000 - 0:31:10.320000::You are laughing when you get the diagnosis.
0:31:10.320000 - 0:31:11.320000::You know what I mean?
0:31:11.320000 - 0:31:13.280000::Like having fun in the face, because guess what?
0:31:13.280000 - 0:31:17.160000::Something so unamanned, we are all on a train
0:31:17.160000 - 0:31:20.760000::that is headed to a final stop and that final stop
0:31:20.760000 - 0:31:24.920000::unless you're very lucky is going to be a catastrophe.
0:31:24.920000 - 0:31:27.480000::You are going to be hurting, worse than you ever hurt
0:31:27.480000 - 0:31:28.640000::right before you die.
0:31:28.640000 - 0:31:29.480000::It's going to be pain.
0:31:29.480000 - 0:31:30.720000::It's all coming for us.
0:31:30.720000 - 0:31:32.480000::The world's going to be ending, but guess what?
0:31:32.480000 - 0:31:33.920000::It's kind of fun to be here and dance
0:31:33.920000 - 0:31:36.440000::till our feet get sore until then.
0:31:36.440000 - 0:31:38.440000::Peace.
0:31:38.440000 - 0:31:41.240000::All right, three, so for the rest of the podcast,
0:31:41.240000 - 0:31:43.560000::32 minutes, we can cut that.
0:31:43.560000 - 0:31:45.040000::I don't know if we want to.
0:31:45.040000 - 0:31:46.040000::That was comedy.
0:31:46.040000 - 0:31:48.960000::I think we can just, yeah, 32 minutes and 10 seconds.
0:31:49.880000 - 0:31:51.880000::For the people who are on the Patreon,
0:31:52.680000 - 0:31:54.960000::or even you know what, on whatever, this is a clip
0:31:54.960000 - 0:31:56.800000::that be fun or if this is on YouTube,
0:31:56.800000 - 0:32:00.680000::why don't you all go ahead and ask us this type,
0:32:00.680000 - 0:32:01.960000::or give us your type of question.
0:32:01.960000 - 0:32:04.840000::What's the meaning of life and we could look at it
0:32:04.840000 - 0:32:06.440000::and discuss it back on the Patreon.
0:32:06.440000 - 0:32:08.520000::But I want to put a warning on this.
0:32:09.640000 - 0:32:11.760000::Nothing has meaning and a vacuum.
0:32:15.520000 - 0:32:18.280000::Nothing has meaning and a vacuum.
0:32:18.280000 - 0:32:20.440000::Everything to have something, nothing just means something,
0:32:20.440000 - 0:32:24.120000::something to be something to the point of being meaningful
0:32:24.120000 - 0:32:25.320000::to something.
0:32:25.320000 - 0:32:26.560000::Does that make sense?
0:32:26.560000 - 0:32:27.560000::Yes.
0:32:27.560000 - 0:32:30.120000::And then Neil, the grass Tyson, what's that Eric?
0:32:30.120000 - 0:32:31.440000::Sorry.
0:32:31.440000 - 0:32:32.440000::How's your dryer?
0:32:32.440000 - 0:32:33.280000::Yeah, what's wrong?
0:32:33.280000 - 0:32:35.920000::A lock fell out of my pocket and was banging up
0:32:35.920000 - 0:32:37.200000::against the glass.
0:32:37.200000 - 0:32:38.640000::How heavy is it?
0:32:38.640000 - 0:32:39.480000::Or what?
0:32:39.480000 - 0:32:41.080000::It was a light lock.
0:32:41.080000 - 0:32:42.760000::Or your locker at the gym?
0:32:42.760000 - 0:32:43.600000::Correct.
0:32:45.800000 - 0:32:46.520000::God damn it.
0:32:47.520000 - 0:32:49.360000::Wait, can we go back to pyramids?
0:32:49.360000 - 0:32:50.200000::Oh, sure.
0:32:50.200000 - 0:32:51.960000::We were going to go, we were going to talk about those
0:32:51.960000 - 0:32:54.760000::for a second and we got derailed.
0:32:54.760000 - 0:32:59.560000::Have a beautiful sand triangles that have blotted the world
0:32:59.560000 - 0:33:03.480000::with some ancient technology that's very clearly unanswered.
0:33:03.480000 - 0:33:04.640000::It's one of, isn't it funny?
0:33:04.640000 - 0:33:06.680000::It's the biggest thing that humans have ever made
0:33:06.680000 - 0:33:09::and it's the thing we know the least about.
0:33:09 - 0:33:10.400000::What can we zoom out?
0:33:10.400000 - 0:33:13.160000::Because I'm not trying to put any spin on this.
0:33:13.160000 - 0:33:15.320000::I'm not putting any humor on this.
0:33:15.320000 - 0:33:19::They legit confuse and confound me.
0:33:19 - 0:33:20.040000::You're not alone.
0:33:20.040000 - 0:33:23::And anybody who thinks they know the pyramids are,
0:33:23 - 0:33:24.840000::you are more confused than anybody.
0:33:24.840000 - 0:33:25.840000::You were sad when they came in.
0:33:25.840000 - 0:33:27.880000::I just wanted to say that they were batteries.
0:33:27.880000 - 0:33:29.360000::Nates drinking Chipotle.
0:33:29.360000 - 0:33:30.800000::Lime stone battery.
0:33:30.800000 - 0:33:33.120000::Nates drinking Chipotle.
0:33:33.120000 - 0:33:37.040000::I said, well, I went to Chipotle and I said,
0:33:37.040000 - 0:33:39.080000::we already had the guacarito.
0:33:39.080000 - 0:33:43.360000::And I said, what kind of other ways can I mix it up at Chipotle
0:33:43.360000 - 0:33:45.240000::and do things that no one's ever done before?
0:33:45.240000 - 0:33:47.600000::So I said, they said, do you want a burrito bowl?
0:33:47.600000 - 0:33:49.120000::I said, no, do you want a burrito?
0:33:49.120000 - 0:33:50.120000::No, do you want a taco?
0:33:50.120000 - 0:33:50.960000::No.
0:33:50.960000 - 0:33:53.360000::I said, get out one of those fucking cups over there.
0:33:53.360000 - 0:33:55.040000::Put it at the front of the line.
0:33:55.040000 - 0:33:56.600000::Fill that bitch up with rice.
0:33:56.600000 - 0:33:57.880000::Fill it up with beans.
0:33:57.880000 - 0:33:59.560000::Fill it up with more.
0:33:59.560000 - 0:34:00.400000::Hit him with the beans.
0:34:00.400000 - 0:34:02.600000::At all the rest of what's in that sour cream bin,
0:34:02.600000 - 0:34:05.680000::I said, pour that fucking bitch into that shit.
0:34:05.680000 - 0:34:07.440000::And I said, give it to me.
0:34:07.440000 - 0:34:10.440000::Now I put a cap on it and I shook it up.
0:34:10.440000 - 0:34:12.080000::It's the hardest I fucking could.
0:34:12.080000 - 0:34:15.400000::And I just walked too much and I walked the fuck out of there.
0:34:15.400000 - 0:34:16.600000::Bitch.
0:34:16.600000 - 0:34:18.520000::Didn't even pay.
0:34:18.520000 - 0:34:22.040000::Nate, anyway, that is awesome.
0:34:22.040000 - 0:34:25.320000::But what I wanted to say about the pyramids was,
0:34:25.320000 - 0:34:27.200000::you mentioned this, Jack.
0:34:27.200000 - 0:34:28.560000::And oh yeah, that's right.
0:34:28.560000 - 0:34:30.160000::You mentioned sound.
0:34:30.160000 - 0:34:31::Yeah.
0:34:31 - 0:34:33::And there's a theory that the ancients
0:34:33 - 0:34:36.040000::had a grip on technology that we don't give them
0:34:36.040000 - 0:34:37.040000::enough credit for.
0:34:37.040000 - 0:34:37.560000::Gorilla grip.
0:34:37.560000 - 0:34:44.160000::And I do believe that the pyramids were created with sound.
0:34:44.160000 - 0:34:46.280000::And how I think this happened was,
0:34:46.280000 - 0:34:50.360000::I think that every human on earth got some kind of
0:34:50.360000 - 0:34:53.320000::conch call or something like that.
0:34:53.320000 - 0:34:54.720000::Every human on earth at a time,
0:34:54.720000 - 0:34:57::which this was probably like 100, 200,000 people
0:34:57 - 0:34:58::or something.
0:34:58 - 0:34:59::12 million years ago.
0:34:59 - 0:35:00::Is that what you just said?

0:35:00 - 0:35:05.400000::Something like that. I think they all pilgrimage to that area, okay?
0:35:05.400000 - 0:35:11.360000::And they all wrapped around the area where the pyramids were and they started singing
0:35:12.120000 - 0:35:15.840000::Something they started singing a song all together in unison
0:35:17.360000 - 0:35:23.480000::And they didn't know what they were singing right now, but what but if we were to listen back to what they were singing
0:35:24 - 0:35:29.320000::Yeah, I think it would have been suit and tie by Justin Timberlake. Ooh, what are my favorites?
0:35:29.800000 - 0:35:33.200000::Because there's something to that song that is when you hear that song
0:35:38.800000 - 0:35:40.960000::Now wait started out earlier than that they
0:35:42.160000 - 0:35:44.160000::Song but the way
0:35:46.160000 - 0:35:49.800000::So I don't think they even knew they didn't English wasn't even around them
0:35:49.800000 - 0:35:54.240000::But I think there's a cosmic connection to that song because you hear that song you're like damn this shit's good
0:35:54.240000 - 0:35:58.320000::This shit is like on another type of conscience type sound wave
0:35:59.320000 - 0:36:04.840000::I think they sang that whole song and it was like like slowly the pyramids were stacking up and building
0:36:06.320000 - 0:36:08.320000::That's one of the most beautiful images
0:36:09.320000 - 0:36:11.320000::I'd like to see people singing that
0:36:11.320000 - 0:36:13.320000::Is that what you really think Nate?
0:36:14.680000 - 0:36:18.200000::Eric yes, don't shame people for you think I'm crazy
0:36:18.200000 - 0:36:22.200000::Error you must think I'm crazy don't you think I'm crazy?
0:36:22.200000 - 0:36:27::I don't do it crazy. I just only have time for serious discussions about this shit
0:36:27.360000 - 0:36:30.080000::Anything else disrespectful to what these ancients built
0:36:30.080000 - 0:36:37.560000::Oh, man. I saw that as extremely serious. I saw that as extremely serious. Oh, I do believe there's a time for that
0:36:37.560000 - 0:36:39.560000::It's a leading theory it's a leading theory
0:36:39.560000 - 0:36:43.080000::I love you're right. I was being disrespectful and I want to apologize
0:36:43.080000 - 0:36:48.680000::No, no, I like to be playful the ancient you know sort of people's out there so that I
0:36:49.160000 - 0:36:52.880000::But I love trying to talk about this because I ended up sounding so foolish
0:36:52.880000 - 0:36:58.240000::But I was watching a video that was like oh, yeah, sure they could have made that but could they have
0:36:58.760000 - 0:37:00.960000::put the pyramids right on the
0:37:02.560000 - 0:37:09.520000::Latitudes and longitudes of so-so and so or could they have gotten this mathematical equation of the architecture of it correct or
0:37:10.320000 - 0:37:15.880000::Isn't it funny that if you add up all the sides it equals a circumference of the earth all this shit that I'm like
0:37:15.880000 - 0:37:18.960000::I don't really know you know the scientists are talking about this
0:37:18.960000 - 0:37:22.200000::But I don't have these facts memorized, but I know something's up
0:37:22.920000 - 0:37:24.440000::Well by the way
0:37:24.440000 - 0:37:27.520000::They're not using enough carbon dating what especially for the artifact
0:37:27.520000 - 0:37:31.520000::Dude because what they're doing is they're just they're just they're looking at the day always saying
0:37:31.520000 - 0:37:37.280000::You're always looking at the dates they're looking at the dates on the site of one thing because people what they didn't realize is a lot of these
0:37:37.280000 - 0:37:40.600000::Artifacts are inherited these pyramids are inherited by the culture of Egypt
0:37:40.600000 - 0:37:46.720000::They are not built by the Egyptians even or whatever and so the people who inherited it in the way that we celebrate
0:37:47.120000 - 0:37:52.760000::The Easter Island heads we kind of have a little ritual there and how often do you know that's not just a head
0:37:52.760000 - 0:37:54.760000::To there's a body underneath
0:37:54.760000 - 0:37:58.760000::Of course I know that of course I know that but what's the thing is how often do you go down the sidewalk and you see somebody
0:37:58.760000 - 0:38:04.400000::Initialed in it right from 2004 or something because they redid the sidewalk, but really that sidewalk was built
0:38:05.240000 - 0:38:10.560000::Hundreds of years ago or whatever whenever they built it and that's the same thing with the pyramids where you're finding an artifact
0:38:10.560000 - 0:38:12.560000::Yeah from the year
0:38:13.760000 - 0:38:17.480000::200 but these pyramids are dating back to
0:38:18.080000 - 0:38:20.080000::Millions of years ago and I
0:38:20.560000 - 0:38:22.080000::Know how this happened
0:38:22.480000 - 0:38:26.120000::Because you'll find that there's pyramids aren't just in Egypt and Giza wherever
0:38:26.680000 - 0:38:28.640000::They are in South America there
0:38:28.640000 - 0:38:33.080000::My pyramids somebody listen to this right now and like what the fuck
0:38:33.280000 - 0:38:38.520000::There are so many and that's okay. I want to say to you. That's okay if you're 25 30 and you never heard this shit
0:38:38.520000 - 0:38:40.920000::There's always a place that you learn about it
0:38:40.920000 - 0:38:47.400000::And if you're not 30 you might want to ear most for this next part because it's gonna scare the fuck out of you with how I believe the pyramids are made
0:38:48.240000 - 0:38:54.200000::And how we have the same type of pyramid that is true east south northwest throughout the globe
0:38:54.480000 - 0:38:57.880000::Do you guys familiar are you familiar rather with the
0:38:59.040000 - 0:39:01.040000::Polar shift
0:39:01.040000 - 0:39:03.040000::That occurs
0:39:03.040000 - 0:39:07.400000::You mean of the incoming global catastrophe that is inevitable and happened
0:39:08.840000 - 0:39:10.520000::But the
0:39:10.520000 - 0:39:11.760000::All the
0:39:11.760000 - 0:39:14::Catastrophe is a theme throughout all ancient art
0:39:14.560000 - 0:39:21.120000::You realize that the flood myth is not just Abrahamic it reaches across mind civilizations
0:39:21.120000 - 0:39:27.440000::It reaches across all type of other Asian civilizations. It happened to know what and all the others
0:39:27.720000 - 0:39:31.720000::Why is there always a flood and why was it always earth?
0:39:31.840000 - 0:39:32.840000::Wiper
0:39:32.840000 - 0:39:34.840000::Because
0:39:35.840000 - 0:39:44::Right in the pole and you know what the CIA we must have been watching the same video the CIA wrote a book on this that they tried to
0:39:44.640000 - 0:39:54.160000::Blacklist rain wash and guess what it just surfaced and guess what this type of catastrophe might be happening sooner than we expect
0:39:54.360000 - 0:39:59.880000::We're overdue for a polar shift and what happens to a civilization when they realized do

0:40:00 - 0:40:05::Let's just say people stop giving a fuck about
0:40:05 - 0:40:08::little silly day to day responsibilities.
0:40:08 - 0:40:09::Yeah.
0:40:09 - 0:40:11::People start saying there was the speed limit.
0:40:11 - 0:40:13::Oh yeah, I don't give a fuck.
0:40:13 - 0:40:15::I want to say this really quick.
0:40:15 - 0:40:18::Really, really quick because I said in the other podcast,
0:40:18 - 0:40:20::I got pulled over for texting and driving.
0:40:20 - 0:40:21::Feel terrible about it.
0:40:21 - 0:40:23::I posted a video today that looked like a,
0:40:23 - 0:40:25::but I recorded that before it happened.
0:40:25 - 0:40:27::So I'm not texting and driving anymore.
0:40:27 - 0:40:31::But I looked up the ramifications of the texting and driving charges.
0:40:31 - 0:40:33::I got five points on my license.
0:40:33 - 0:40:34::Guess what?
0:40:34 - 0:40:35::What the fuck?
0:40:35 - 0:40:37::If I get one more in fraction, if I get six points,
0:40:37 - 0:40:39::I have to pay $300 for a,
0:40:39 - 0:40:41::what they call that license reassessment fee.
0:40:41 - 0:40:44::And then on top of every ticket on top of the base charge,
0:40:44 - 0:40:47::I got another crazy ass charge stacked on top.
0:40:47 - 0:40:50::So I better come correct on the streets because the police are trying to
0:40:50 - 0:40:53::wipe my makeup out like the great flood.
0:40:53 - 0:40:55::Wipe up on my bank account.
0:40:55 - 0:40:56::They really are.
0:40:56 - 0:40:57::But no, no, no, no, no, no.
0:40:57 - 0:40:58::Back to the backs of the floods.
0:40:58 - 0:41:00::But I hope you're heating that real quick.
0:41:00 - 0:41:01::Real quick on that.
0:41:01 - 0:41:05::Just Eric, I think you need to go extra hard with the texting and driving
0:41:05 - 0:41:07::and get these extra points.
0:41:07 - 0:41:09::Because guess what?
0:41:09 - 0:41:10::Guess what?
0:41:10 - 0:41:11::Do you know what?
0:41:11 - 0:41:14::Those act that extra money is going to our teachers.
0:41:14 - 0:41:16::It's going to our firefighters.
0:41:16 - 0:41:20::You like going to our paramilitary citywide.
0:41:20 - 0:41:22::Well, I was thinking if I get my license pulled,
0:41:22 - 0:41:24::I'll finally have to walk like a real New Yorker
0:41:24 - 0:41:26::and I'll finally lose that weight.
0:41:26 - 0:41:29::The airbrace kind of harping on me to get out of the way.
0:41:29 - 0:41:31::I hate cars.
0:41:31 - 0:41:33::God gave me two things to walk on.
0:41:33 - 0:41:34::Can we please go back?
0:41:34 - 0:41:36::I want to keep talking about all this.
0:41:36 - 0:41:37::Reverse.
0:41:37 - 0:41:38::Okay.
0:41:38 - 0:41:42::So what happens when the pole shift is this,
0:41:42 - 0:41:47::all of a sudden the earth is completely gravitationally shifted on its axis
0:41:47 - 0:41:50::within the matter of about eight hours.
0:41:50 - 0:41:53::And when that happens, all of a sudden you're finding hours.
0:41:53 - 0:41:56::And the mammoths are ripped out of the earth.
0:41:56 - 0:41:59::Everything is ripped out of the earth and placed somewhere else randomly.
0:41:59 - 0:42:02::That's why you're finding all these ancient societal bones.
0:42:02 - 0:42:04::What do you think about these kinds of bones?
0:42:04 - 0:42:05::You don't know about the polar shifts.
0:42:05 - 0:42:06::How do you think an eye-see starts, man?
0:42:06 - 0:42:08::How do you think a mini eye-see starts, man?
0:42:08 - 0:42:11::Mammals are uprooted in their, their,
0:42:11 - 0:42:15::what Jack is saying is that this is such a violent event, Nate,
0:42:15 - 0:42:18::that basically you realize that we're moving.
0:42:18 - 0:42:22::We feel everything feels stable and in stasis right now, right?
0:42:22 - 0:42:25::It feels like you're not moving at all.
0:42:25 - 0:42:26::Well, guess what, dude?
0:42:26 - 0:42:29::We are moving at thousands of miles an hour going hella fast.
0:42:29 - 0:42:34::Once this thing, once the pole shift, which is inevitable to happen before,
0:42:34 - 0:42:38::guess what you start to feel is the speed of the earth.
0:42:38 - 0:42:42::The cars, lambs on the brake and you go flying.
0:42:42 - 0:42:44::You're getting Nate, what's going to happen to you is you,
0:42:44 - 0:42:46::the earth is going to suddenly come to a stop.
0:42:46 - 0:42:48::And all of a sudden you're going to be,
0:42:48 - 0:42:49::you're in Los Angeles right now.
0:42:49 - 0:42:52::Well, in about 20 minutes, you're going to be sitting at the,
0:42:52 - 0:42:56::at the fucking, at the diner, or down the street from me,
0:42:56 - 0:42:57::because that's how fast you're going to be.
0:42:57 - 0:42:58::Shooting across the globe.
0:42:58 - 0:42:59::Oh, shit.
0:42:59 - 0:43:00::And you're just going to do,
0:43:00 - 0:43:02::new product, new product just dropped.
0:43:02 - 0:43:04::I got the seatbelt.
0:43:04 - 0:43:06::You put, you have a, a,
0:43:06 - 0:43:08::I'm going to be strapped to the earth, the fucking,
0:43:08 - 0:43:12::I'll lay it on my back and got a seatbelt straight up,
0:43:12 - 0:43:15::a dash to the fucking core, the mantle, or whatever.
0:43:15 - 0:43:17::And I'm going to be strapped up in that fucker
0:43:17 - 0:43:20::and just everybody could come feed me with a spoon.
0:43:20 - 0:43:21::I'm staying in.
0:43:21 - 0:43:22::Bye.
0:43:22 - 0:43:23::You guys can go fucking fly wherever you want.
0:43:23 - 0:43:25::I'm strapped into the earth, bitch.
0:43:25 - 0:43:26::Wow.
0:43:26 - 0:43:27::So you're saying that the earth is a car.
0:43:27 - 0:43:28::Wow.
0:43:28 - 0:43:30::The earth is a car.
0:43:30 - 0:43:32::The way you're describing it is, it's kind of.
0:43:32 - 0:43:33::Yeah.
0:43:33 - 0:43:34::Wow.
0:43:34 - 0:43:36::That makes, it opens up a whole new window for stuff.
0:43:36 - 0:43:38::Earth window.
0:43:38 - 0:43:41::Is there like a phone jack we could put in the ground somewhere?
0:43:41 - 0:43:43::You can, somebody on earth can control the music for the whole globe.
0:43:44 - 0:43:46::And put in the fucking sound.
0:43:46 - 0:43:47::That'd be fun.
0:43:47 - 0:43:49::That would be amazing.
0:43:49 - 0:43:51::The ox core, the earth ox core.
0:43:51 - 0:43:54::Yeah, you got to go down to Argentina and drop a fucking iPod in the,
0:43:54 - 0:43:57::in the well and then you get the, you get to play the tracks.
0:43:57 - 0:43:58::Did you hear about this?
0:43:58 - 0:44:01::This is a little bit of a tangent, but this is another fucking tick tock.
0:44:01 - 0:44:05::We're just all just watching tick tocks and regurgitating what we fuck down there.
0:44:05 - 0:44:06::Right.
0:44:06 - 0:44:10::But, um, there was, who's that racist guy who like Kanye West is like,
0:44:10 - 0:44:13::and coots with the younger Donald Trump.
0:44:13 - 0:44:14::Oh, no, no, no.
0:44:14 - 0:44:15::Oh, what's his name?
0:44:15 - 0:44:16::Nate, whatever.
0:44:16 - 0:44:17::You know, I'm talking about that.
0:44:17 - 0:44:19::That's how on races where we don't know the fuck this.
0:44:19 - 0:44:20::We don't even know.
0:44:20 - 0:44:21::We don't even know.
0:44:21 - 0:44:23::Uh, but Jane, um, but anyway, he said,
0:44:23 - 0:44:24::I know, I know, I know.
0:44:24 - 0:44:25::But, um, what is that?
0:44:25 - 0:44:26::I know, I know, I know.
0:44:26 - 0:44:27::And, um, what is this?
0:44:27 - 0:44:30::If you think of it, Austin, yeah, something.
0:44:30 - 0:44:31::Okay, what about you?
0:44:31 - 0:44:33::But, but he was on a podcast.
0:44:33 - 0:44:34::Nick Fuentes.
0:44:34 - 0:44:35::Nick Fuentes, yes.
0:44:35 - 0:44:38::And, uh, he was on a podcast and he said he was,
0:44:38 - 0:44:48::he was, uh, Kanye West, uh, interaction with Trump when he asked him to be his like running
0:44:48 - 0:44:50::mate this past, you know, a couple of months or whatever.
0:44:50 - 0:44:52::You remember this when he like showed up at Marlowe?
0:44:52 - 0:44:53::Sure, sure.
0:44:53 - 0:44:57::And he said during the interaction, Trump was like,
0:44:57 - 0:44:59::gave him an iPad and said,
0:44:59 - 0:45:00::Hey, put on one of your own.

0:45:00 - 0:45:07::your songs for the whole Marl, or controls all the music in Marlago. And he was like,
0:45:07 - 0:45:11.320000::and he was like, he thought he was going to put on stronger or like some kind of, you
0:45:11.320000 - 0:45:17.160000::know, banger hit. And he said that he put on say you will off of 808's and heart breaks.
0:45:17.160000 - 0:45:24.720000::And I do know that song. How does it go? I say you will. It's like, why would she?
0:45:24.720000 - 0:45:31.720000::It's like a really like sad song that is like really emo. And I just just imagine Trump
0:45:31.720000 - 0:45:38.360000::sitting there, like listening to say you will by Kanye West and all of Marlago listening
0:45:38.360000 - 0:45:44.480000::to it at one point. And then he's like, it just I know that album kind of changed the
0:45:44.480000 - 0:45:50.040000::game for a lot of music in the following years kind of made that type of music kind of cool.
0:45:50.040000 - 0:45:54.280000::But when that album came out and I torrented it, I was so disappointed because I wanted
0:45:54.280000 - 0:46:01::another homecoming, whatever. And it was so different. I'm sorry, man. You can't Eric,
0:46:01 - 0:46:06.680000::why won't you let artists evolve and change? I have a hard time accepting. Well, I guess
0:46:06.680000 - 0:46:10.200000::I have a hard time accepting change in general. Yeah. You're the type of guy who's glad
0:46:10.200000 - 0:46:15.480000::that Andre 3000 quit. You're like, good. Stay out of the business. Oh, I always talk
0:46:15.480000 - 0:46:20::to be with Erica, but I do my favorite. Oh, that's nice.
0:46:20 - 0:46:26.600000::They have a lot together. I just got a fun idea. I just got a fun idea. Wait, I want
0:46:26.600000 - 0:46:32.600000::to bring up after I want to bring up an Easter Island thing. Okay, just okay. All right,
0:46:32.600000 - 0:46:39.400000::go ahead. The heads on Easter Island, right? They I don't know if this is confirmed. I
0:46:39.400000 - 0:46:44.960000::think they think there's bodies underneath giant bodies. Now he's there. Oh, the head,
0:46:44.960000 - 0:46:50.080000::the bodies of the head, not bodies of that. And it's if it's proportional, they're huge.
0:46:50.080000 - 0:46:55.120000::And I the thing I was watching also suggested that that could have been the whatever bearing
0:46:55.120000 - 0:47:00.880000::them. But I'm also thinking, you know where Easter Island is, right? Off the coast of Chile.
0:47:00.880000 - 0:47:06.320000::It's in the smack dab middle, though, the ocean. It's so far from all the other continents.
0:47:06.320000 - 0:47:10.800000::Yeah. And so what we've been told in history classes, and by the way, I'm not saying
0:47:10.800000 - 0:47:15.040000::anything's true. I'm just questioning what we've been told, which is whatever good human
0:47:15.040000 - 0:47:25.200000::beings should do, right? See, yeah. I'm saying we they took canoes out there. Really? You
0:47:25.200000 - 0:47:29.520000::think that they just took a little canoes out? Well, I'm not and not maybe they had cool
0:47:29.520000 - 0:47:34.160000::ships that they built that then, but you know, you're not telling me there was one massive
0:47:34.160000 - 0:47:39.760000::continent where everybody was having civilization together and then they broke up. You know,
0:47:39.760000 - 0:47:45.680000::I mean, well, that's panjaya because but then that would suggest that civilizations were
0:47:45.680000 - 0:47:51.600000::happening on, uh, they were panjaya before the Sumerian before Babel. Oh, they were, man.
0:47:52.720000 - 0:47:56.400000::Did you not listen to what we were all just saying about five minutes ago, dude? They're
0:47:56.400000 - 0:48:04.400000::think about this. How in the last hundred years we went from horse horse and buggy to the Tesla
0:48:05.040000 - 0:48:10.480000::in 100 years and within as many civilization wipeout events catastrophic events,
0:48:10.480000 - 0:48:17.120000::as have happened in the last whatever however long 215,000 at least years of humanity. How many
0:48:17.520000 - 0:48:22.400000::room for hundreds of years of technology has there been? What are you guys just saying this word
0:48:22.400000 - 0:48:27.360000::for word? Because I think I was checking out the dryer from the lock. No, I think me and Nate
0:48:27.360000 - 0:48:32.320000::were just listing movies when you were gone. Oh, I like that. But I agree with the fact I think
0:48:32.320000 - 0:48:40.240000::there's been technology wipeouts. Of course there has. Wife course. Return to sediment. I just want
0:48:40.240000 - 0:48:45.280000::everybody to know to feel comfortable in the fact of not knowing. You know, I'm saying and open
0:48:45.280000 - 0:48:51.040000::yourself. I'm going to be surprised because many beliefs that we hold are just patently incorrect.
0:48:51.840000 - 0:48:55.520000::I don't just count the conspiracy theorists and the science fiction writers because they're often
0:48:55.520000 - 0:49:00::closer to the truth than you might want to believe. Orson Wells, be careful. Watch out. You don't
0:49:00 - 0:49:04.320000::know when James and the giant peach is going to see a giant peach in real. That movie dream. I
0:49:04.320000 - 0:49:11.520000::call nightmares for a long time after I watched it. Okay, will you talk about it?
0:49:11.520000 - 0:49:15.200000::James died on the beach. Okay, talk about it and I have a secret idea. So go ahead.
0:49:15.840000 - 0:49:21.920000::Okay, James and the giant peach is kind of a creepily animated Disney film marketed to children,
0:49:21.920000 - 0:49:27.680000::but she's been muted on zoom. And with the film James. I'm talking over here. It's basically on
0:49:27.680000 - 0:49:33.040000::the beach with his parents. The listen is a little secret. Even though it's probably hard to hear
0:49:33.040000 - 0:49:39.440000::me because we're talking at the same time. But here's the secret. James is a home and a giant peach.
0:49:40.320000 - 0:49:45.360000::Love it. The clouds still out. I don't remember, but I remember thinking this movie's not for me.
0:49:45.360000 - 0:49:49.440000::I'm going to go off mute. This feels like I make a wish that like Eric. Oh, that was interesting.
0:49:49.440000 - 0:49:56.240000::I guess on the podcast. That was mad. Interesting. What did you just do, Jay? Let's just say I am muted
0:49:56.240000 - 0:50:00::and I talked over you that whole time so that the listeners know what I

0:50:00 - 0:50:03.360000::I just said, but you guys don't do that.
0:50:03.360000 - 0:50:05.960000::That's a snap in the face and that's a betrayal.
0:50:05.960000 - 0:50:08.600000::No, it's me. Oh, really? I was just being silly.
0:50:08.600000 - 0:50:09.600000::We can talk about it.
0:50:09.600000 - 0:50:11.040000::I really want to talk to you about games in the dark.
0:50:11.040000 - 0:50:13.200000::You said it sound like I was.
0:50:13.200000 - 0:50:18.600000::Well, if you could just kind of just listen to,
0:50:18.600000 - 0:50:22.480000::I had the privilege of just listening to Eric said.
0:50:22.480000 - 0:50:25.800000::And I couldn't hear what Jack said because he was muted.
0:50:25.800000 - 0:50:30.920000::And Eric, while he was just recounting like the basic Wikipedia
0:50:30.920000 - 0:50:32.800000::plot of games in the giant piece.
0:50:32.800000 - 0:50:38.720000::From my like 1999 viewing of it.
0:50:38.720000 - 0:50:42.800000::1999 fresh.
0:50:42.800000 - 0:50:45.120000::She would say what gave us joy.
0:50:45.120000 - 0:50:47.920000::Oh, Eric's leaving again.
0:50:47.920000 - 0:50:51.480000::Nate, you want to talk about daylight savings real quick?
0:50:51.480000 - 0:50:54.200000::Daylight savings. Absolutely. I would love to.
0:50:54.200000 - 0:50:58.560000::Daylight savings doesn't mean anything anymore because our phones are automatically
0:50:58.560000 - 0:51:06.280000::change. And the time I remembered a time when you had to physically set back a clock.
0:51:06.280000 - 0:51:11.960000::That was analog. And you had to, it was a whole thing that you remember turn your time
0:51:11.960000 - 0:51:15.400000::back and put it forward. But now everything's digital.
0:51:15.400000 - 0:51:20.040000::Who made all these decisions, man? If I had been around for some of the year one human
0:51:20.040000 - 0:51:22.160000::decisions, first of all, I've said this before.
0:51:22.160000 - 0:51:26.040000::I don't know if I said on the pod, but I want there to be infant basically months shouldn't
0:51:26.040000 - 0:51:30.760000::ever repeat. We should keep celebrating naming months more than they stopped at 12 early.
0:51:30.760000 - 0:51:34::These lazy motherfuckers stopped at 12. When me and I, I'm sitting here and I can think
0:51:34 - 0:51:38.640000::of as about as many month names as you could ever fucking think about a koja.
0:51:38.640000 - 0:51:45.080000::El, Elris, Elris, Velris, Koja, Bajon.
0:51:45.080000 - 0:51:48.480000::Bajon. I could literally go forever. And that's just me.
0:51:48.480000 - 0:51:52.280000::And we're getting new astrology signs on top of that. You know, we're bored with this
0:51:52.280000 - 0:51:56.200000::shit. By the way, my dad is getting into astrology at 71 years old.
0:51:56.200000 - 0:51:58.600000::Congrats. They would have the same age of dad.
0:51:58.600000 - 0:52:05.360000::Yeah. He's, he just got his birth chart read and he's a Virgo rising. And he's really,
0:52:05.360000 - 0:52:10.800000::he said he's open to the possibilities of what astrology can tell you about yourself.
0:52:10.800000 - 0:52:16.040000::And he's fully open to all that stuff at this point. And you know, congrats to Mr.

0:52:20.480000 - 0:52:25.960000::Would he do a reading? I'll get him. I'm some bad higher. He would, he would more than
0:52:25.960000 - 0:52:30.280000::I think he would absolutely love that. And all right. We could look forward to your
0:52:30.280000 - 0:52:35.640000::own and blow his shit up. Should I produce an album for him? I think I've asked you
0:52:35.640000 - 0:52:40.600000::this before. Of course. Well, you should co you should co get on the track with them.
0:52:40.600000 - 0:52:44.880000::Father's like, did he, did he style? Did he and daddy? Because my dad is a musician
0:52:44.880000 - 0:52:49.880000::and he's never put out right. A solo kind of project before. And I was like, you know
0:52:49.880000 - 0:52:55.720000::what? I feel like he needs to like put it, he needs to put out the, the, the, the, the
0:52:55.720000 - 0:53:00.440000::Mr. Virone fucking the jams, you know what I'm saying? And I could be, and I could be in
0:53:00.440000 - 0:53:05.740000::the background of the videos and kind of be like, aha, you know, like, did he style DJ
0:53:05.740000 - 0:53:12.720000::Caledon. Imagine someone doing like a voiceover, like a, you know, spoken word over his
0:53:12.720000 - 0:53:22.200000::music. Who's me? Absolutely. But my dad's kind of style is like, I don't even know how
0:53:22.200000 - 0:53:28.720000::to describe it. Like it kind of sounds like a 80s Michael Jackson songs. Like I feel like
0:53:28.720000 - 0:53:37.360000::it's going to sound like that. Like, like beat it. You know, like, yeah. I want to hang out
0:53:37.360000 - 0:53:42.920000::with you. Yeah. I've met your dad and I've met your dad and yet you guys, you have met
0:53:42.920000 - 0:53:47.340000::my dad. I've met Eric's dad. I've met both. Oh, yeah, you met my dad. I've met everybody's
0:53:47.340000 - 0:53:54.260000::dad's here. They're all awesome. By the way. Amazing. Am I that 62? You know, we all have
0:53:54.260000 - 0:54:00::very interesting eccentric fathers. But you know what we need to do as a collective.
0:54:00 - 0:54:06.040000::We need to break these family curses and change that and shatter them. Fucking, we are
0:54:06.040000 - 0:54:11.120000::done with this connective tissue that is drawing us to the past. And we are breaking them.
0:54:11.120000 - 0:54:16.480000::Now, no matter. No more of this. You're not really screaming. You're not. That's not
0:54:16.480000 - 0:54:21.800000::really screaming, man. Let it out. I don't know whenever you're home, you never, when you're
0:54:21.800000 - 0:54:26.680000::out in New York, you scream like crazy. But when you're in the house, you never ever scream.
0:54:26.680000 - 0:54:34.900000::Why is that? I'll tell you what I have my, I'm part Italian. Okay. And I have to hold
0:54:34.900000 - 0:54:39.340000::back my, my natural speaking level and I'm kind of a little bit deaf as well. So this
0:54:39.340000 - 0:54:46.660000::is like double bad. I feel like sometimes what I want to be doing is shouting all day long
0:54:46.660000 - 0:54:52.820000::and yelling at people. And I feel like I can't even get out what I want to say without raising
0:54:52.820000 - 0:54:57.740000::it to a crazy decibel point. You know what I'm saying? I love decibels. So, but I've been
0:54:57.740000 - 0:54:59.660000::trained by so many people to say Nate.

0:55:00 - 0:55:02::You're being too fucking loud.
0:55:02 - 0:55:03::So I have this.
0:55:03 - 0:55:04::Interesting.
0:55:04 - 0:55:06.560000::So I constantly am like so aware of it now
0:55:06.560000 - 0:55:07.920000::that I have to keep my voice.
0:55:07.920000 - 0:55:08.920000::That's a shame, man.
0:55:08.920000 - 0:55:10.360000::And they want to keep me small.
0:55:10.360000 - 0:55:12.880000::And they want to keep me tucked away in the cage.
0:55:12.880000 - 0:55:14.960000::But I'm telling you right now, the cage
0:55:14.960000 - 0:55:16.600000::is about to be unlocked.
0:55:16.600000 - 0:55:18.480000::And I am about to come in.
0:55:18.480000 - 0:55:19.240000::Yes.
0:55:19.240000 - 0:55:21.200000::And I'm about to hit into a new striber.
0:55:21.200000 - 0:55:21.960000::I'm being loud.
0:55:21.960000 - 0:55:23.360000::And I'm being unapologetic.
0:55:23.360000 - 0:55:24.200000::Apologetic.
0:55:24.200000 - 0:55:25.040000::I'm not.
0:55:25.040000 - 0:55:26.800000::I don't like that so much.
0:55:26.800000 - 0:55:29.240000::And I don't care anymore.
0:55:29.240000 - 0:55:30.920000::Starting now.
0:55:30.920000 - 0:55:32.960000::Dude, I be in my girl's ear like,

0:55:41.800000 - 0:55:45.560000::What's bringing me joy is that I be in my girl's ear like this.
0:55:45.560000 - 0:55:47.600000::Is that I be in my girl's ear?
0:55:50.600000 - 0:55:51.360000::Yeah.

0:56:00.160000 - 0:56:01::Even no matter.
0:56:01 - 0:56:02.920000::That's awesome.
0:56:02.920000 - 0:56:05.800000::I wanted the silence there for about 30 seconds.
0:56:05.800000 - 0:56:10.360000::I wanted that silence to last for three whole minutes.
0:56:10.360000 - 0:56:12.800000::And then let's just pick back up like nothing happened.
0:56:12.800000 - 0:56:13.600000::We'll put it in here.

0:56:27.880000 - 0:56:31.920000::You called it for a gotten city and this dealt with time travel in Rome.
