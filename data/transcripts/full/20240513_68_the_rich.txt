0:01:47.900000 - 0:01:52.980000::Just not because we don't have opinions about it. It's just because

0:02:06.700000 - 0:02:11.100000::vicious territory and this kind of triggers a lot of emotions in

0:03:43.140000 - 0:03:50.320000::Well because squids are very intelligent and squids we can't understand their intelligence quite yet and so

0:04:16.780000 - 0:04:19.860000::That's gotta be bad karma. I feel like that
0:04:20.380000 - 0:04:27.340000::I feel good. Well just in the terms of not eating squid because that has got to fucking fuck up your karma
0:04:27.380000 - 0:04:32.960000::If you're if you're ending immortality. Yeah, chicken. All right. That's fucking who cares who gives you shit
0:04:32.960000 - 0:04:37.980000::All throw a chicken against a fucking wall tomorrow fuck their ass up. I don't give a fuck about chicken
0:04:40.780000 - 0:04:46.380000::You know last night we went got more more green food and then we got a whole chicken just cut
0:04:46.740000 - 0:04:51.500000::Right in half it just you know they tear open its ribcage they press that shit down
0:04:51.500000 - 0:04:54.780000::They get it all extra crispy at skin is all crispy and
0:04:54.780000 - 0:04:59.700000::There's stuff about seeing that whole chicken just laying there next to a bunch of radishes

0:05:00 - 0:05:05::That makes me just feel like what have we done, you know what I mean?
0:05:05 - 0:05:09::And I brought, I see the flaws in veganism.
0:05:09 - 0:05:12::Trust me, I've written all about them. I know all the flaws.
0:05:12 - 0:05:16::It's a very flawed system. Very privileged if you asked me to be vegan these days.
0:05:16 - 0:05:20::That's something that only the rich can do by the way to bring it back to the main topic.
0:05:20 - 0:05:28::Right. But I don't think we should be fucking eating these animals for entertainment like this while we talk shit with our friends.
0:05:28 - 0:05:32::You know what I mean? We should be eating that after a long hunt. We should hunt for it.
0:05:32 - 0:05:35::You should have to hunt a chicken for 10 days before you can eat it.
0:05:35 - 0:05:37::And then everything else you else see it's plant based.
0:05:37 - 0:05:40::And then you have to stab that chicken with a damn ass spear.
0:05:43 - 0:05:46::You know what I was thinking about this recently.
0:05:46 - 0:05:50::This brings up a topic that I feel like could be could be fruitful.
0:05:50 - 0:05:51::No, I was just pondering.
0:05:51 - 0:05:54::No, I know probably a prime statement. You probably hit home.
0:05:54 - 0:05:56::Okay. So what we're pondering?
0:05:56 - 0:05:59::Okay, I was pondering this this week.
0:05:59 - 0:06:07::Okay. I feel like we people think that you know people who are like always refer to like.
0:06:07 - 0:06:11::Oh, our ancient ancestors, all right.
0:06:11 - 0:06:18::We weren't depressed or anxious back then because we were hunting and such.
0:06:18 - 0:06:21::And yeah, maybe we didn't have depression back then.
0:06:21 - 0:06:23::But that's still fucking sucked.
0:06:23 - 0:06:29::You know, like I don't think our ancient ancestors were like happy and gleeful all the time.
0:06:29 - 0:06:33::I think they were just I think there's just like we've adapted to.
0:06:33 - 0:06:39::With stand assert a specific lifestyle of sucking.
0:06:39 - 0:06:40::You know what I'm saying?
0:06:40 - 0:06:42::And that is the hunter gatherer lifestyle.
0:06:42 - 0:06:48::That's our shitty life that we're adapted to be okay with and not be depressed with.
0:06:48 - 0:06:49::Okay.
0:06:49 - 0:06:51::That was that's a good lifestyle.
0:06:51 - 0:06:55::When I when I hear hunting and gathering, I think, oh, that's going to be fun.
0:06:55 - 0:06:57::Let me all get everybody together.
0:06:57 - 0:07:01::Let's put on these new purple band-in as I made out of some leaves and some berries.
0:07:01 - 0:07:03::Let's go out and let's attack.
0:07:03 - 0:07:07::Let's attack these motherfucking ducks until they got no home no more.
0:07:07 - 0:07:09::Well, what I pay no worry for you.
0:07:09 - 0:07:11::No, shut the fuck up, man.
0:07:11 - 0:07:14::What I don't like is this capitalistic.
0:07:14 - 0:07:15::Sorry, Mr. Ritch.
0:07:15 - 0:07:17::No, it's because you don't listen.
0:07:17 - 0:07:25::It's because of the products which we are the products which we are driven to believe gives us happiness.
0:07:25 - 0:07:29::Really, one of the happiest you could be is killing an animal.
0:07:29 - 0:07:31::See where I'm going with this?
0:07:31 - 0:07:33::What do you think?
0:07:33 - 0:07:34::Oh, man.
0:07:34 - 0:07:36::Frank, you're enraging me.
0:07:36 - 0:07:38::Let me paint two scenarios for you.
0:07:38 - 0:07:40::There's a group of people.
0:07:40 - 0:07:42::That's okay, man, by the way.
0:07:42 - 0:07:43::There's a group of people.
0:07:43 - 0:07:45::You don't look enraged.
0:07:45 - 0:07:47::I'm just sleepy to be enraged.
0:07:47 - 0:07:49::I just show it, but I can feel it.
0:07:49 - 0:07:51::I can feel it in this belly.
0:07:51 - 0:07:53::Here, it gets hungry.
0:07:53 - 0:07:55::Hulk style.
0:07:55 - 0:07:59::Okay, what it sounds more fun to you, dude.
0:07:59 - 0:08:02::Sitting in the back seat.
0:08:02 - 0:08:03::Stay awake.
0:08:03 - 0:08:05::Sitting in the back seat.
0:08:05 - 0:08:09::Rolls Royce.
0:08:09 - 0:08:11::Whatever.
0:08:11 - 0:08:13::Maybe in a big high school parking lot.
0:08:13 - 0:08:15::Listen to music or something.
0:08:15 - 0:08:17::New jibes.
0:08:17 - 0:08:19::Yeah, listen to new jibes.
0:08:19 - 0:08:21::Learning how to roll joint on the hood.
0:08:21 - 0:08:27::Practicing with tobacco over and over again in your dad's Rolls Royce.
0:08:27 - 0:08:29::Okay, what it sounds more fun?
0:08:29 - 0:08:31::That.
0:08:31 - 0:08:39::Or sitting on a rock a hundred feet in the air above the sea cliffs with a bunch of people who made knives out of rocks.
0:08:39 - 0:08:43::And you're slicing that fucking heads off a squid like the mother fucking cartel of the sea.
0:08:43 - 0:08:47::And everyone's laughing their asses out.
0:08:47 - 0:08:49::Okay.
0:08:49 - 0:08:51::Versus all I'm trying to be cool.
0:08:51 - 0:08:57::Make sure that I have my split rolling skills on point before I go watch the mid 90s.
0:08:57 - 0:08:59::I don't give a fuck.
0:08:59 - 0:09:01::By the way.
0:09:01 - 0:09:03::Yeah.
0:09:03 - 0:09:07::Well, the first situation just described describes in my mind what you would call a psycho knot.
0:09:07 - 0:09:09::You know what I'm saying?
0:09:09 - 0:09:11::Where you.
0:09:11 - 0:09:15::You are your venture is.
0:09:15 - 0:09:17::Happens in the mind, right?
0:09:17 - 0:09:25::And that can be precipitated by getting all fucked up on weed or getting fucked up on a weed and tobacco, which is what a split is, right?
0:09:25 - 0:09:31::So that's what I want to commend Eric if he gave me his vocabulary list for the week precipitate.
0:09:31 - 0:09:33::It was one on there.
0:09:33 - 0:09:39::I was like, did you use that right precipitate?
0:09:39 - 0:09:43::Is that a precipitate precipitate precipitate precipitate?
0:09:43 - 0:09:45::What's the kind of a vocabulary?
0:09:45 - 0:09:47::So what happens when you look at new words?
0:09:47 - 0:09:49::It's just precipitating.
0:09:49 - 0:09:51::Okay, that's after it doesn't exist.
0:09:51 - 0:09:53::And that word will never exist.
0:09:53 - 0:09:57::Stop trying to write every precipitate is then followed by a post-sipitate.
0:09:57 - 0:09:59::Spirits.
0:09:59 - 0:10:01::Okay.

0:10:00 - 0:10:02.780000::should make a water brand called Sypetate that has alcohol in it.

0:11:05.240000 - 0:11:09.020000::Well, what you don't know is that this shit's filled up

0:12:12.620000 - 0:12:17.620000::because most of it is spent starving, okay?
0:12:18.500000 - 0:12:20.260000::And looking for food.
0:12:20.260000 - 0:12:21.980000::So these people, these ancient,

0:19:07.620000 - 0:19:15.020000::Right. At night, you actually work on your real projects and you go that you're going down deep
0:19:15.020000 - 0:19:22.620000::into the internet and the dark web and all this. And you make special programs for people
0:19:22.620000 - 0:19:28.740000::and you sell them on a black market. And one night you're sleep at your you're listening to crazy
0:19:28.740000 - 0:19:34.660000::German based style techno and you fall asleep at your computers and there's a knock at the door.

0:19:41.460000 - 0:19:50.500000::a tattoo of a white rabbit. And you get a crazy message on your computer. They hop into your terminal
0:19:50.500000 - 0:19:54.820000::and they start typing to you and they say follow the white rabbit. And then you see this beautiful
0:19:54.820000 - 0:19:59.940000::rabbit on this beautiful woman. Do you believe this goes on for two hours? You

0:20:00 - 0:20:11::I would say I probably wouldn't follow that damn rabbit. You know what I'm saying? I probably would have children.
0:20:11 - 0:20:18::Are you serious? Hey, you know who would me? I would. You go to the Craigsick Club.
0:20:18 - 0:20:24::You go from programmer to freaky ass fucking club. Maybe I would.
0:20:24 - 0:20:32::Wait, wait, wait, let me redo it. I would follow the white rabbit. You wouldn't follow fucking Trinity. Oh, Trinity.
0:20:32 - 0:20:38::No, bro, but it's not Trinity that has the white rabbit to two. It's another woman who actually. Yeah, but you know deep down inside that
0:20:38 - 0:20:45::Trindies somewhere there. That's how fate works. Don't get me started on Trinity. Please. It's true love.
0:20:45 - 0:20:52::At this point in my life, I would follow a fucking Hasidic man into the depths of Brooklyn. I am so.
0:20:52 - 0:21:00::Well, yeah, you'd be doing that. What's it going to be? I need to live. I would let me get the Drew Binsky haircut for once in my fucking life.
0:21:00 - 0:21:09::And the complete. I just got the Drew Binsky haircut. No question. No, you know, you got the Drew Binsky haircut when he's in Afghanistan.
0:21:09 - 0:21:19::Who's Drew Binsky? Drew Binsky, Dr. Planet Earth. He's been to every single hundred ninety seven countries. He's got a YouTube channel where he goes.
0:21:19 - 0:21:30::And sometimes he goes to Kabul two days before a major terror event occurs. Okay. And he's been to all of them. But what I'm saying is I can't remember. God damn it. Put off your bingo list.
0:21:30 - 0:21:32::The terror event.
0:21:32 - 0:21:42::I'm not. Now. Now. Back to the May. Matrix. I'll back to what what's all right. So what I'm saying is. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Forget about it.
0:21:42 - 0:21:49::It takes nothing right now. If somebody's had to fucking a hot dog and said, want to see, you know what I'm saying? Walk up to me with a hot dog and say.
0:21:49 - 0:21:55::Want to see some some of the weirdest shit I got in my house or something. You see what I'm going with this where I'm like.
0:21:55 - 0:22:02::Why am I so desperate for something like that to happen? Because I was raised on a bed of lies. Here's what's going to happen to you.
0:22:02 - 0:22:09::Dude, you're going to be the brave little toaster when you're a little kid. You're going to go on an adventure. You're watching the iron giant. James in the giant peach.
0:22:09 - 0:22:19::You're going to get sucked into some fruit with some bug dudes. Then you grow up. You grow up. But you've been trained incorrectly to think that life is extravagant.
0:22:19 - 0:22:29::When really the mind is what's extravagant. Life is quite mundane compared to what you can sit and imagine in your house. Let me imagine something right now.
0:22:29 - 0:22:43::Oh, wow. I have a castle. How cool is that? In reality. I have to knock a goblet. That's pretty good.
0:22:43 - 0:22:57::I don't know where this is from. Yeah, well, it's just from the Madonna and gone. That's a nice cut. Where's the Madonna and our goblet? Sorry. This is in San Luis, a little beast boat. I don't know how to say.
0:22:57 - 0:23:09::San Luis, a beast bowl. Yeah. Wait, can I share a factoid about the matrix that I don't that I'm not sure if it is correct. This is a behind the scenes.
0:23:09 - 0:23:23::I don't know if it's true. So if somebody's like a fucking matrix historian, which something tells me that there is someone like that listening right now correct me if I'm wrong.
0:23:23 - 0:23:38::So you know that opening scene right or turned me is you know the cops come in and she kind of floats up whatever and does that that that iconic camera move that 360 goes around.
0:23:38 - 0:23:51::She's so they got the money that was chalce keys got the money for to make the matrix and they blew it all on that fucking one sequence. And then they went back to the studio.
0:23:51 - 0:24:04::And they said, Hey, we need more money. That's so to show them how sick that was the movie is going to be that is I don't know if that's true, but that's like that that's true. That's awesome.
0:24:04 - 0:24:19::That is so fucking sick. That's it. We do that with like a minute like comedy scene and there's there's like a fucking like a crazy. They're like no, you're you're blacklisted from Hollywood.
0:24:19 - 0:24:35::Oh, this is what I was cooking on earlier is that you know when I was a kid, the matrix just seemed like I was like, Oh, this is what life is like in the cities. It's dark.
0:24:35 - 0:24:45::There's real people that you don't understand all right, you know what I mean, and I feel like the internet has sort of like softwashed everybody now everybody's too little too accessible.
0:24:45 - 0:24:55::You realize that everybody's normal and everybody has the same fears and anxieties and we're actually all kind of the same. I miss when they were kind of cool people out there that kind of frightened me.
0:24:55 - 0:25:00::You know what I mean, wow, what the hell is your life all about you, you live in a way that you're not going to be able to do anything.

0:25:00 - 0:25:05.060000::That's cool and exciting and dark and at this point I feel like I don't know if those
0:25:05.840000 - 0:25:09.680000::Maybe I just need to go and meet those people maybe they live in different countries
0:25:09.680000 - 0:25:11.680000::Maybe you need to push
0:25:11.920000 - 0:25:13.120000::further
0:25:13.120000 - 0:25:15.620000::Maybe you need to push further because
0:25:18.040000 - 0:25:21.640000::The truth is that everybody has that side of them
0:25:23.280000 - 0:25:29.880000::You just have to look deeper for some a dark side and you just have to look deeper for some
0:25:30.080000 - 0:25:34.960000::Yes, you do I can tell from you demeanor and what what type of look are you had last night?
0:25:35.680000 - 0:25:38.800000::Dark Eric so you sometimes you see a boring person
0:25:40.320000 - 0:25:42.320000::And you think wow this is the most
0:25:46.520000 - 0:25:48.520000::You wouldn't like to see me dark would you?
0:25:50.040000 - 0:25:52.040000::Light Eric versus dark Eric
0:25:54.480000 - 0:25:56.760000::Wow, no one would like to see the
0:25:56.760000 - 0:26:02::Like a incredible anime dark radio dark the dark radio
0:26:03.160000 - 0:26:08.320000::Paddling inside the forces of good and evil mm-hmm, and I would set that in the Narnia universe
0:26:08.400000 - 0:26:10.400000::It'd be like a spin off
0:26:10.600000 - 0:26:14.960000::A lot of your ideas are kind of hard to produce, but they're really good right
0:26:17.600000 - 0:26:21.800000::Everything has to be in Narnia or like Narnia a million dollar IP. Yeah
0:26:21.800000 - 0:26:26.120000::Yeah, all right let's do that, but it's on the death star
0:26:28.440000 - 0:26:32.480000::If you were somehow like a North Korea style production company owner
0:26:33.280000 - 0:26:37.960000::And you could like people were taking meetings with you like please you have so much fucking money infinite power

0:31:55.280000 - 0:31:59.280000::they were hiking on the same trail that me and Max went on last week
0:31:59.280000 - 0:32:02.280000::and they're walking up this steep ass trail
0:32:02.280000 - 0:32:04.280000::and uh...
0:32:04.280000 - 0:32:07.280000::all of a sudden there's a rattlesnake in the middle of the trail
0:32:07.280000 - 0:32:10.280000::and how he goes and bites this rattlesnake on the head
0:32:10.280000 - 0:32:11.280000::oh no
0:32:11.280000 - 0:32:16.280000::so the rattlesnake is in how he's mouth and he's like shaking around blood spurting everywhere
0:32:16.280000 - 0:32:19.280000::and they took how he did it how he's fine
0:32:19.280000 - 0:32:21.280000::no but I'm got in him
0:32:21.280000 - 0:32:23.280000::but that's fucking crazy
0:32:23.280000 - 0:32:27.280000::but we need that we need a guns to protect ourselves from shit like this
0:32:27.280000 - 0:32:29.280000::hmm
0:32:29.280000 - 0:32:34.280000::sorry about that yeah totally
0:32:34.280000 - 0:32:39.280000::well we need different types of guns like guns with like cannon style wider bullets
0:32:39.280000 - 0:32:42.280000::because the accuracy that you need
0:32:42.280000 - 0:32:45.280000::I have the accuracy because I'm always going you know
0:32:45.280000 - 0:32:50.280000::I have a lot of you Instagram style safety mentors that are teaching me how to
0:32:50.280000 - 0:32:54.280000::but yeah a lot of people couldn't shoot a snake with a bullet
0:32:54.280000 - 0:32:57.280000::to save their lives or their dogs life
0:32:57.280000 - 0:33:01.280000::now if they had fat bullets big wide bullets
0:33:01.280000 - 0:33:04.280000::and maybe they expand after coming out of the gun
0:33:04.280000 - 0:33:06.280000::does that exist yet? That's a very good idea
0:33:06.280000 - 0:33:12.280000::well you put a little water on it like you put on those washcloths that shrink down to like the size of a sugar cube
0:33:12.280000 - 0:33:15.280000::and then it grows into a giant washcloth
0:33:15.280000 - 0:33:18.280000::great so you just need to spit in the back of the
0:33:18.280000 - 0:33:20.280000::so you got to spit before you shoot
0:33:20.280000 - 0:33:24.280000::I think that's how some bullets work they enter in you like this
0:33:24.280000 - 0:33:28.280000::and then if you look in the back it expands out
0:33:28.280000 - 0:33:30.280000::and then it broke
0:33:30.280000 - 0:33:34.280000::military technology weapons technology
0:33:34.280000 - 0:33:36.280000::so it's cool when we were kids
0:33:36.280000 - 0:33:38.280000::no it's fucked up

0:33:40.280000 - 0:33:42.280000::it's being used for weapons manufacturer
0:33:42.280000 - 0:33:46.280000::turn this off right now and go get some help
0:33:46.280000 - 0:33:50.280000::if you ever came up with an idea for a gun or a bullet or a bomb
0:33:50.280000 - 0:33:54.280000::take yourself to the closest river and see if you could drink the whole thing
0:33:54.280000 - 0:33:58.280000::okay you know what we need to discuss is the new

0:35:29.800000 - 0:35:31.960000::I think it really is.
0:35:31.960000 - 0:35:34.920000::So, John, this man, the second whistleblower

0:35:40.480000 - 0:35:41.360000::infection.
0:35:41.360000 - 0:35:42.200000::How fast?
0:35:42.200000 - 0:35:44::Oh, interesting.
0:35:44 - 0:35:44.840000::You know what that is?
0:35:44.840000 - 0:35:47.080000::That's a drone B that is infected.

0:35:54.960000 - 0:35:55.880000::You, you man.
0:35:55.880000 - 0:35:56.960000::Why do they gotta go so fast?

0:36:28 - 0:36:30.080000::is like caked out of their mind?
0:36:30.080000 - 0:36:32.640000::Like fucking like there's gotta be one cake to,
0:36:32.640000 - 0:36:34.960000::there's gotta be one person who's got two million

0:36:38.640000 - 0:36:39.640000::And they're pirating it.
0:36:39.640000 - 0:36:40.800000::I bet they're pirating.
0:36:40.800000 - 0:36:42.680000::It's one of the Jake.
0:36:42.680000 - 0:36:43.760000::It'll be one of the Jake's.
0:36:43.760000 - 0:36:46.040000::I know anybody's ever pirated this shit.
0:36:46.040000 - 0:36:47.840000::I would, I would be a little bit impressed
0:36:47.840000 - 0:36:48.680000::if that was a good,
0:36:48.680000 - 0:36:51.800000::I'd be a little honored if someone pirated this.
0:36:51.800000 - 0:36:52.640000::The Pirate.
0:36:52.640000 - 0:36:53.640000::The MP3.
0:36:53.640000 - 0:36:56.040000::Yeah, well, they can just send the YouTube link
0:36:56.120000 - 0:36:57.840000::because it's just, you know,
0:36:57.840000 - 0:36:59.480000::you only need one friend and a friend group
0:36:59.480000 - 0:37:02.040000::to have the YouTube link and then you just send it around
0:37:02.040000 - 0:37:03.840000::for the Patreon episodes.
0:37:03.840000 - 0:37:04.960000::There's probably a friend that does that
0:37:04.960000 - 0:37:06.120000::sends it to the group text
0:37:06.120000 - 0:37:08.120000::and no one ever fucking clicks on it.
0:37:08.120000 - 0:37:11.320000::No, that's not possible because you become cool.
0:37:11.320000 - 0:37:13.880000::And I guess you become very cool.
0:37:13.880000 - 0:37:14.720000::Right.
0:37:14.720000 - 0:37:15.720000::Max Kebel.
0:37:15.720000 - 0:37:17.400000::So here's what I'm gonna say.
0:37:17.400000 - 0:37:18.240000::Yeah.
0:37:18.240000 - 0:37:20.240000::Max Kebel's, Kebel's big move.

0:37:24.840000 - 0:37:26.440000::That's not, not anymore.
0:37:26.440000 - 0:37:27.440000::Not anymore.
0:37:27.440000 - 0:37:28.280000::All right.
0:37:28.280000 - 0:37:29.360000::I see adult version.
0:37:30.360000 - 0:37:31.520000::Make friends cool.
0:37:31.520000 - 0:37:33.600000::That was in Max Kebel's big move.
0:37:33.600000 - 0:37:34.680000::Biggest move.
0:37:34.680000 - 0:37:35.520000::He was.
0:37:36.720000 - 0:37:38.360000::She interesting, man.

0:37:39.320000 - 0:37:41.080000::I didn't see any women in that movie.
0:37:41.080000 - 0:37:43.040000::So that's why assumptions.
0:37:43.040000 - 0:37:44.440000::There are none in that movie.
0:37:44.440000 - 0:37:45.360000::I'm pretty sure.
0:37:46.640000 - 0:37:47.480000::I'll watch it.
0:37:47.480000 - 0:37:49.600000::I can't help but I want to say to me, man.
0:37:49.600000 - 0:37:51.440000::Oh, funny, you'd ask.
0:37:51.440000 - 0:37:54.600000::I just want to warn you now

0:38:03.720000 - 0:38:05::that only you know.
0:38:06.120000 - 0:38:09.240000::And if you're ever thinking about whistle blowing,
0:38:09.240000 - 0:38:12.720000::I just want you to know that you've already got a room
0:38:13.680000 - 0:38:17.080000::at the fucking Epcot Hotel and Disney World.
0:38:18.200000 - 0:38:20.400000::Anytime you want to start whistle blowing,
0:38:20.400000 - 0:38:23.560000::I got a nice vacation for you to go on, man.
0:38:23.560000 - 0:38:25.960000::And you're going to end up in that hotel room.
0:38:25.960000 - 0:38:26.960000::And guess what?
0:38:29.280000 - 0:38:30.800000::I can't say what's going to happen.
0:38:34.720000 - 0:38:39.960000::But it's going to be a must think of a most horrible way to go.
0:38:39.960000 - 0:38:41.520000::Should you whistle blow?
0:38:41.520000 - 0:38:43.120000::Should whistle and blow?
0:38:43.120000 - 0:38:45.120000::Those are both blowing.
0:38:45.120000 - 0:38:46.760000::That's what's going to blow.

0:38:48.560000 - 0:38:51.040000::What do you guys, you guys can never replace me.
0:38:52.040000 - 0:38:53.880000::We really couldn't.
0:38:53.880000 - 0:38:55.440000::Want a bet, dude?
0:38:55.440000 - 0:38:56.440000::I'll just say it like that.
0:38:56.440000 - 0:38:58.120000::We really turn off my zoom.
0:39:00.120000 - 0:39:03.160000::I got all the way to Disney Land with you guys

0:39:07.840000 - 0:39:10.920000::People think it's pathetic to be into Disney as an adult.
0:39:10.920000 - 0:39:12.680000::Well, well, well.
0:39:14.200000 - 0:39:15.640000::Why don't you get an interest?
0:39:15.640000 - 0:39:17.560000::You know, I mean, why don't you really care about something

0:39:25.520000 - 0:39:26.280000::October.

0:39:29.720000 - 0:39:31.800000::You guys think Disney is a little big on-line?
0:39:31.800000 - 0:39:34.320000::Let me play something for you guys real quick.
0:39:37.440000 - 0:39:38.960000::What is this?

0:39:42.560000 - 0:39:44.800000::Oh, you guys thought Disney's lame, did you?
0:39:45.480000 - 0:39:46.480000::I get a little bit of no sound.
0:39:48.480000 - 0:39:49.480000::All right, veterans.
0:39:51.120000 - 0:39:52.120000::Training veterans.
0:39:53.120000 - 0:39:54.720000::Sporting veterans.
0:39:59.200000 - 0:40:00.200000::Wow.

0:40:00 - 0:40:07.400000::That's Disney Disney supports hires and trains veterans. So you're saying Disney is the last place that any type of
0:40:07.920000 - 0:40:11.360000::Violent things that's in the door because that's right
0:40:11.680000 - 0:40:15.600000::Who's in the goofy costume is fucking seal team six? Yeah
0:40:17.120000 - 0:40:22.800000::Oh, I bet they do got them oozee's in some of those costumes. They got room for more than a oozee in there
0:40:22.800000 - 0:40:24.800000::Trust me sir. They got room for the whole team
0:40:25.200000 - 0:40:27.200000::Yeah, that's right. Oh shit

0:40:38 - 0:40:40::You heard of this right?
0:40:42.160000 - 0:40:44.160000::We're not your original every day against it
0:40:45.360000 - 0:40:51.520000::Well, let me say this there is a law that you are not allowed to fly in the airspace above Disney
0:40:52.320000 - 0:40:56::What are they what are they hiding? What's in there is an autonomous
0:40:56.800000 - 0:41:01.600000::Basically entity. It's like the Vatican of the United States, okay?
0:41:02.160000 - 0:41:08.800000::And what and if you fuck around when you go into Disney land Disney notice it's land world Disney world
0:41:09.440000 - 0:41:13.280000::When you go there you operate on their fucking rules if you get out of line
0:41:13.760000 - 0:41:19.280000::Guess what that's it instant they don't even go to they don't even go to detaining. It's instant torture
0:41:20 - 0:41:25.360000::You're getting tortured by fucking princess peach waterboarded by princess peach. Yo there
0:41:25.600000 - 0:41:27.600000::Nintendo bro

0:41:33.920000 - 0:41:41.200000::They got Pac-Man and they've got Johnny Darko. They've got everything. You think that there's no relation between princess peach and
0:41:41.840000 - 0:41:49.920000::The Disney princess. Well, dude. I apparently have much to learn um. Yeah, you do well. I it's curious to me that that
0:41:50.960000 - 0:41:53.840000::It would be a very convenient place to hide something very
0:41:56.320000 - 0:41:58.520000::Forbidden something is like a UFO
0:41:58.880000 - 0:42:06.320000::Mother shit put that underneath a giant theme park who's gonna dig down there nobody. It's too beloved. That's just never getting taken away
0:42:08.160000 - 0:42:13.360000::I think we need to do an investigative style report and try and do it in the
0:42:14 - 0:42:18.800000::And try and get in that jail and we have GoPro's on us and those glasses that
0:42:19.360000 - 0:42:21.360000::That are obviously have a camera in them
0:42:22.320000 - 0:42:28.160000::And we're gonna find out and expose Disney for what they fucking truly for what's actually going on
0:42:28.160000 - 0:42:30.720000::Yeah, we might die for it for it, but
0:42:31.680000 - 0:42:33.680000::Imagine this fit at Disneyland, okay
0:42:36.160000 - 0:42:41.920000::You got the Brooks running shoes on not the cool ones, okay the ones I wear then

0:43:23.680000 - 0:43:29.920000::That is a full Jason Bourne costume that you know what I mean that you can wear in there. Yeah, no one will question you
0:43:31.120000 - 0:43:37.120000::Uh put a little bit of axe chocolate on before little too much axe chocolate spray on and you can
0:43:37.120000 - 0:43:40.400000::Wipe any flavor. You don't remember axe chocolate

0:45:00 - 0:45:02.240000::Now, where is the creativity gone?
0:45:02.240000 - 0:45:03.680000::People do need to be punished.
0:45:03.680000 - 0:45:05.160000::They need to be held accountable.
0:45:05.160000 - 0:45:08.560000::But why don't you do it a bit creatively, right?
0:45:08.560000 - 0:45:09.400000::Right.
0:45:09.400000 - 0:45:11.720000::Somebody gets a car accident on purpose.
0:45:11.720000 - 0:45:12.960000::Yeah.
0:45:12.960000 - 0:45:18.760000::Well, you know there was a time like this, right?
0:45:18.760000 - 0:45:19.840000::That you're just driving.
0:45:19.840000 - 0:45:21.080000::It's called the medieval time.
0:45:21.080000 - 0:45:21.920000::The seven years.
0:45:21.920000 - 0:45:25.160000::I know, I just read that or listen to that book on tape
0:45:25.160000 - 0:45:25.960000::about the executioner.
0:45:25.960000 - 0:45:26.800000::What book?
0:45:26.800000 - 0:45:29.960000::It's called the Faithful Executioner, dude.
0:45:30.960000 - 0:45:31.960000::Cap.
0:45:34.200000 - 0:45:36.680000::And you know that band, the Iron Maiden, right?
0:45:36.680000 - 0:45:39::The Iron Fund.
0:45:39 - 0:45:41.360000::You thought that was a fun title.
0:45:41.360000 - 0:45:45.120000::Well, that's actually a medieval torture device.
0:45:45.120000 - 0:45:48.280000::That's a creative torture device.
0:45:48.280000 - 0:45:49.960000::Say what, dude?
0:45:49.960000 - 0:45:51.760000::So we got to make new torture devices.
0:45:51.760000 - 0:45:52.320000::How about this?
0:45:52.320000 - 0:45:54.200000::The size one, Yeezy's.
0:45:54.200000 - 0:45:55::You got to go.
0:45:58 - 0:45:58.920000::They're so small.
0:45:58.920000 - 0:45:59.760000::They'll kill you.
0:45:59.760000 - 0:46:02.320000::They explode your foot or something.
0:46:02.320000 - 0:46:06.880000::Well, I got a bone to pick with the Vans Skate Pro slide on.
0:46:06.880000 - 0:46:10.240000::They're too tight for any normal person's feet.
0:46:10.240000 - 0:46:13.880000::Have you had a length trying to get a bigger size?
0:46:13.880000 - 0:46:15.640000::I did try, bro.
0:46:15.640000 - 0:46:17::What, what?
0:46:17 - 0:46:18.440000::That's so shocking, man.
0:46:18.440000 - 0:46:19.760000::And it's so shocking, man.
0:46:19.760000 - 0:46:21.080000::Well, I know.
0:46:21.080000 - 0:46:22.080000::I know.
0:46:22.080000 - 0:46:25.360000::Well, and how much are these air, these Vans slides?
0:46:25.360000 - 0:46:26.800000::60 bucks.
0:46:26.800000 - 0:46:28.720000::You get what you pay for, man.
0:46:28.720000 - 0:46:29.760000::Wow.
0:46:29.760000 - 0:46:33.720000::Now, if those were common projects, those were 900.
0:46:33.720000 - 0:46:35.720000::Those were 900.
0:46:35.720000 - 0:46:36.520000::CPs.
0:46:36.520000 - 0:46:37.520000::Hilarious.
0:46:37.520000 - 0:46:39.400000::Very funny that you don't.
0:46:39.400000 - 0:46:40.960000::Common projects.
0:46:40.960000 - 0:46:44.600000::Common projects are a shoe brand that
0:46:44.600000 - 0:46:47.160000::are basically make the same types of shoes
0:46:47.160000 - 0:46:51.920000::that you're describing, except they're $900.
0:46:51.920000 - 0:46:54.840000::And I haven't tried on a pair ever.
0:46:54.840000 - 0:46:58.080000::But I would assume that that $900 gets you
0:46:58.080000 - 0:47:01.200000::a little extra comfort.
0:47:01.200000 - 0:47:02.760000::Because you get what you pay for.
0:47:02.760000 - 0:47:03.800000::Like what my dad does.
0:47:03.800000 - 0:47:05.680000::Common projects.
0:47:05.680000 - 0:47:07.680000::I might look it up now.
0:47:07.680000 - 0:47:09.240000::You get what you pay for.
0:47:09.240000 - 0:47:13.800000::That brings me right back to the discussion with the rich.
0:47:13.800000 - 0:47:15.520000::Here's my question.
0:47:15.520000 - 0:47:17.560000::I've been meaning to ask you guys this.
0:47:17.560000 - 0:47:19.240000::You've been avoiding it.
0:47:19.240000 - 0:47:21.400000::Please answer this.
0:47:21.400000 - 0:47:27.840000::Is money wealth?
0:47:27.840000 - 0:47:29.760000::Did she really think about that?
0:47:29.760000 - 0:47:31.440000::These shoes look awful.
0:47:31.440000 - 0:47:32.440000::All right.
0:47:32.440000 - 0:47:33.440000::I would say no.
0:47:33.440000 - 0:47:34.960000::Is money wealth?
0:47:34.960000 - 0:47:36::Is money wealth?
0:47:36 - 0:47:38.560000::I would say no.
0:47:38.560000 - 0:47:39.240000::Why?
0:47:39.240000 - 0:47:41.520000::No, what's wealth is friendship.
0:47:41.520000 - 0:47:44.440000::What's wealth is happiness.
0:47:44.440000 - 0:47:49.400000::What's wealth is giving back and giving without anything
0:47:49.400000 - 0:47:51.160000::in return, Eric.
0:47:51.160000 - 0:47:54.800000::It's a poor people thing.
0:47:54.800000 - 0:47:55.880000::Should we kill the poor?
0:47:55.880000 - 0:47:59.120000::I forgot to ask.
0:47:59.120000 - 0:48:00.920000::You mean eat the richer, eat the poor?
0:48:00.920000 - 0:48:03.160000::Yeah.
0:48:03.160000 - 0:48:06.600000::Because what's funny is, you've got to eat everybody
0:48:06.600000 - 0:48:08.760000::to get ahead in this discussion.
0:48:08.760000 - 0:48:11.840000::If you think that's the case, do you
0:48:11.840000 - 0:48:17.800000::think that there is a spiritual bank and a spiritual economy
0:48:17.800000 - 0:48:22.040000::where really, because the rich people, they're not so rich.
0:48:22.040000 - 0:48:24.720000::They're not so wealthy as we've just learned from Nate,
0:48:24.720000 - 0:48:27.280000::people who have the most money, they don't have the most
0:48:27.280000 - 0:48:29.120000::happy, suit him saying.
0:48:29.120000 - 0:48:32.640000::So really, are there people who are incredibly happy right now
0:48:32.640000 - 0:48:35.120000::in Rancho Cucamango with their kids jumping up and down
0:48:35.120000 - 0:48:37.720000::on the trampoline, playing the George Lopez theme song
0:48:37.720000 - 0:48:42.600000::over and over again, eating fucking possible meat hot dogs?
0:48:42.600000 - 0:48:47.120000::What are they taking happiness out of the dark matter
0:48:47.120000 - 0:48:50.960000::of the universe and not letting other people be happy?
0:48:50.960000 - 0:48:53.320000::Do we need to eat them?
0:48:53.320000 - 0:48:54.120000::See what I'm saying?
0:48:54.160000 - 0:48:56.440000::Because talk about karma, if every action bounces off
0:48:56.440000 - 0:49:01.520000::of another action emotionally and positively and independently.
0:49:01.520000 - 0:49:03.480000::Is there a carmically just not enough?
0:49:03.480000 - 0:49:05.240000::Is there not enough happiness to go around?
0:49:05.240000 - 0:49:08.280000::Only so many people can be so happy.
0:49:08.280000 - 0:49:09.680000::It's quite possible.
0:49:09.680000 - 0:49:10.920000::Think about it this way.
0:49:10.920000 - 0:49:14.760000::When you're in a room with somebody and they're afraid,
0:49:14.760000 - 0:49:18.400000::that tends to make you unafraid, correct?
0:49:18.400000 - 0:49:19.600000::Why does that happen?
0:49:19.600000 - 0:49:22.640000::If you're depressed and you go around somebody who's more depressed,
0:49:22.640000 - 0:49:26.080000::suddenly you become a little even less depressed.
0:49:26.080000 - 0:49:27.400000::What's that about?
0:49:27.400000 - 0:49:28.240000::So now if somebody's happy.
0:49:28.240000 - 0:49:33.880000::Think that there's a sort of interdimensional,
0:49:33.880000 - 0:49:36.480000::emotional balance.
0:49:36.480000 - 0:49:38.720000::Uh-huh.
0:49:38.720000 - 0:49:41.240000::It's something I'd like to at least discuss before my time
0:49:41.240000 - 0:49:42.680000::is up on Earth.
0:49:42.680000 - 0:49:47.840000::This is, I don't think this has been suggested before, man.
0:49:47.840000 - 0:49:49.680000::Well, what happens when you go see a movie and everybody
0:49:49.680000 - 0:49:52.320000::is sad as fuck after the main character does at the end?
0:49:52.320000 - 0:49:55.080000::Well, what's happening in the movie right next to that?
0:49:55.080000 - 0:49:57.080000::Don't think it's coincident to the eyes of a TV
0:49:57.080000 - 0:49:59.360000::glows playing right next to the weekend or whatever
0:49:59.360000 - 0:49:59.880000::it's called.

0:50:00 - 0:50:03.360000::I'm saying go look in your local local movie
0:50:11.040000 - 0:50:13.040000::It's getting harder by the episode
0:50:14.560000 - 0:50:18.400000::As we dive deeper into the molecular structure of
0:50:19.680000 - 0:50:25.840000::We are this is by the way. This is not this is not episodic this podcast. This is serialized
0:50:26.400000 - 0:50:28.080000::So if you're jumping in right now
0:50:28.080000 - 0:50:33.600000::Yeah, you're going to be very confused when we start dissecting the molecules of happiness and into universal balance
0:50:34.160000 - 0:50:36.160000::Of course
0:50:36.400000 - 0:50:43.120000::The surface level years and years ago in the episode where we talk about read whatever you think it's about burritos, but it's not
0:50:44.480000 - 0:50:50.480000::No, and if anybody says the word burrito to me again like it sounds like frankly because I will not
0:50:51.280000 - 0:50:54.240000::Be categorized is just someone who loves burritos like
0:50:55.200000 - 0:51:00::You're not much more than that, but I did have an amazing. Oh, this is what gave me joy
0:51:00.800000 - 0:51:04.640000::I had to jump it so quick, but I went to tacos delta
0:51:05.440000 - 0:51:07.440000::Now if you watch
0:51:07.440000 - 0:51:12.880000::The christ pie delta pine is no bro. It's called tacos delta in silver lake
0:51:13.920000 - 0:51:18.640000::And if you watch the christ pie in interview where he's now going around promoting his movie pool man
0:51:19.600000 - 0:51:24.800000::He is going to some famed LA institutions and one of them is taco tacos delta
0:51:25.680000 - 0:51:30.640000::Now his tip is to get a breakfast burrito two eggs scrambled one egg over easy
0:51:31.040000 - 0:51:34.320000::So you let the egg go kind of be a little sauce in the burrito
0:51:34.880000 - 0:51:36.880000::Which is sort of discussed me somehow
0:51:37.440000 - 0:51:39.440000::but I go to tacos delta
0:51:40.080000 - 0:51:46.640000::the other night and I see the california burrito and I and I also see birria on the menu
0:51:47.360000 - 0:51:53.360000::But I don't see birria listed as an option for the california burrito and I said sir could I have birria
0:51:54 - 0:51:56.400000::In the california burrito and he said
0:51:57.440000 - 0:51:59.440000::It's never been done before
0:51:59.440000 - 0:52:01.360000::It's not we're not supposed to do that
0:52:01.360000 - 0:52:05.520000::But you know it that sounds kind of good so I'll let you try it and you got to come back and report to me
0:52:05.920000 - 0:52:08.960000::If it's good or not and then maybe we'll put it on the menu
0:52:09.600000 - 0:52:11.600000::See what I'm saying
0:52:11.920000 - 0:52:15.760000::I try this burrito with birria in it beef birria
0:52:16.720000 - 0:52:18.240000::It was fucking delicious dude

0:52:31.280000 - 0:52:33.520000::The rhailya that's right
0:52:36.080000 - 0:52:38.080000::The rhailyan burrito
