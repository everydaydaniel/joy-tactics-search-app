0:01:15.880000 - 0:01:21.360000::And they just kind of just are unconscious and maybe it played in the up next kind of
0:01:21.360000 - 0:01:22.680000::thing on Spotify.

0:01:44.920000 - 0:01:46.120000::I looked at my weird thing.
0:01:46.120000 - 0:01:47.400000::What are we going to talk about today?
0:01:47.400000 - 0:01:49.760000::We've talked about so much before.
0:01:49.760000 - 0:01:51.280000::And now we have another episode to do.
0:01:51.280000 - 0:01:52.960000::We need a new topic.
0:01:52.960000 - 0:01:56.440000::Well, I looked at my window and what do I see?
0:01:56.440000 - 0:02:04.280000::Rain as far as I can tell outside.
0:02:04.280000 - 0:02:04.880000::Yeah.
0:02:04.880000 - 0:02:07.240000::There's at least been rain out here as well.
0:02:07.240000 - 0:02:08.560000::Oh, just saw a drop.
0:02:08.560000 - 0:02:11.240000::So yeah, it's still raining.
0:02:11.240000 - 0:02:16::Now, my question is, are you feeling different today
0:02:16 - 0:02:17.400000::because of the rain?
0:02:17.400000 - 0:02:18.760000::Are you feeling sad?
0:02:18.760000 - 0:02:20.560000::Are you feeling gloomy?
0:02:20.560000 - 0:02:21.880000::Or no?
0:02:21.880000 - 0:02:25.200000::Are you blaming that feeling on the rain?
0:02:25.200000 - 0:02:26.800000::Is your life in shambles?
0:02:26.800000 - 0:02:30.200000::And now you have a convenient excuse
0:02:30.200000 - 0:02:32.240000::as to why you're feeling bad.
0:02:32.240000 - 0:02:34.880000::I was bought in the rain.
0:02:34.880000 - 0:02:36.280000::You're oh, oh, oh, oh.
0:02:36.280000 - 0:02:38.520000::Oh, the rain launched me.
0:02:38.520000 - 0:02:40.920000::The rain.
0:02:40.920000 - 0:02:42.120000::Remember, rain?
0:02:42.120000 - 0:02:44.240000::Does he say fire when he does it?
0:02:44.240000 - 0:02:45.200000::Darkness.
0:02:45.200000 - 0:02:47.200000::He says it's darkness.
0:02:47.200000 - 0:02:49.320000::What's the reason why he was all this Batman?
0:02:49.320000 - 0:02:50.840000::No, just Bane.
0:02:50.840000 - 0:02:53.440000::For the last 12 years.
0:02:53.440000 - 0:02:55.800000::That's what Bane sounds like.
0:02:55.800000 - 0:02:57.680000::Of course, yeah, of course he sounds like that.
0:02:57.680000 - 0:02:58.680000::A man.
0:02:58.680000 - 0:02:59.520000::Yeah, right.
0:02:59.520000 - 0:03:01.520000::Like a little British man, kind of.
0:03:01.520000 - 0:03:03.080000::Well, I was born.
0:03:03.080000 - 0:03:05.080000::Man, I was doing that shit.
0:03:05.080000 - 0:03:07.080000::I was like, I never thought I was good at impressions
0:03:07.080000 - 0:03:08.640000::and then Dark Knight rises came out.
0:03:08.640000 - 0:03:10.280000::And I was like, oh, fuck.
0:03:10.280000 - 0:03:13.680000::I believe I have a new talent.
0:03:13.680000 - 0:03:17.360000::And my friends were liking it as far as I could tell.
0:03:17.360000 - 0:03:22.320000::And then in our period, in our friendship, I remember.
0:03:22.320000 - 0:03:24.640000::When I was doing the Bane voice.
0:03:24.640000 - 0:03:25.640000::Yeah.
0:03:25.640000 - 0:03:26.640000::When you.
0:03:26.640000 - 0:03:28.760000::Damn.
0:03:28.760000 - 0:03:31.200000::To know someone's in a mental crisis,
0:03:31.200000 - 0:03:33.120000::just whenever they're bringing the Bane voice out.
0:03:33.120000 - 0:03:34.120000::Mm-hmm.
0:03:37.720000 - 0:03:40::Well, like a rainy day.
0:03:40 - 0:03:45.440000::In the rain yesterday for probably 30 minutes or so.
0:03:45.440000 - 0:03:47.760000::You were stuck in it doing outside.
0:03:47.760000 - 0:03:48.920000::I was commuting.
0:03:48.920000 - 0:03:50.960000::And it was simply pouring the whole time.
0:03:50.960000 - 0:03:53.840000::I thought, maybe I'll wait to see if it passes.
0:03:53.840000 - 0:03:56.160000::This two shall pass as they say.
0:03:56.160000 - 0:03:59.480000::Vesopra yet, as they say in Russian.
0:03:59.480000 - 0:04:00.520000::Maybe.
0:04:00.520000 - 0:04:02.440000::And guess what?
0:04:02.440000 - 0:04:03.720000::It didn't pass.
0:04:03.720000 - 0:04:06.640000::And I had no choice but to go into it.
0:04:06.640000 - 0:04:09.280000::And the experience was shocking.
0:04:09.280000 - 0:04:13.600000::It was at first shocking because it was cold and wet.
0:04:13.600000 - 0:04:15.840000::And I thought, well, I don't have the shoes for this.
0:04:15.840000 - 0:04:18.920000::I don't have galoshes on by any means.
0:04:18.920000 - 0:04:22.480000::And so then my socks started to get a little wet.
0:04:22.480000 - 0:04:23.720000::But then as the minutes went by.
0:04:23.720000 - 0:04:25.520000::Oh, that's the worst.
0:04:25.520000 - 0:04:26.320000::It was the worst.
0:04:26.320000 - 0:04:28.400000::But then as the minutes went by, I started to think,
0:04:28.400000 - 0:04:30.160000::you know what?
0:04:30.160000 - 0:04:31.480000::It's just water.
0:04:31.480000 - 0:04:33.280000::And it's totally fine.
0:04:33.280000 - 0:04:34.080000::So I.
0:04:34.080000 - 0:04:38.560000::So then I came home and I, guys, I took my socks off
0:04:38.560000 - 0:04:40.240000::after that.
0:04:40.240000 - 0:04:41.960000::And where'd you throw them things?
0:04:41.960000 - 0:04:44.120000::Did you crumble them up in a corner?
0:04:44.120000 - 0:04:48.360000::Or did you let them dry out as we were taught recently?
0:04:48.360000 - 0:04:49.480000::We were taught.
0:04:49.480000 - 0:04:51.320000::What?
0:04:51.320000 - 0:04:53.800000::We're doing that homeic class for adults.
0:04:53.800000 - 0:04:57.800000::Oh, my school homeic electives.
0:04:57.800000 - 0:04:59.120000::Oh, that would be fun.
0:04:59.120000 - 0:05:03.360000::I do feel like I'm going to be a little bit more
0:05:03.360000 - 0:05:06.360000::more like a little bit more like a little bit more.

0:05:00 - 0:05:02.120000::I need that, not that bad.
0:05:02.120000 - 0:05:04.400000::I just need that to get an ego boost
0:05:04.400000 - 0:05:06.440000::because I'm already so good at that shit.
0:05:06.440000 - 0:05:09.520000::I want one of those, like, you know how they have those?
0:05:09.520000 - 0:05:12.640000::I don't think we ever did this,
0:05:12.640000 - 0:05:13.960000::but like, you know how,
0:05:13.960000 - 0:05:16.320000::it's kind of like a classic trope of home-ec,
0:05:16.320000 - 0:05:18.960000::where you get to take home like a baby,
0:05:18.960000 - 0:05:21.160000::like a electronic baby,
0:05:21.160000 - 0:05:23.840000::and then you get graded on like,
0:05:23.840000 - 0:05:24.840000::if it's a rock.
0:05:24.840000 - 0:05:26.920000::It's skills, electronic survives.
0:05:27.920000 - 0:05:29.640000::I bet the, the tech,
0:05:29.640000 - 0:05:34.720000::the baby tech for that has probably increased, you know,
0:05:34.720000 - 0:05:35.760000::immensely, right?
0:05:35.760000 - 0:05:36.920000::There's no way to age.
0:05:36.920000 - 0:05:39.600000::Remember when it is an egg sometimes,
0:05:39.600000 - 0:05:42::I just give you an egg with a face on it.
0:05:42 - 0:05:44.760000::That might have been your school and your classes.
0:05:44.760000 - 0:05:47.320000::Yeah, they're all this is widely, widely.
0:05:47.320000 - 0:05:48.720000::Well, maybe it was just that very,
0:05:48.720000 - 0:05:50.880000::the way you just pre-college type of school.
0:05:50.880000 - 0:05:52.680000::We're gonna give you guys an egg.
0:05:52.680000 - 0:05:55.720000::No, just to hold.
0:05:55.720000 - 0:05:57.760000::The teachers like fading out on oxy,
0:05:57.760000 - 0:05:59.760000::like has nothing.
0:05:59.760000 - 0:06:01.040000::Teachers don't do that.
0:06:01.040000 - 0:06:02.040000::Good to help you.
0:06:02.040000 - 0:06:04.040000::No, no, no, they don't.
0:06:05.160000 - 0:06:07.800000::That seems so fucking hard.
0:06:07.800000 - 0:06:10.600000::Even just having a cat in the house right now,
0:06:10.600000 - 0:06:15.080000::kind of like, God, why does responsibility weigh?
0:06:16.280000 - 0:06:21.280000::Right, I would like to test out before I actually have a kid.
0:06:21.440000 - 0:06:24.320000::I would like to have a test like that, you know what I'm saying?
0:06:24.360000 - 0:06:25.760000::Just to feel it out.
0:06:25.760000 - 0:06:29.600000::Maybe even for like two years, you know what I'm saying?
0:06:29.600000 - 0:06:32.040000::Just, all right, maybe you're crying right now.
0:06:32.040000 - 0:06:34.200000::Baby's crying, your single father, single father.
0:06:34.200000 - 0:06:35.720000::You go, what do you do?
0:06:35.720000 - 0:06:39.160000::Well, I would get up immediately and stop the podcast.
0:06:39.160000 - 0:06:43.120000::Because the wrong one comes first before anything.
0:06:43.120000 - 0:06:44.520000::No, dude.
0:06:44.520000 - 0:06:49.440000::You have F this child because now it is dependent on you.
0:06:49.440000 - 0:06:52.160000::And it will be dependent on others as long as it lives.
0:06:52.160000 - 0:06:55.120000::You let it cry until it passes out.
0:06:55.120000 - 0:06:56.480000::That's the way that I was really happy.
0:06:56.480000 - 0:06:59.440000::Tell me how to fucking parent my fucking child.
0:06:59.440000 - 0:07:00.400000::All right.
0:07:00.400000 - 0:07:03.960000::I know your ass is fucking you have you have the most fucked up kid
0:07:03.960000 - 0:07:04.720000::on the planet.
0:07:04.720000 - 0:07:10.200000::Like you're talking to me as like, yeah, I'm raising that like
0:07:10.200000 - 0:07:11.840000::Leon the professional type kid.
0:07:12.840000 - 0:07:14.280000::Your kids trying to find to kill you.
0:07:14.280000 - 0:07:16.160000::No, you're right though.
0:07:16.160000 - 0:07:20.840000::I would I actually learn this that you you're supposed to let the baby
0:07:20.840000 - 0:07:23.560000::cry at night time.
0:07:23.560000 - 0:07:28.840000::Like you're not supposed to go into the their bedroom and like
0:07:28.840000 - 0:07:30.960000::help them out if they are crying at night.
0:07:30.960000 - 0:07:33.760000::You just let them what kind of cry it out.
0:07:33.760000 - 0:07:38::Can you imagine the pure terror of being a baby an infant again?
0:07:38 - 0:07:40.400000::Jack, are you falling asleep?
0:07:40.400000 - 0:07:42.480000::No, me.
0:07:42.480000 - 0:07:43.680000::Why does it look like it?
0:07:43.680000 - 0:07:46.680000::I looked over at you and I couldn't I've never seen your eyes
0:07:46.680000 - 0:07:49.840000::be that heavy on this bug.
0:07:51.640000 - 0:07:55.040000::Yeah, that's just I usually am kind of like that.
0:07:55.040000 - 0:08:00.280000::No, I'm full of crazy energy at times.
0:08:00.280000 - 0:08:01.800000::What you just saying?
0:08:01.800000 - 0:08:04.240000::I was saying, can you imagine the terror of being a child?
0:08:04.240000 - 0:08:06.560000::You just get thrown into this existence.
0:08:06.560000 - 0:08:11.040000::And then you're shut in a dark room in a terrifying cage.
0:08:11.040000 - 0:08:14::Well, let me flip it to the next level who you barely know
0:08:14 - 0:08:16::are just right fucking two doors down.
0:08:16.640000 - 0:08:18.160000::Mine is a little bit two miles.
0:08:21.600000 - 0:08:23::Yeah, like you're filled up.
0:08:23 - 0:08:24.920000::You got fucking Gerber.
0:08:24.920000 - 0:08:27.600000::Fill a full of Gerber baby food.
0:08:27.600000 - 0:08:31.760000::Dude, I just read this about baby or actually didn't read it
0:08:31.760000 - 0:08:34.600000::but heard it from my friend who's a mother.
0:08:34.600000 - 0:08:37.040000::Gerber baby food is out.
0:08:37.040000 - 0:08:39.120000::Gerber baby food is open.
0:08:39.120000 - 0:08:39.960000::I believe that.
0:08:39.960000 - 0:08:43.600000::What's in is real foods for real food?
0:08:43.600000 - 0:08:45.880000::Like a no.
0:08:45.880000 - 0:08:49.960000::Baby birding like literal food, yogurt, blueberries,
0:08:49.960000 - 0:08:53.120000::sweet potatoes, little piece of chicken.
0:08:53.120000 - 0:08:54.800000::Oh, it just has to be like mashed up.
0:08:54.800000 - 0:08:55.800000::It's gonna kind of miss that.
0:08:55.800000 - 0:08:56.800000::It's like the problem, right?
0:08:56.800000 - 0:08:57.640000::They can't.
0:08:57.640000 - 0:09:00.520000::Well, they can still grind that shit down with our gums.
0:09:02.320000 - 0:09:04.160000::And then something there.
0:09:04.160000 - 0:09:05.080000::And you can suck on it too.
0:09:05.080000 - 0:09:06.520000::You can suck on anything down to liquid.
0:09:06.520000 - 0:09:07.360000::We've discussed that.
0:09:07.360000 - 0:09:09::I feel like, right.
0:09:09 - 0:09:11.600000::We've done a whole series on that.
0:09:11.600000 - 0:09:12.720000::Exact topic.
0:09:12.720000 - 0:09:13.600000::Rocksucking.
0:09:14.600000 - 0:09:17.400000::It's like the titty pop thing.
0:09:17.400000 - 0:09:19::How many licks do you take?
0:09:19 - 0:09:20.040000::See what I'm saying?
0:09:20.040000 - 0:09:21.640000::How many sucks does it say?
0:09:21.640000 - 0:09:22.640000::How many sucks does it say?
0:09:22.640000 - 0:09:25.240000::It takes suck on a rock down to liquid.
0:09:25.240000 - 0:09:28.840000::One, a tooth, remember him?
0:09:28.840000 - 0:09:30::The owl.
0:09:30 - 0:09:32.560000::Yeah, the impatient, yeah, impatient, lollipop owl.
0:09:32.560000 - 0:09:34.080000::That damn ass owl.
0:09:34.080000 - 0:09:35.680000::I remember seeing that owl on TV
0:09:35.680000 - 0:09:37::because it's an old-ass cartoon
0:09:37 - 0:09:39.240000::that they've just been running since the 70s.
0:09:39.240000 - 0:09:41.680000::And when I saw that owl, I felt like I've been born
0:09:41.680000 - 0:09:43.480000::in the wrong time because I liked the way
0:09:43.480000 - 0:09:46.920000::these 70s cartoons are drawn.
0:09:46.920000 - 0:09:49.480000::I was meant to be alive then.
0:09:49.480000 - 0:09:53.120000::Damn, I'm just got hungry for those titty roll pops.
0:09:53.120000 - 0:09:56.480000::The hungry, I guess, I don't know,
0:09:56.480000 - 0:09:59.320000::hungry is the damn fucking hungry one.
0:09:59.320000 - 0:10:00.120000::Titty pop.

0:10:00 - 0:10:04.880000::You understand what I'm saying Jack you get that right of course I
0:10:04.880000 - 0:10:08.200000::understand four single hot tamales
0:10:08.200000 - 0:10:12.560000::and a little mini taco
0:10:12.560000 - 0:10:19.360000::okay but back to the topic of the episode rainy days
0:10:19.360000 - 0:10:24.360000::rainy days what do you do rainy days are amazing there that's God giving a
0:10:24.360000 - 0:10:31.380000::design to take a break you can't till the fields today you can't harvest the
0:10:31.380000 - 0:10:35.680000::crops too wet why don't you stay inside by the fire and get caught up on
0:10:35.680000 - 0:10:41.440000::culture get caught up with yourself or with your family hop under the electric
0:10:41.440000 - 0:10:48.600000::blanket and rot in your bed and take it out on the world too for everybody
0:10:48.600000 - 0:10:53.200000::listening who's on suicide watch now a lot of people what do they say is the
0:10:53.200000 - 0:11:00.320000::highest rate of suicide people who 100 what what does that mean yeah I guess
0:11:00.320000 - 0:11:03.440000::what is one hundred what's the highest rate of suicide that would be a hundred
0:11:03.440000 - 0:11:09.600000::percent yeah yeah I don't know if that's a rate I guess it could be a rate
0:11:09.600000 - 0:11:14.720000::right a hundred times a second now because then it's infinite so you said you
0:11:14.720000 - 0:11:18.440000::asked what is the highest rate you mean do you mean where is the highest
0:11:18.440000 - 0:11:22.960000::rate no I don't know exactly how to phrase what I mean but it'll make sense
0:11:22.960000 - 0:11:27.440000::in context and I have the answer for it too it's more rhetorical than anything
0:11:27.440000 - 0:11:34::it's that the people who have nothing to blame on the external they have nothing
0:11:34 - 0:11:38.280000::to blame but the internal and that's when they turn in and that's when they
0:11:38.280000 - 0:11:47.480000::take revenge on themselves or society a little well no that's some different
0:11:47.880000 - 0:11:54.720000::so what I'm saying is rain can be very positive for the mentally unwell
0:11:56.720000 - 0:12:01::interesting it's grounding it's humanizing I'm not making that up
0:12:01 - 0:12:07.440000::it's like when I was to come out of the ground you know release I feel like I
0:12:07.440000 - 0:12:12.760000::blamed a lot on sunsets when I was afraid of the sunsets remember how those
0:12:12.760000 - 0:12:17.360000::would make me feel when I was what did it was crazy it's really the opposite to
0:12:17.360000 - 0:12:23.320000::because that's a thing of beauty I know but I was able every day around five or
0:12:23.320000 - 0:12:28.480000::six when I felt like I was you know ten miles outside of my own body I was able
0:12:28.480000 - 0:12:33.800000::to say it's just the sunset you know I'm saying right I didn't have to do the
0:12:33.800000 - 0:12:40.040000::work of blame huh you didn't blame putting blame I blamed the beautiful sunset
0:12:40.040000 - 0:12:44.360000::one of the most regular oh my god that we know of well Eric have you ever
0:12:44.360000 - 0:12:49.720000::considered this because what do you proclaim has fixed that I proclaim getting
0:12:49.720000 - 0:12:56.640000::good rest via the sea has been allowed by my sleep apnea treatment that's
0:12:56.640000 - 0:13:03.920000::right so now what's curious is of all things is that you are afraid of the
0:13:03.920000 - 0:13:08.720000::sunset back then because what happened what does the sunset imply it implies
0:13:08.720000 - 0:13:12.440000::going to sleep in here and it implies the time of suffocation that you were
0:13:12.440000 - 0:13:19.360000::experiencing oh almost quite interesting to conceive of a connection there that
0:13:19.360000 - 0:13:23.840000::is almost quite interesting the universe is telling us things in ways that you
0:13:23.840000 - 0:13:30.640000::have to that aren't obvious okay so we had to dig we had to dig pretty deep to
0:13:30.640000 - 0:13:35.240000::find that metaphor I know the answer is right there but I was just happy for
0:13:35.240000 - 0:13:40.520000::years trying to figure that out andlaughter gave that shit to me for free well
0:13:40.520000 - 0:13:46.880000::I think you will be charging you you can invoice me Jack I once I figure out
0:13:46.880000 - 0:13:54.280000::what that is someone over could I invoice you guys for yeah if I were to either
0:13:54.280000 - 0:14:00.160000::give you some great advice or you know help you out with something that
0:14:00.160000 - 0:14:03.960000::doesn't typically cost money as a friend would you be okay with me
0:14:03.960000 - 0:14:08.240000::invoicing you for if I give you some great advice and I was just like hey

0:14:12.080000 - 0:14:18.400000::that be okay now if we found out that you were very very near losing your
0:14:18.400000 - 0:14:25.920000::apartment or unable to eat or whatever I would be asking you to invoice me for
0:14:25.920000 - 0:14:29.720000::hell of things you know I'm saying and if I somehow got an hell of money oh
0:14:29.720000 - 0:14:33.720000::because then we can be begging you to invoice me dude you look great today why
0:14:33.720000 - 0:14:36.560000::aren't you invoice me for how the fucking good you look it was just a pleasure
0:14:36.560000 - 0:14:42.320000::to look at your face through the computer it's also a manners thing too
0:14:42.320000 - 0:14:47.120000::yeah because if you if you said hey man I just gave you some good advice kind of
0:14:47.120000 - 0:14:50.960000::hundred bucks now I'd be like who's this fucking guy get where does he get off
0:14:50.960000 - 0:14:55.160000::where what what is he wearing a gene jacket or something but if you sent me an
0:14:55.160000 - 0:15:01.640000::email with a PDF and a letter of recommendation from a friend

0:15:00 - 0:15:03.360000::even though you've already done your service.
0:15:03.360000 - 0:15:06.440000::Just saying how good of a fit you are to be a friend
0:15:06.440000 - 0:15:08.880000::and be giving advice in that regard
0:15:08.880000 - 0:15:10.480000::and you had a nice little headshot or something
0:15:10.480000 - 0:15:12.520000::a little stamp and a company name.
0:15:12.520000 - 0:15:14.240000::I'd say, God damn if I don't.
0:15:14.240000 - 0:15:15.880000::That's really, I'd love that.
0:15:16.920000 - 0:15:19.040000::And if that would incentivize you as well as a friend
0:15:19.040000 - 0:15:21.920000::because you don't do shit really, you know,
0:15:22.920000 - 0:15:25.080000::for us a lot personally.
0:15:25.080000 - 0:15:25.920000::Right.
0:15:25.920000 - 0:15:27.960000::Hold it to yourself so that you can get ahead of us.
0:15:28.920000 - 0:15:31.360000::Well, I haven't been paid, you know, like from my eyes.
0:15:31.360000 - 0:15:34.400000::So, you know, that's how I would give you a lot more
0:15:34.400000 - 0:15:35.760000::if you guys were paying me.
0:15:35.760000 - 0:15:37.360000::That's for sure.
0:15:37.360000 - 0:15:39.320000::Here, I wanted to bring this up.
0:15:39.320000 - 0:15:41.560000::My friend works at Microsoft, okay?
0:15:41.560000 - 0:15:43.200000::Okay.
0:15:43.200000 - 0:15:44.200000::Yeah.
0:15:44.200000 - 0:15:46.760000::When did you meet someone like that?
0:15:46.760000 - 0:15:48.600000::That's awesome.
0:15:48.600000 - 0:15:51.720000::Through, you know, through my networking events,
0:15:51.720000 - 0:15:52.960000::I've been attending.
0:15:52.960000 - 0:15:54.680000::I've been meeting a lot of different people
0:15:54.680000 - 0:15:56.400000::in various industries.
0:15:56.800000 - 0:15:57.800000::Don't spoil it.
0:15:57.800000 - 0:15:59.040000::Why LinkedIn connections?
0:15:59.040000 - 0:16:01.280000::Are you, you're sneaking in as like a custodian,
0:16:01.280000 - 0:16:03.720000::just like doing way more work than you need to
0:16:03.720000 - 0:16:04.560000::to be there?
0:16:06.560000 - 0:16:07.400000::Okay.
0:16:07.400000 - 0:16:08.400000::Your friend works at Microsoft.
0:16:08.400000 - 0:16:09.840000::So, yeah, my friend works at Microsoft.
0:16:09.840000 - 0:16:13.280000::And after 10 years, if you work at a company for 10 years,
0:16:13.280000 - 0:16:16.520000::you get what's called a sabbatical.
0:16:16.520000 - 0:16:21.520000::And you can take off, I believe, like eight weeks
0:16:21.720000 - 0:16:23.400000::or two months or something like that.
0:16:23.760000 - 0:16:27.880000::You get just time off paid, okay?
0:16:27.880000 - 0:16:31.640000::Now, why can't we apply that to friendship?
0:16:31.640000 - 0:16:34.400000::Why can't we treat friendships like businesses?
0:16:34.400000 - 0:16:38.480000::Where maybe the 10 years that we've been friends,
0:16:38.480000 - 0:16:41.240000::maybe I need two months of it.
0:16:41.240000 - 0:16:42.600000::Oh, dude.
0:16:42.600000 - 0:16:44.240000::I know we've been playing that awesome trip,
0:16:44.240000 - 0:16:48.440000::but it's coming up on about eight years since I've known you.
0:16:50.120000 - 0:16:50.960000::I really didn't know.
0:16:50.960000 - 0:16:53.280000::I'm gonna be blocking your ass for a couple of months.
0:16:53.320000 - 0:16:57.160000::Friendships could benefit from some time apart, I think.
0:16:57.160000 - 0:17:00::Not that I'm saying it with you guys at all, okay?
0:17:00 - 0:17:01.760000::I'm not saying that at all.
0:17:01.760000 - 0:17:03.840000::In fact, I wanna spend more time with you guys.
0:17:03.840000 - 0:17:04.680000::Right.
0:17:05.680000 - 0:17:08.040000::If you've been friends with somebody for 10 years
0:17:08.040000 - 0:17:13.120000::and they have been draining you emotionally, financially,
0:17:13.120000 - 0:17:14.720000::and sexually.
0:17:14.720000 - 0:17:15.560000::It's actually?
0:17:15.560000 - 0:17:17.320000::Yeah, sexually as well.
0:17:17.320000 - 0:17:19.800000::I'm draining you sexually.
0:17:20.640000 - 0:17:24.240000::You deserve a couple of time off.
0:17:24.240000 - 0:17:27.040000::Some time off where you just like, let's just take a break
0:17:27.040000 - 0:17:29.800000::and it'll be fresh again.
0:17:29.800000 - 0:17:30.880000::Yeah.
0:17:30.880000 - 0:17:33::Is there a different option?
0:17:33 - 0:17:36.800000::If I'm like, hey Nate's been 10, I know I'm owed two months.
0:17:36.800000 - 0:17:38.960000::I'd be happy to take two months to go hang out
0:17:38.960000 - 0:17:42.840000::with some like Intermural Soccer Guy, Financial Bro Guys
0:17:42.840000 - 0:17:45.280000::and kind of live that life friendship wise for two months
0:17:45.280000 - 0:17:47.400000::or eight weeks or whatever.
0:17:47.400000 - 0:17:50.760000::Can I trade that in for like more,
0:17:50.760000 - 0:17:52.560000::like I'll keep being your friend for that two months
0:17:52.560000 - 0:17:54::but I get more out of it?
0:17:56.800000 - 0:17:59.800000::Like I hate this type of attitude.
0:17:59.800000 - 0:18:02.360000::The people that wanna substitute things at restaurants
0:18:02.360000 - 0:18:03.960000::is what you're talking about.
0:18:03.960000 - 0:18:04.800000::It's not one of those.
0:18:04.800000 - 0:18:08.560000::We're asking that is basically the analogy
0:18:08.560000 - 0:18:10.040000::that I'm gonna give you here.
0:18:10.040000 - 0:18:13.160000::You're saying, hey, it's not even on the menu dude
0:18:13.160000 - 0:18:15.920000::that you can substitute teartats for fraud.
0:18:15.920000 - 0:18:18.840000::You're asking the, just stick to the menu.
0:18:18.840000 - 0:18:20.880000::The menu is you get two months off, all right?
0:18:20.880000 - 0:18:21.880000::You can't hang out with me.
0:18:21.880000 - 0:18:24.680000::Yeah, but the problem is you're dealing
0:18:24.680000 - 0:18:27.680000::with a negotiator and entrepreneur and an innovator.
0:18:27.680000 - 0:18:30.800000::So, and I know that you in mind is so malleable,
0:18:30.800000 - 0:18:33.640000::especially from the standpoint of a salesman as myself.
0:18:33.640000 - 0:18:36.160000::So it'd be, right, right.
0:18:36.160000 - 0:18:41.160000::It'd be remissed to not, of mean to not try and negotiate
0:18:41.480000 - 0:18:43.880000::something better out of it for both of us.
0:18:43.880000 - 0:18:46.240000::And I wanna let you know that I respect that.
0:18:46.240000 - 0:18:50.240000::I respect that, but I disagree with your methodology.
0:18:52.880000 - 0:18:56.280000::If you guys ever negotiated a salary for real?
0:18:56.280000 - 0:18:57.120000::Yes.
0:18:57.120000 - 0:18:59.600000::You have Nate, when was this?
0:18:59.600000 - 0:19:04.120000::I was like trying to get, I was trying to get probably like,
0:19:04.120000 - 0:19:09.120000::it was like 20, maybe the offer was like $22 an hour,
0:19:09.360000 - 0:19:12.360000::which was a lot back in 2016.
0:19:14.880000 - 0:19:15.880000::Yeah.
0:19:15.880000 - 0:19:19.880000::And I was trying to get like 30 or till like $40 an hour.
0:19:21.240000 - 0:19:22.880000::This was at car.com.
0:19:22.880000 - 0:19:27.400000::Yeah, I like went into, I got hired to become a graphic designer
0:19:30.360000 - 0:19:31.200000::there.
0:19:31.200000 - 0:19:35.280000::So I went from like an account manager to the graphic design team,
0:19:35.280000 - 0:19:38.560000::which I had no, literally probably no experience
0:19:38.560000 - 0:19:40.040000::to be a graphic designer.
0:19:40.040000 - 0:19:41.680000::And they just hired you as.
0:19:41.680000 - 0:19:43.480000::Because you've been, you guys have seen my design.
0:19:43.480000 - 0:19:44.480000::Of course, dude.
0:19:44.480000 - 0:19:45.480000::Of course.
0:19:45.480000 - 0:19:47::The whole world has by now.
0:19:47 - 0:19:50.800000::Yeah, it's not car.com, but it's very, I'd like,
0:19:50.800000 - 0:19:52.920000::I'd drive a car that looked like that.
0:19:52.920000 - 0:19:56.280000::And how did they respond to you asking that?
0:19:56.280000 - 0:19:59.520000::I was like doing, I was like doing so much research.
0:19:59.520000 - 0:20:01::I was like, look,

0:20:00 - 0:20:05.320000::looking up all these YouTube tutorials on like how to negotiate a salary,
0:20:05.320000 - 0:20:09.680000::like what you should say, like I was like memorizing like scripts and stuff.
0:20:09.680000 - 0:20:11.400000::Like what do they say when you counter?
0:20:11.920000 - 0:20:17.880000::And I was imagining them to be like, floor, like no one's ever like came in with,
0:20:18.320000 - 0:20:21.320000::like these, this type of knowledge, these demands.
0:20:21.320000 - 0:20:26.460000::We thought we could take advantage of you and you have outsmarted us.
0:20:26.940000 - 0:20:32.500000::But it was, it was like, I didn't even get past like step one of the pro.
0:20:32.500000 - 0:20:36.300000::Like they were just like, nope, it's like 20 an hour and that's it.
0:20:36.300000 - 0:20:38.620000::Like we can't even, there's no budging at all.
0:20:38.620000 - 0:20:40.100000::Like you can't negotiate this.
0:20:40.620000 - 0:20:47.060000::And I was like, fuck, I had a whole like fucking like basically show that I was
0:20:47.060000 - 0:20:52.220000::going to put on like, I think it's harder when it's like an hourly rate versus
0:20:52.380000 - 0:20:52.900000::the salary.
0:20:52.900000 - 0:20:53.060000::Yeah.
0:20:53.900000 - 0:20:56.420000::You know, so I don't think that's
0:20:56.420000 - 0:20:57.420000::for lack of effort.
0:20:58.100000 - 0:21:01.860000::And if I were to hire you, Nate, I would pay you at least $28 an hour.
0:21:02.260000 - 0:21:03.300000::That's God.
0:21:03.300000 - 0:21:04.180000::I could cry right now.
0:21:04.180000 - 0:21:07.100000::That makes me that's that's really thoughtful of you.
0:21:07.100000 - 0:21:07.620000::Thank you.
0:21:07.820000 - 0:21:11.220000::When I got a job at I used to work at Discovery.
0:21:12.740000 - 0:21:15.340000::Communications Discovery Max.
0:21:15.500000 - 0:21:17.340000::But it was like this.
0:21:17.340000 - 0:21:19.220000::Yeah, Discovery Channel.
0:21:19.700000 - 0:21:20.860000::Oh, she's like their educate.
0:21:20.860000 - 0:21:22.100000::Remember when I got that job?
0:21:22.100000 - 0:21:23.620000::I do remember when I met you.
0:21:24.140000 - 0:21:28.580000::And my previous job, I had worked at this busted ass place.
0:21:28.580000 - 0:21:31.700000::I'll put this place on blast coupon cabin.
0:21:32.220000 - 0:21:36.780000::This was one of the most evil companies I can imagine.
0:21:37.140000 - 0:21:38.460000::They would hire us.
0:21:40.220000 - 0:21:44.860000::They hired all these like part-time workers and like would own wouldn't like let us
0:21:44.860000 - 0:21:48.460000::go above a certain amount of hours so we couldn't get like healthcare and stuff.
0:21:49.340000 - 0:21:53.500000::And we were getting paid like $12 an hour to write, basically fake.
0:21:53.900000 - 0:22:00.500000::It was like a bunch of monkeys like in a lab where they were like you guys are all SEO
0:22:00.500000 - 0:22:01.500000::experts.
0:22:01.500000 - 0:22:05.420000::And so we're going to have all these little ads that go on the internet for coupons.
0:22:05.700000 - 0:22:11.300000::And we need you to write at least like 250 characters or like 300 characters
0:22:11.620000 - 0:22:14.340000::and make up little stories about the ads and why it's fun.
0:22:14.700000 - 0:22:19.540000::And so every day I'd write like 40 ads, which would be only hung over to
0:22:20.020000 - 0:22:23.260000::Vart so hungover like check in the clock.
0:22:23.860000 - 0:22:25.380000::It's gone like two seconds.
0:22:26.220000 - 0:22:29.980000::Right in this horrible ad getting paid no money right out of college.
0:22:29.980000 - 0:22:33.100000::Like I was so unsure about my life at that point.
0:22:33.340000 - 0:22:35.020000::Anyway, so I did a whole year of that.
0:22:35.860000 - 0:22:39.140000::And they had these extravagant holiday parties too where like all the full-time
0:22:39.140000 - 0:22:41.100000::workers seem to be like millionaires to me.
0:22:41.660000 - 0:22:45.340000::And I was like cooking black beans on the stove every night.
0:22:45.540000 - 0:22:49.660000::Anyways, oh, this is what I would like to ask you Eric.
0:22:49.660000 - 0:22:56.740000::If you could go back and talk to that version of Eric, what would you say to him?
0:22:57.620000 - 0:23:01.420000::I would say what's curious is that you are in pain right now.
0:23:02.100000 - 0:23:07.020000::Life is difficult and your window is broken at home and it gets cold in the
0:23:07.020000 - 0:23:09.340000::winter and you don't have the wherewithal to fix it.
0:23:09.340000 - 0:23:14.780000::So you wear your sweats and sweatshirt to bed with a beanie on and extra extra socks.
0:23:15.900000 - 0:23:16.820000::That's now.
0:23:18.220000 - 0:23:24.740000::But if you change anything, you risk the fabric of time and space that will lead to one
0:23:24.740000 - 0:23:27.940000::of the most pleasurable lives you can imagine in 24.
0:23:28.780000 - 0:23:30.180000::So don't change the thing.
0:23:30.180000 - 0:23:31.620000::Do not change a single thing.
0:23:31.620000 - 0:23:35.620000::Just know some crazy ass shit is coming down the pike bitch.
0:23:36.100000 - 0:23:36.700000::Stay.
0:23:37.620000 - 0:23:39.100000::Just keep rolling.
0:23:39.100000 - 0:23:40.420000::Just keep going.
0:23:40.420000 - 0:23:41.100000::Doris.
0:23:41.100000 - 0:23:42.100000::Doris.
0:23:42.100000 - 0:23:43.660000::So Rob's you beat the shit out of you.
0:23:46.340000 - 0:23:49.020000::Oh, yeah, I forgot I was kind of like back then.
0:23:49.020000 - 0:23:50.020000::Yeah.
0:23:52.420000 - 0:23:54.660000::But then I started making twenton.
0:23:54.660000 - 0:23:59.500000::I got a new job because of a guy that I met at improv class because I saw him.
0:23:59.500000 - 0:24:02.500000::Here's why I recognize that he had a good job.
0:24:02.780000 - 0:24:08.460000::He at the bar after improv class, but one of those beers called Lafindu Monde.
0:24:08.580000 - 0:24:10.860000::It's like this has the gold foil top.
0:24:10.860000 - 0:24:12.220000::Oh, yeah.
0:24:12.220000 - 0:24:13.700000::And I was like, you don't have to.
0:24:13.700000 - 0:24:16.780000::How the hell could you afford that?
0:24:16.780000 - 0:24:18.900000::I didn't ask that, but I did kind of go over to him.
0:24:18.900000 - 0:24:19.660000::Like what do you do?
0:24:19.660000 - 0:24:22.060000::Like 45 K like the dude.
0:24:22.060000 - 0:24:27.820000::I mean, he was like, I work at Discovery.
0:24:27.820000 - 0:24:30.500000::I was like, dude, they're hiring and then he's like, yeah, they are.
0:24:30.820000 - 0:24:37.500000::And so I put my name in the ring and I got the job and it was $20 an hour, but it was
0:24:37.500000 - 0:24:38.220000::contract work.
0:24:38.220000 - 0:24:41.500000::So actually, what taxes and like I was paying for healthcare.
0:24:41.500000 - 0:24:47.420000::So really I was probably making them out like 15, 14, but literally I was like walking
0:24:47.420000 - 0:24:48.420000::on.
0:24:48.420000 - 0:24:50.100000::I was like, I don't know how I can spend all this shit.
0:24:50.100000 - 0:24:51.860000::And I remember like we got to dinner.
0:24:51.860000 - 0:24:54.260000::I was buying people drinks.
0:24:54.260000 - 0:24:56.580000::Really didn't understand.
0:24:56.580000 - 0:24:59.700000::And then I looked at my W2 for that job recently and it was like, right.

0:25:00 - 0:25:08.920000::So like 20 I love that you always every tax year look at your entire history to have the full context by the way and make sure that your
0:25:09.420000 - 0:25:16.280000::Eyes and teas are dotted and whatnot for that. I need to know this because that's the last thing I'd want to do is defraud the government of money
0:25:16.280000 - 0:25:22.560000::It's out. Well the IRS is looking at you're like America's most wanted IRS style like they're I know
0:25:22.720000 - 0:25:26.520000::Yeah, they're trying to trick you basically. I'm sending them chocolates
0:25:27.520000 - 0:25:31.640000::Every holiday I send them something edible. Yeah, the IRS
0:25:33.240000 - 0:25:35.240000::Thank you
0:25:35.240000 - 0:25:41.480000::I worked at the only like nine to five adjacent job I had was in Chicago
0:25:41.480000 - 0:25:44.480000::I worked for an HR company for like a month downtown
0:25:45 - 0:25:49.840000::It was so fucking nuts. It was like that nobody had
0:25:50.280000 - 0:25:56.400000::Smartphones it was like their thing so everybody had to you had to hit them on their home phone or on the office
0:25:56.520000 - 0:26:00.640000::Phone and they would have me make the most busted like graphic design

0:26:39.800000 - 0:26:42.360000::Like one of those royalty-free business thingies and
0:26:43.720000 - 0:26:45.720000::eventually

0:26:50.080000 - 0:26:55.760000::They one of the the person who I was like hey, I quit they were like hey just so you know in the future
0:26:56.120000 - 0:27:02.520000::Don't ever let anybody pay you $15 an hour for this type of work ever again because you're using your own equipment
0:27:02.760000 - 0:27:08.600000::You're using your own laptop. You're doing all these things like you're a fucking you quit after a week

0:27:17.160000 - 0:27:21.520000::I guess like younger people that you could take advantage of in that way monetarily
0:27:21.520000 - 0:27:25.280000::Kind of make the creative arts system

0:27:48 - 0:27:53.360000::How could I how could I focus on editing this podcast and giving my all to this every
0:27:53.960000 - 0:27:58.080000::For the couple hours a week that I need I really need to be locked into this shit
0:27:58.800000 - 0:28:00.800000::Where are you finding these interns by the way?
0:28:02.480000 - 0:28:08.120000::I'm finding them by begging you know going to call it going to USC begging people
0:28:08.840000 - 0:28:12::Promising them you know, it's an interesting thing you can do
0:28:12.600000 - 0:28:21.160000::Because you can go on the finding pedophiles research database or whatever and see all the sex offenders in your area red dot red dot red dot red dot
0:28:21.440000 - 0:28:28.520000::These are people who need second chances. These are people who are willing to walk into your startup company and say oh my god
0:28:28.920000 - 0:28:33.400000::You approached me. I thought I was good as dead so I
0:28:33.840000 - 0:28:39.440000::Know we're looking for an intern army at Joy-Tactics. So just a strategy that I'll just come up with
0:28:40.440000 - 0:28:43.440000::I don't appreciate the style of joking or this humor
0:28:43.440000 - 0:28:48.720000::I didn't sign up for this when I said let's do a podcast together commercial with Alicia
0:28:57.680000 - 0:29:05.640000::Web commercial I just got a chubani web commercial break up on girls. I move out move them out. We
0:29:05.640000 - 0:29:07.640000::So
0:29:08.840000 - 0:29:12.880000::Rainy days damn there this one's good and I have an hard time sticking
0:29:12.880000 - 0:29:15.680000::We're hitting all these interesting topics children
0:29:16.160000 - 0:29:24.240000::Court the corporate world. Why can't we stick to a rainy day? You know, I'm saying why is that one hard to stick to when actually that's where I'm the most comfortable
0:29:24.520000 - 0:29:29.920000::Well, this is what I wanted to say about rainy days is that you think that
0:29:30.520000 - 0:29:39.400000::You should rainy days and excuse to stay inside to disrupt your routine to disrupt the progress that you've been making
0:29:40.320000 - 0:29:42.320000::every single day killing it
0:29:43.360000 - 0:29:45.040000::obtaining your goals
0:29:45.040000 - 0:29:47.960000::So I think that a rainy day is when you should go harder
0:29:48.640000 - 0:29:53.400000::Go deeper go outside go for that sprint fucking VO2 max run
0:29:53.400000 - 0:29:59.960000::All right and get all fucking wet get that workout in work all fucking day and night

0:30:00 - 0:30:07.540000::While other people are because everybody during a rainy day is being all lazy and this is when you can get ahead
0:30:08.260000 - 0:30:10.260000::All right, so that means by the way
0:30:10.380000 - 0:30:13.100000::What for the next for the next two weeks after that
0:30:13.440000 - 0:30:17.980000::While everybody's catching up on the work that they could have done on that rainy day
0:30:18.540000 - 0:30:22.940000::You are going to be networking in the hospital with pneumonia from running around
0:30:24.380000 - 0:30:28.100000::People and individuals that have a ton of money and
0:30:29.100000 - 0:30:35.680000::And who is gonna be in the hospital with the pneumonia all the people that we're doing that we're grinding too hard on that rainy day
0:30:35.680000 - 0:30:39.680000::So you're with right now you males how that new board of directors
0:30:39.680000 - 0:30:47.600000::Yep, exactly a E are on New Year's day and see if you don't find the coolest people you've ever heard about
0:30:47.600000 - 0:30:50.960000::See a couple guys you want to mine lithium with remotely
0:30:54.420000 - 0:30:56.260000::Yep, that's what I'm talking about
0:30:56.260000 - 0:30:59.660000::I didn't tell you guys my new business idea, but I want my lithium
0:31:00.580000 - 0:31:03.140000::You should have known is that you've been huh?
0:31:04.180000 - 0:31:06.620000::What you can do is you can get on I don't want to do it
0:31:06.620000 - 0:31:11.220000::I want to pay people less than nothing to do it for me, but you still want to operate it
0:31:11.820000 - 0:31:19.100000::Right, well, and then that less than nothing less than nothing for me, which is actually a very well high amount of wealth for someone else
0:31:19.100000 - 0:31:23.100000::Right, oh you told me about this. Yeah, yeah, you're basically on like a
0:31:24.060000 - 0:31:31.280000::You give them air pods in a foreign country and you just like kind of talking to them like American candy and fucking cigarettes
0:31:32.820000 - 0:31:34.820000::But I steal
0:31:34.820000 - 0:31:36.020000::Gushers
0:31:36.020000 - 0:31:41.340000::Gushers get gishers. Oh wait. I wanted to say this clear for misconception, right?
0:31:41.740000 - 0:31:47.140000::So from the way that I was talking about rainy days you would think I'd like just chilling and not doing anything right?
0:31:47.500000 - 0:31:52.220000::That's what right yeah, well, it was a rainy day today wasn't it
0:31:52.700000 - 0:31:59.260000::Red still is. Yeah, how do you believe I started my day even though I had two martinis with dinner last night and I woke up feeling
0:31:59.260000 - 0:32:03.940000::Fucking and I thought sleep on my phone not at all looking at my phone at 130
0:32:04.340000 - 0:32:11.020000::Well, nobody could survive that so you probably woke up and did some online gambling ate a pint of Ben and Jerry's and
0:32:11.540000 - 0:32:18.860000::That's what a loser would do that's what most losers would do well, then what did you for me? I took my dog for eight minute walk
0:32:19.820000 - 0:32:21.820000::Then I made some coffee
0:32:21.820000 - 0:32:30.020000::Eight then I did some work then I went to the gym and hurt my shoulder doing bench press and then I hit
0:32:31.940000 - 0:32:37.060000::Then I had something called Jacob's ladder and didn't have cardio till I was what is it coughed I
0:32:37.940000 - 0:32:39.940000::coughed
0:32:41.540000 - 0:32:47.980000::So let that sink in before you start throwing accusations around of all you like it being co you like being cozy
0:32:48.860000 - 0:32:53.500000::Yeah, I like that, but I also like fucking work my ass off till it gets all red sore. Oh
0:32:54.380000 - 0:32:56.380000::Ask it's red
0:32:57.500000 - 0:33:01.740000::Yeah, my ass gets all fucking red so after I work. Oh, dude
0:33:01.740000 - 0:33:09.420000::Can I fuck I just thought of this just now okay? What is this has nothing to do with rainy with rain or rain?
0:33:09.420000 - 0:33:16.620000::It's okay, but it has to do with water a little bit so that we can tangentially yeah speaking of got a case of this
0:33:18.940000 - 0:33:23.860000::Speaking of anyways liquid that looks looks kind of looks how are you gonna be late nice?
0:33:26.140000 - 0:33:30.540000::So if you want to feel like a you've
0:33:31.980000 - 0:33:33.980000::Accomplished something
0:33:34.180000 - 0:33:36.180000::Do a DIY
0:33:37.900000 - 0:33:39.340000::Fix
0:33:39.340000 - 0:33:42.540000::plumbing fix okay, so my toilet the I?
0:33:43.500000 - 0:33:49.900000::The I don't even know how to describe this there was something fucked up with the handle it wasn't working
0:33:49.900000 - 0:33:56.380000::Okay, and it was connected to the flapper, you know you you guys don't know any of this shit because you guys have never fucking done
0:33:56.580000 - 0:34:02.540000::Any sort of handyman working your entire fucking lives you have no fucking idea how to fix a cover
0:34:02.540000 - 0:34:05.340000::The chain wasn't ideal the chain wasn't tight enough
0:34:05.900000 - 0:34:08.620000::Am I right? Well you're wrong actually
0:34:09.260000 - 0:34:16.460000::Well, it's a prize you to know my great-grandfather who came here with no money and his parents died when he was 15 was a plumber in the Bronx
0:34:22.220000 - 0:34:24.620000::Oh my god Eric no way
0:34:28.860000 - 0:34:32.940000::Yeah, I'll tell you what he was five foot two eyes totally under it
0:34:33.420000 - 0:34:39.580000::That's funny now that that's funny that that five foot two was like being five but two fucking games on crack
0:34:40.220000 - 0:34:46.460000::Yeah, so you're linear so all made in height kind of that's right my brother six five. Okay, so Nate you fixed your toilet
0:34:46.780000 - 0:34:54.660000::So I fucking was like sure what I'm not gonna and by the way my landlord isn't paying for plumbing fixes isn't that fucked up?
0:34:56.300000 - 0:34:59.500000::You guys you're trying to try to scratch the lawyer don't worry about it

0:35:00 - 0:35:02.240000::This is so messed up.
0:35:02.240000 - 0:35:05.840000::I had to pay for my fucking fridge to get fucking fixed.
0:35:05.840000 - 0:35:06.720000::Are you fucking kidding me?
0:35:06.720000 - 0:35:08.760000::I'm renting this apartment.
0:35:08.760000 - 0:35:09.600000::Oh, all right.
0:35:09.600000 - 0:35:11.520000::I don't know this fucking refrigerator.
0:35:11.520000 - 0:35:12.800000::Am I being taken advantage of?
0:35:12.800000 - 0:35:13.640000::You're being taken advantage of?
0:35:13.640000 - 0:35:15.520000::I'll put him on blast, Howard management.
0:35:17.520000 - 0:35:18.400000::Oh, yeah.
0:35:18.400000 - 0:35:20.800000::Whoopsies, you messed with the wrong guy.
0:35:20.800000 - 0:35:21.640000::That's funny.
0:35:21.640000 - 0:35:24.640000::You didn't know I had a five-cast that got out to doubt.
0:35:24.640000 - 0:35:26.040000::Thousands of people.
0:35:26.040000 - 0:35:28.200000::May it's clearly like podcasting from the back.
0:35:28.200000 - 0:35:31.200000::It was prehist for the next three months.
0:35:31.200000 - 0:35:35.560000::Nate, well, are you going to take the refrigerator with you
0:35:35.560000 - 0:35:38.320000::or mess it up again on the way out?
0:35:38.320000 - 0:35:41.280000::I should own like a chunk of it at this point
0:35:41.280000 - 0:35:43.760000::because I put fucking three hundred dollars
0:35:43.760000 - 0:35:46.760000::in that fucking sh**.
0:35:46.760000 - 0:35:49.440000::And it was, and the thing is, I think it was a minor fix.
0:35:49.440000 - 0:35:51.280000::Like it was something I could have looked up.
0:35:51.280000 - 0:35:54.040000::Anyways, I was like, I'm not going to fucking pay
0:35:54.040000 - 0:35:56.040000::for a plumber to come out because I'm
0:35:56.040000 - 0:35:58::going to try and figure this shit out.
0:35:58 - 0:36:00.640000::And I was like, I went to Home Depot
0:36:00.640000 - 0:36:04.360000::and I just used Common Sense and a YouTube tutorial.
0:36:04.360000 - 0:36:05.120000::And guess what?
0:36:05.120000 - 0:36:06.960000::I fucking did the damn thing.
0:36:06.960000 - 0:36:07.640000::Dane.
0:36:07.640000 - 0:36:12.320000::And I went into my bedroom and my girlfriend
0:36:12.320000 - 0:36:16.960000::was doubting me, which I don't know why she was.
0:36:16.960000 - 0:36:21.720000::Even though I've come through on many different various projects
0:36:21.720000 - 0:36:23.440000::and things in the past.
0:36:23.440000 - 0:36:24.280000::She was doubting me.
0:36:24.280000 - 0:36:27.600000::And I went in and I said, yeah, it's fucking go check.
0:36:27.600000 - 0:36:29.280000::I mean, that was one of the best feelings.
0:36:29.280000 - 0:36:30.280000::Try that out.
0:36:30.280000 - 0:36:38.840000::OK, sorry.
0:36:38.840000 - 0:36:43.280000::So no, but it just felt amazing to like just fix something.
0:36:43.280000 - 0:36:45.360000::There is nothing like getting a little,
0:36:45.360000 - 0:36:50.360000::I'm one of the least handy people that exists by choice
0:36:50.360000 - 0:36:52.920000::because I'm very naturally inclined to be able to fix things
0:36:52.920000 - 0:36:54.480000::and knowing how they work.
0:36:54.480000 - 0:36:57.480000::But I just would rather be riding and drawing.
0:36:57.480000 - 0:37:04.160000::But fix it, just doing the small, it makes you feel so fucking
0:37:04.160000 - 0:37:05.800000::good with it.
0:37:05.800000 - 0:37:07.600000::Well, don't go gardening.
0:37:07.600000 - 0:37:08.800000::Yeah, do know what you mean.
0:37:08.800000 - 0:37:09.800000::Good, right.
0:37:09.800000 - 0:37:12.880000::And it's going to be, you're going to be needing to,
0:37:12.880000 - 0:37:14.840000::we need to return to this.
0:37:14.840000 - 0:37:18.520000::I would say, because look at the way AI is going,
0:37:18.520000 - 0:37:22.040000::all of these fools paying $100,000 a semester
0:37:22.040000 - 0:37:26.160000::to go to college at, I can't think of fucking college.
0:37:26.160000 - 0:37:28.200000::You're fools because, all right, great.
0:37:28.200000 - 0:37:33.960000::Because there's going to be no jobs besides manual laborious
0:37:33.960000 - 0:37:38.720000::on the spot, on call in jobs, plumbing, coming in and fixed
0:37:38.720000 - 0:37:39.480000::the plumbing.
0:37:39.480000 - 0:37:43.240000::These are things that can't be automated, that can't be AI.
0:37:43.240000 - 0:37:44.200000::So what are we waiting for?
0:37:44.200000 - 0:37:49.560000::And by the way, joy tactics, this, yeah, we're probably next
0:37:49.560000 - 0:37:50.800000::when it comes to the AI.
0:37:50.800000 - 0:37:51.800000::I've already seen it.
0:37:51.800000 - 0:37:53.320000::You can't automate this style.
0:37:53.320000 - 0:37:54.080000::Yeah, yeah.
0:37:54.080000 - 0:37:57.560000::Good luck trying to automate this type of seamless transition
0:37:57.560000 - 0:38:02.280000::from topic to tangential thoughts to riding the line
0:38:02.280000 - 0:38:06.360000::between choking and being kind of these kind of self-help
0:38:06.360000 - 0:38:08.800000::guys and like saying too much about our personal lives.
0:38:08.800000 - 0:38:10.560000::No one else can do that shit.
0:38:10.560000 - 0:38:12.360000::And beepboxing will help now.
0:38:12.360000 - 0:38:16.480000::I would love to see a little bit of a thing.
0:38:16.480000 - 0:38:17.840000::I can't be box yet.
0:38:17.840000 - 0:38:18.720000::Can they?
0:38:18.720000 - 0:38:20.880000::They can't make noises yet.
0:38:20.880000 - 0:38:21.440000::Can they?
0:38:21.440000 - 0:38:22.960000::They can only make words.
0:38:22.960000 - 0:38:23.600000::But they can't.
0:38:23.600000 - 0:38:24.600000::Yeah.
0:38:28.600000 - 0:38:29.560000::Right.
0:38:29.560000 - 0:38:30.360000::Do it.
0:38:30.360000 - 0:38:31.320000::Appreciate you.
0:38:31.320000 - 0:38:32.920000::I appreciate it.
0:38:32.920000 - 0:38:33.400000::Sure.
0:38:33.400000 - 0:38:35.280000::It's fun today.
0:38:35.280000 - 0:38:36.640000::Well, well, well.
0:38:36.640000 - 0:38:39.480000::So my next question for you guys is this.
0:38:39.480000 - 0:38:42.640000::Eric, keep your eyes right there.
0:38:42.640000 - 0:38:46.800000::You are entering a new mindset.
0:38:46.800000 - 0:38:51.400000::OK, what do you do?
0:38:51.400000 - 0:38:54.240000::Because you call it a rainy day, but zoom out.
0:38:54.240000 - 0:38:57.280000::Sometimes a rainy day from the back hits a rainy day
0:38:57.280000 - 0:39:00.160000::from the front and turns into a rainy week.
0:39:00.160000 - 0:39:02.280000::And then all of a sudden it's a rainy month.
0:39:02.280000 - 0:39:04.320000::And then it's a rainy year.
0:39:04.320000 - 0:39:07.680000::And then it's a rainy life if you live in the rainforest
0:39:07.680000 - 0:39:09.320000::as well, for sure.
0:39:09.320000 - 0:39:12.120000::So what do you do then?
0:39:12.120000 - 0:39:15.640000::How do you analyze a moment?
0:39:15.640000 - 0:39:19.280000::Is it a rainy minute to go in the other direction?
0:39:19.280000 - 0:39:22.720000::How do you deal with all this rain?
0:39:22.720000 - 0:39:27::Let the rain and mother nature is what you're talking about
0:39:27 - 0:39:28.080000::right now.
0:39:28.080000 - 0:39:29.720000::Well, just so interesting.
0:39:29.720000 - 0:39:31.640000::Thanks.
0:39:31.640000 - 0:39:33.520000::Yeah, what else we talk about?
0:39:33.520000 - 0:39:34.640000::Eric, are you going to say something?
0:39:34.640000 - 0:39:37.560000::Are you just kind of like just...
0:39:37.560000 - 0:39:40.200000::I was just thinking about it like this.
0:39:40.200000 - 0:39:42.400000::So, Jack, you're saying, what if...
0:39:45.280000 - 0:39:47.440000::You're going to frog in my throat today.
0:39:47.440000 - 0:39:52.440000::What if rainy day is the rule and not the exception?
0:39:52.440000 - 0:39:53.520000::That's what you're saying.
0:39:53.520000 - 0:39:55.360000::What if it doesn't say?
0:39:55.360000 - 0:39:57.600000::What if the pain...
0:39:57.600000 - 0:39:58.960000::Yeah, just...
0:39:58.960000 - 0:39:59.800000::Sort of.

0:40:00 - 0:40:05::what I'm saying is framing and context and scope.
0:40:06.780000 - 0:40:11.780000::So looking at a rainy day versus a rainy second, right?
0:40:11.780000 - 0:40:13.560000::So maybe the rain is only for one second,
0:40:13.560000 - 0:40:16::but what we're really talking about is context
0:40:16 - 0:40:18.560000::and circumstances which are trying.
0:40:18.560000 - 0:40:21.900000::In this case, it's in the form of wet molecules
0:40:21.900000 - 0:40:25.400000::and often cold molecules will exacerbate the feeling
0:40:25.400000 - 0:40:27.800000::of how trying it is when there's a rainy day.
0:40:28.560000 - 0:40:32.920000::But it's not actually about the rainy day
0:40:32.920000 - 0:40:34.960000::because if you lived in an area
0:40:34.960000 - 0:40:37.040000::that was on fire every single day
0:40:37.040000 - 0:40:39.120000::because the apocalypse and you got to get out there
0:40:39.120000 - 0:40:41.480000::and have a gun and this and that,
0:40:41.480000 - 0:40:43.280000::you're looking at the rain going thank God
0:40:43.280000 - 0:40:44.840000::or whatever if you live in a dry area,
0:40:44.840000 - 0:40:45.680000::you're thinking thank God.
0:40:45.680000 - 0:40:47.760000::So what we're not actually really talking about
0:40:47.760000 - 0:40:49.560000::is rainy days when we say that, aren't we?
0:40:50.520000 - 0:40:51.360000::We're talking about.
0:40:51.360000 - 0:40:53.120000::Now I get it.
0:40:53.120000 - 0:40:53.960000::Hardness.
0:40:53.960000 - 0:40:55.120000::No, we're not talking about rainy days.
0:40:55.120000 - 0:40:56.280000::Hardness.
0:40:57.960000 - 0:41:00::Or maybe we're not talking about that.
0:41:01.480000 - 0:41:03.480000::You know, I will say that, you know,
0:41:03.480000 - 0:41:06.720000::I wanted this to be about the cozy things that we do
0:41:06.720000 - 0:41:08.920000::when it's dark and stormy outside
0:41:08.920000 - 0:41:10.920000::and you're forced to ruin it.
0:41:10.920000 - 0:41:12.120000::We're going to call it under the covers.
0:41:12.120000 - 0:41:15.600000::So we're going to have another episode called the cozy episode
0:41:15.600000 - 0:41:17.720000::and we'll be doing it from our blanket forts
0:41:17.720000 - 0:41:20::and that's where we'll be reading.
0:41:20 - 0:41:21.400000::Yep.
0:41:21.400000 - 0:41:23.960000::So Harry Potter fanfiction I've been writing
0:41:23.960000 - 0:41:28.120000::and Jack, you can make the sounds of a fireplace
0:41:28.120000 - 0:41:29.280000::while I read it.
0:41:29.280000 - 0:41:31.920000::But this one I guess is more about
0:41:31.920000 - 0:41:34.960000::what do you do in the face of constant discomfort?
0:41:34.960000 - 0:41:35.800000::What?
0:41:37.520000 - 0:41:39.480000::When the easiest out is just leaving this part.
0:41:39.480000 - 0:41:40.680000::What was that?
0:41:40.680000 - 0:41:41.840000::What was that?
0:41:41.840000 - 0:41:42.880000::Huh?
0:41:42.880000 - 0:41:45.960000::You've been kind of glitching a lot this episode.
0:41:45.960000 - 0:41:47.720000::Well, I have things going on that I've told you guys
0:41:47.720000 - 0:41:50.120000::about medically and I'd appreciate it if you don't
0:41:50.120000 - 0:41:51.400000::fucking bring it up on this.
0:41:51.400000 - 0:41:52.080000::The public episode.
0:41:52.080000 - 0:41:53.240000::All right.
0:41:54.240000 - 0:41:57.040000::No problem, man.
0:41:57.040000 - 0:41:58.040000::No problem.
0:41:58.040000 - 0:42:02.560000::Uh, oh, can I address what's behind me right now
0:42:02.560000 - 0:42:05.880000::and if you're watching right now, please, please,
0:42:05.880000 - 0:42:09.960000::you're staring at about six cases,
0:42:09.960000 - 0:42:15.160000::24 racks of Madelo, a Kirkland Margreta mix,
0:42:15.160000 - 0:42:18.320000::as well as 1.75 liters, two of them
0:42:18.320000 - 0:42:21.120000::of Kirkland brand tequila.
0:42:21.160000 - 0:42:24.760000::Now, why would I need so much alcohol
0:42:24.760000 - 0:42:27.960000::and my immune is really good?
0:42:27.960000 - 0:42:30.240000::Is it because I'm arranging alcoholic
0:42:30.240000 - 0:42:34.240000::and this is what I go through on about a week's,
0:42:34.240000 - 0:42:36.320000::a week's time?
0:42:36.320000 - 0:42:37.320000::No.
0:42:37.320000 - 0:42:42.360000::I barely drink because I need to be focused on my projects.
0:42:42.360000 - 0:42:45.200000::Because you can't handle alcohol like I can.
0:42:45.200000 - 0:42:46.440000::Exactly.
0:42:46.440000 - 0:42:47.720000::Exactly.
0:42:47.720000 - 0:42:48.520000::No one can.
0:42:49.320000 - 0:42:56.320000::But this is for, well, this is going to be dropping
0:42:56.320000 - 0:42:57.080000::Monday.
0:42:57.080000 - 0:42:57.880000::And guess what?
0:42:57.880000 - 0:43:00.200000::While you're listening to this, we
0:43:00.200000 - 0:43:05.520000::are going to be in a room with around 200 to 250
0:43:05.520000 - 0:43:09.880000::like-minded individuals who are going to be laughing and drinking
0:43:09.880000 - 0:43:12.280000::and getting fucked up out of their minds
0:43:12.280000 - 0:43:16.240000::while watching three of the most-goated rising podcasters
0:43:16.240000 - 0:43:19.360000::and comedians on planet actors as well producers.
0:43:19.360000 - 0:43:21.880000::And actors as well, sorry, I don't feel like you're saying
0:43:21.880000 - 0:43:27.800000::producers and entrepreneurs doing stand-up comedy.
0:43:27.800000 - 0:43:29.120000::It's going to be beautiful.
0:43:29.120000 - 0:43:33.160000::And it's a DIY event.
0:43:33.160000 - 0:43:39.800000::So let me ask you, oh, that's margarita mix.
0:43:39.800000 - 0:43:41.480000::That's for distributing the margaritas
0:43:41.480000 - 0:43:43.680000::or those plastic buckets.
0:43:43.680000 - 0:43:45.680000::Hello.
0:43:45.680000 - 0:43:46.520000::Hello.
0:43:46.520000 - 0:43:49.280000::Mescal style, if I'm not mistaken.
0:43:49.280000 - 0:43:51.600000::Well, it's actually tequila, but I know I said I was going
0:43:51.600000 - 0:43:52.600000::to be a disco.
0:43:52.600000 - 0:43:52.920000::All right.
0:43:52.920000 - 0:43:55.480000::How much are we charging for margaritas?
0:43:55.480000 - 0:43:56.880000::How much should we charge?
0:43:56.880000 - 0:43:58.760000::I'm wondering.
0:43:58.760000 - 0:44:01.440000::Should we have a secret code for just kind of drinks
0:44:01.440000 - 0:44:03.720000::for joy tacticians?
0:44:03.720000 - 0:44:04.840000::No, because then it holds on to.
0:44:04.840000 - 0:44:05.840000::Hold on.
0:44:05.840000 - 0:44:06.040000::Right.
0:44:06.040000 - 0:44:06.840000::Yeah.
0:44:06.840000 - 0:44:07.360000::OK.
0:44:07.360000 - 0:44:09.240000::Let's try it, guys.
0:44:09.240000 - 0:44:11.240000::I think margaritas should be, you know,
0:44:11.240000 - 0:44:13.520000::I think we should go cheap with it.
0:44:13.520000 - 0:44:14.400000::I think margaritas should be.
0:44:14.400000 - 0:44:15.480000::Should we make nothing on this?
0:44:15.480000 - 0:44:17.160000::We should make nothing and get everybody
0:44:17.160000 - 0:44:20.760000::enough paid it as possible with everybody drive home.
0:44:20.760000 - 0:44:21.800000::$1 beers.
0:44:21.800000 - 0:44:25.320000::And we should have a transparency markup on the menu.
0:44:25.320000 - 0:44:27.400000::It's like, here's how much that, because this
0:44:27.400000 - 0:44:29.080000::is like a dollar a beer right here.
0:44:29.080000 - 0:44:29.920000::Yep.
0:44:29.920000 - 0:44:30.400000::OK.
0:44:30.400000 - 0:44:33.680000::A dollar 10 cents or something a beer.
0:44:33.680000 - 0:44:35.880000::So we could put the markup, hey, listen,
0:44:35.880000 - 0:44:37.680000::we're going to be selling this for 16 bucks.
0:44:37.680000 - 0:44:43.320000::So just you know, we're making $15 off of this.
0:44:43.320000 - 0:44:45.880000::And I know that's a lot for a 12 ounce can of Madelo,
0:44:45.880000 - 0:44:48.840000::but Eric, you're all are pressing it before he's
0:44:48.840000 - 0:44:53.240000::praying for the spitting on all the fucking mouthfully dry.
0:44:53.240000 - 0:44:55.200000::That's a bit left.
0:44:55.200000 - 0:44:56.040000::And what do you get?
0:44:56.040000 - 0:44:57.040000::Should we do?
0:44:57.040000 - 0:44:58.680000::Should we do a snake?
0:44:58.680000 - 0:45:00.080000::Yeah, for the more.

0:45:00 - 0:45:02::on the first draws.
0:45:03 - 0:45:06.600000::Plastic. I got Styrofoam cups and straws. Oh, bruh.
0:45:07.400000 - 0:45:13.740000::And I'll say this if you're coming in the show and you want to bring liquor to contribute or you want to have us try some liquor
0:45:14.040000 - 0:45:16.520000::Please do it bring as much liquor as you want
0:45:18.360000 - 0:45:21.500000::So Eric has just now made this a BYUV event

0:45:38.120000 - 0:45:42.160000::That's what we have downstairs in security guards. Well, this is a private event
0:45:42.160000 - 0:45:48.320000::This isn't a theater. This isn't like a a place that needs to like this is our private event
0:45:48.320000 - 0:45:55.200000::Okay, and if you're gonna I get out of line if you're gonna fucking get blacked out drunk, which we want you to
0:45:55.720000 - 0:46:00.400000::But in a non-disruptive way we want you to be like kind of quiet and blacked out drunk
0:46:03.200000 - 0:46:04.960000::Yeah, we got all the town
0:46:04.960000 - 0:46:08.360000::But if you're gonna be loud and rude and disrespectful

0:46:26.200000 - 0:46:32.040000::Well, you know well, it's because that's the day the eclipse right the day that's because of the it happens
0:46:32.040000 - 0:46:33.640000::No, no
0:46:33.640000 - 0:46:38.360000::Starts at the exact second that the Sun will be blocked out from that
0:46:38.880000 - 0:46:46.240000::Should we do a solar eclipse a podcast solar eclipse podcast that it's that happens at 11 a.m. To 12 30

0:47:03.520000 - 0:47:07::Right around noon. It's gonna be pitch black for about three milliseconds
0:47:08.680000 - 0:47:14.480000::Let's rob somebody no which won't maybe that's the other oh you could take an app to during that
0:47:14.480000 - 0:47:18.360000::I cannot believe that these celestial bodies are moving around us in this way
0:47:18.360000 - 0:47:25.040000::Can you believe that Eric that's what happening huh?
0:47:25.960000 - 0:47:29.280000::You think that the earth is the center of the gravitational universe
0:47:31.200000 - 0:47:35.280000::The heat of the center of the bottle all right. We're moving around them. They're moving around
0:47:35.800000 - 0:47:38.880000::Obviously, the Sun's fixed in the middle. That's the denseest
0:47:39.920000 - 0:47:42.400000::Physical object in our solar system to say the least
0:47:42.840000 - 0:47:49.320000::Okay, just checking so yeah, I know this I've written essays on it. I know how this functions
0:47:49.840000 - 0:47:57.320000::All right, but round us and I'll go see other solar systems whipping around the moon whipping around us. I
0:47:57.640000 - 0:47:59.640000::Can't believe it
0:47:59.640000 - 0:48:02.960000::Sometimes thinking about who just how could it is but a god?
0:48:03.560000 - 0:48:06.560000::Who could have what could have designed this but a god
0:48:07.360000 - 0:48:13.520000::Maybe a game a video game designer could probably come as close as anybody I know but beyond that I don't know
0:48:14.240000 - 0:48:17.520000::Do you guys want to hear my astrophysical
0:48:18.400000 - 0:48:20.600000::Theory which I don't think has ever been
0:48:21.760000 - 0:48:23.760000::stated before we earned it I
0:48:24.840000 - 0:48:32.120000::Think a physicist would be astounded and I hope I inspire somebody who really knows what they're talking about and doing and some of it Oxford
0:48:32.120000 - 0:48:39.160000::University at one of these top tier MIT sort of programs to really dig into this because I think I got it
0:48:39.160000 - 0:48:41.160000::I think I figured it out. Let's hear it
0:48:41.760000 - 0:48:47.360000::So this is I'm not even kidding you. I thought this is what I think is going down
0:48:47.600000 - 0:48:52.400000::Okay, this is this is in terms of parallel realities. Okay, and dimensions
0:48:53.240000 - 0:48:57.920000::So the universe is constantly expanding correct right? I presumably
0:48:58.880000 - 0:49:04.960000::Yeah, so the universe is constantly expanding all right now
0:49:04.960000 - 0:49:10::I think that the universe it's infinitely expanding so it's always been
0:49:11.040000 - 0:49:15.760000::Drifting further and further apart so in an infinite time frame
0:49:16.800000 - 0:49:18::universe
0:49:18 - 0:49:22.160000::Let me just I've never said this out loud. This is just been in
0:49:23.280000 - 0:49:25.280000::My journals
0:49:28.480000 - 0:49:33.360000::Now you know how I feel why is this so funny to talk about writing essays for like nobody like
0:49:35.200000 - 0:49:42.080000::It's the best but anyways, okay, so if you imagine our current universe expanding okay over
0:49:43.520000 - 0:49:49.880000::Trillions times to the exponential you know I'm saying eventually it's gonna drift so far apart that there's absolutely
0:49:49.880000 - 0:49:54::It's you know, I'm saying you get I'm saying it just is okay. There's gonna be very far apart
0:49:54 - 0:50:00.080000::Everything so far apart right that it's gonna create a vacuum and then it's gonna start

0:50:00 - 0:50:02.460000::start over. That's where the big what do you mean?
0:50:02.460000 - 0:50:03.700000::Why would it create a vacuum?
0:50:03.700000 - 0:50:05.060000::I don't know. Again, I'm not.
0:50:05.060000 - 0:50:07.500000::Why would it create a vacuum if it's so far apart?
0:50:07.500000 - 0:50:10.300000::Because if you and me get farther and farther away from each other,
0:50:10.300000 - 0:50:15.140000::you're saying there becomes a point when there's nothing we don't exist anymore?
0:50:15.140000 - 0:50:20.240000::I think there's too much nothing that it kind of that's when the big bang happens.
0:50:20.240000 - 0:50:22.380000::When there's like too much of nothing.
0:50:22.380000 - 0:50:25.100000::You know what I'm saying? Like it spreads out so far apart.
0:50:25.100000 - 0:50:29.460000::That's like there's so much nothing right here that let's just make one of
0:50:29.460000 - 0:50:31.300000::these explosions and then it happens again.
0:50:31.300000 - 0:50:33.140000::Let's just make one.
0:50:33.140000 - 0:50:35.140000::I have a question about darkening.
0:50:35.140000 - 0:50:40.260000::Again, I don't have I don't have the mathematical equations to prove this.
0:50:40.260000 - 0:50:42.140000::I don't have that type of information.
0:50:42.140000 - 0:50:45.020000::All right, I'm just a person who has the creative ideas.
0:50:45.020000 - 0:50:47.580000::All right, I'm saying this is the design of it.
0:50:47.580000 - 0:50:51.300000::All right. You should somebody you should hire like a 19 year old like
0:50:51.300000 - 0:50:54.820000::math SAT tutor and be like, I don't need to fucking take the SATs.
0:50:54.820000 - 0:50:59.140000::I already did that shit. Help me figure this shit out right now.
0:50:59.220000 - 0:51:03.220000::Let me figure out when the after my the amount of time the universal will
0:51:03.220000 - 0:51:06.060000::become a vacuum and everything starts again.
0:51:06.060000 - 0:51:13.020000::But I'm saying that it happens like the that's where the parallel
0:51:13.020000 - 0:51:14.820000::reality has come from. Okay.
0:51:14.820000 - 0:51:19.900000::Well, when you say parallel, you're saying that what does that mean?
0:51:19.900000 - 0:51:24.100000::That there's two universe that makes it into two universes at the same time?
0:51:24.100000 - 0:51:26.700000::Exactly. So if time isn't linear.
0:51:26.700000 - 0:51:28.780000::All right. So you know what I'm saying?
0:51:28.780000 - 0:51:31.620000::Are you saying that and there's another reality?
0:51:31.620000 - 0:51:36.140000::So there's another earth being created and everything is happening in the same
0:51:36.140000 - 0:51:38.780000::exact way, but little tiny changes are happening.
0:51:39.060000 - 0:51:43.220000::Can I just tell you guys that these are the type of conversations that kings
0:51:43.220000 - 0:51:45.900000::would have had scholars killed for back in the day?
0:51:46.100000 - 0:51:50.500000::We would use that's why guilds are made and people were dark clothes.
0:51:51.060000 - 0:51:53.860000::It's because they would if you were talking about something like this,
0:51:53.860000 - 0:51:58.380000::this blasphemous death to all don't be so cocky right now.
0:51:58.380000 - 0:52:01.380000::Eric that you don't still live in that time.
0:52:01.660000 - 0:52:02.660000::Look at Boeing.
0:52:03.020000 - 0:52:05.060000::Look at the Hillary Clinton body count.
0:52:05.060000 - 0:52:06.020000::Don't get me started.
0:52:06.020000 - 0:52:08.380000::Okay. I don't believe either of those.
0:52:08.740000 - 0:52:14.500000::I can tell you're holding back of some of the ideas you have because you're afraid.
0:52:15.340000 - 0:52:16.940000::I'm too close to the Boeing issue.
0:52:17.340000 - 0:52:18.340000::I'll just say that.
0:52:21.340000 - 0:52:24.180000::And the house of cards is beginning to fall.
0:52:25.220000 - 0:52:27.780000::I was forged by the houses of cards as well.
0:52:28.380000 - 0:52:33.100000::I think I'm playing this fucking new game that dance alone.
0:52:33.100000 - 0:52:34.500000::Tell me about and Danny.
0:52:34.500000 - 0:52:35.260000::Oh, what's it called?
0:52:35.260000 - 0:52:37.100000::Kalo Bellatro.
0:52:37.860000 - 0:52:38.860000::Oh, yeah, look that up.
0:52:38.860000 - 0:52:40.500000::It looks like fucking it looks.
0:52:40.500000 - 0:52:41.580000::I was like, what?
0:52:41.620000 - 0:52:43.900000::This is the game you guys are fucking addicted to.
0:52:43.900000 - 0:52:46.940000::It's so no, no, no, no.
0:52:47.220000 - 0:52:48.300000::It's not solitary.
0:52:48.300000 - 0:52:50.420000::Dude, Jack, you would love this fucking game.
0:52:50.980000 - 0:52:52.340000::It's like a road like game.
0:52:52.420000 - 0:52:53.740000::You can power up the car.
0:52:54.020000 - 0:52:58.180000::You're powering up just like 52 card deck and trying to create real money
0:52:58.180000 - 0:53:00.580000::off of it and meet real women on it.
0:53:01.420000 - 0:53:06.660000::No, you're talking about a relation poker women's poker group that you infiltrated.
0:53:07.140000 - 0:53:07.740000::That's I know.
0:53:07.740000 - 0:53:07.780000::I know.
0:53:07.780000 - 0:53:09.420000::And gender can be in this poker group.
0:53:11.500000 - 0:53:14.020000::And I'm the only person who's allowed to not be from Malaysia.
0:53:14.020000 - 0:53:16.340000::But that's my way of making friends.
0:53:17.940000 - 0:53:19.540000::You guys are all smoking's chiefing.
0:53:19.540000 - 0:53:24.100000::See, he's wearing those green, you know, those like green see through poker.
0:53:24.100000 - 0:53:26.500000::Oh, yeah, they should give those out.
0:53:27.380000 - 0:53:28.540000::At casinos.
0:53:29.140000 - 0:53:34.180000::I just spent $55 on this new quote unquote vintage Tommy Bahama.
0:53:35.540000 - 0:53:39.060000::But now I'm from when you go to Atlantic City has like poker cards on the back.
0:53:39.220000 - 0:53:42.980000::And I thought it looks so sick in the picture, but up close it looks so tacky.
0:53:42.980000 - 0:53:44.380000::I'm fucking crap.
0:53:44.380000 - 0:53:45.420000::I hate that.
0:53:45.620000 - 0:53:47.300000::I'm gonna wear it anyways.
0:53:47.300000 - 0:53:48.180000::It maybe it's cool.
0:53:52.100000 - 0:53:53.100000::And you don't want to return it.
0:53:53.100000 - 0:53:55.820000::I eat you because it's just it's I have.
0:53:55.820000 - 0:53:57.500000::I don't have the energy to return something.
0:53:57.500000 - 0:53:58.460000::Sometimes I didn't.
0:53:58.460000 - 0:54:02.780000::I'm my mic is sitting right now on a pair of converse that were too big.
0:54:03.740000 - 0:54:05.740000::But I just haven't returned a box of converse.
0:54:05.740000 - 0:54:07.580000::You can donate out to give him to you.
0:54:07.580000 - 0:54:08.620000::But you have freakish feet.
0:54:11.060000 - 0:54:16.060000::Freakish interesting adjective to describe how my body is naturally.
0:54:17.900000 - 0:54:19.060000::Michael Jordan's a freak.
0:54:19.860000 - 0:54:21.460000::I know he in the sheath.
0:54:21.460000 - 0:54:23.940000::I mean, that's a high, a high compliment.
0:54:26.380000 - 0:54:26.900000::MJ.
0:54:26.900000 - 0:54:28.940000::So we
0:54:29.220000 - 0:54:32.100000::body the topic rainy days.
0:54:32.740000 - 0:54:35.140000::Not we didn't go cozy with it.
0:54:35.140000 - 0:54:38.700000::We kind of I would give us a D minus.
0:54:38.700000 - 0:54:40.500000::I would say for sticking to the topic.
0:54:40.980000 - 0:54:45.700000::We had a few rallies where we tried to bring it back, but we couldn't figure out how to do it.
0:54:45.700000 - 0:54:48.260000::But our highest grade ever is probably going to see plus.
0:54:48.300000 - 0:54:49.300000::So it's it.
0:54:49.540000 - 0:54:55.500000::If you if you if you grade it on that scale, we probably get a B minus or so.
0:54:55.500000 - 0:55:00.020000::And sometimes the worst sometimes the worst grade you ever get is the most you ever learned.

0:55:00 - 0:55:01.880000::could have learned.
0:55:01.880000 - 0:55:02.380000::Wow.
0:55:02.380000 - 0:55:04.680000::That is so interestingly true.
0:55:04.680000 - 0:55:07.280000::Well, and I don't really like scoring.
0:55:07.280000 - 0:55:08.880000::And I don't like grades.
0:55:08.880000 - 0:55:10.680000::Oh, we're afraid of capitalism and competition.
0:55:10.680000 - 0:55:12.520000::That's why you're such a fucking loser, man.
0:55:12.520000 - 0:55:13.360000::No, I'm not.
0:55:13.360000 - 0:55:14.480000::I actually welcome it.
0:55:14.480000 - 0:55:15.320000::And I like it.
0:55:15.320000 - 0:55:17.240000::And I drive me to be better.
0:55:17.240000 - 0:55:18.640000::I literally didn't even mean that.
0:55:18.640000 - 0:55:20.880000::I just said that to drive you even further.
0:55:20.880000 - 0:55:23.360000::Every time I'm like crazy me into you and texting you
0:55:23.360000 - 0:55:25.880000::in the middle of the night, like, laughing at the wild.
0:55:25.880000 - 0:55:28.480000::Videos of me and my family laughing at you
0:55:28.480000 - 0:55:29.320000::in pictures of you.
0:55:29.320000 - 0:55:33.160000::It's just, it's the market.
0:55:33.160000 - 0:55:34.640000::You got this.
0:55:34.640000 - 0:55:35.920000::That's why you do that.
0:55:35.920000 - 0:55:37.640000::OK.
0:55:37.640000 - 0:55:38.800000::So.
0:55:38.800000 - 0:55:39.480000::So.
0:55:39.480000 - 0:55:40.560000::Shall we sing a little song?
0:55:40.560000 - 0:55:42.600000::The thing about this podcast is, if you haven't
0:55:42.600000 - 0:55:46.920000::listened to us before, we are fixated upon joy.
0:55:46.920000 - 0:55:50.400000::And what we like to find out is that we're obsessed with it.
0:55:50.400000 - 0:55:52.200000::I said we're obsessed with it.
0:55:52.200000 - 0:55:54.400000::We're obsessed with joy.
0:55:54.400000 - 0:55:58.480000::What we like to investigate every episode is what our fellow,
0:55:58.480000 - 0:56:02.560000::the other ones, became joyful from.
0:56:05.560000 - 0:56:09.680000::The way you said that is, this is a little worrying
0:56:09.680000 - 0:56:11.240000::for how my brain is doing.
0:56:11.240000 - 0:56:12.360000::But I get what you're saying.
0:56:12.360000 - 0:56:15.080000::I get what you're saying.
0:56:15.080000 - 0:56:17.120000::Every episode, if there's, imagine that.
0:56:17.120000 - 0:56:20.240000::Somebody listening to this for the first time, that's beautiful.
0:56:20.240000 - 0:56:22.640000::Because a lot of people have listened to every single episode.
0:56:22.640000 - 0:56:25.760000::And they wish that they could watch Star Wars for the first time
0:56:25.760000 - 0:56:27::again with those fresh eyes.
0:56:27 - 0:56:28.880000::So if you're listening to this for the first time,
0:56:28.880000 - 0:56:33.720000::I know there's a couple of, you know, maybe a couple of people out there
0:56:33.720000 - 0:56:36.280000::that are listening to this for the first time.
0:56:36.280000 - 0:56:37.280000::Welcome.
0:56:37.280000 - 0:56:38.760000::I feel like we don't say that enough.
0:56:38.760000 - 0:56:40.600000::Welcome to the welcome.
0:56:40.600000 - 0:56:43.640000::We appreciate you sticking around this far.
0:56:43.640000 - 0:56:50.560000::And just to let you know, the episodes get better and better.
0:56:50.560000 - 0:56:55.280000::And if you want to immediately give us $5 a month,
0:56:55.280000 - 0:56:57.760000::you get extra episode every single week.
0:56:57.760000 - 0:56:58.560000::And guess what?
0:56:58.560000 - 0:57:01.120000::The Patreon episodes are even better.
0:57:01.120000 - 0:57:03.960000::I know that's hard to believe and hard to fathom something
0:57:03.960000 - 0:57:06::being better than what you're just listening to now.
0:57:06 - 0:57:08.240000::Is this a Patreon episode?
0:57:08.240000 - 0:57:10.400000::No, it's not.
0:57:10.400000 - 0:57:11.920000::Are you sure?
0:57:11.920000 - 0:57:12.440000::I'm positive.

1:02:39 - 1:02:45.580000::Did the beard and it something about not having the haircut but just getting lined up felt like I was paying for ASMR
1:02:46.080000 - 1:02:48.080000::Because you go in there and it's just
1:02:49.840000 - 1:02:52::This is one of the best experiences I've ever had
1:02:53 - 1:02:59.080000::He smells like aftershave he feels like he's from the 1950s. He says two words to me
1:02:59.800000 - 1:03:05::He's going in he's lining it up then he takes the straight edge
1:03:05.720000 - 1:03:11.920000::Razor right? Oh, he gives the thing in barberside then he gets the single use razor out clips it in there and he goes
1:03:11.920000 - 1:03:18.240000::And then he starts shaving down the back of my neck and that feeling I'm getting like goose bumps the whole time
1:03:18.240000 - 1:03:22.320000::I just I feel him. He's probably weirded out by how I'm acting
1:03:22.800000 - 1:03:25.280000::But it was so nice and pleasurable

1:03:39.320000 - 1:03:40.820000::I might say
1:03:40.820000 - 1:03:48::What's funny is during what you were just saying I wonder if you'll be able to hear that birdie the cat walked in
1:03:48.920000 - 1:03:54.840000::She's usually too afraid to walk into the office, but she walked in and hissed at me twice and then left
1:03:55.560000 - 1:03:57.560000::That was funny Wow

1:04:39.640000 - 1:04:47.240000::We ate the whole frickin thing down to the crumbles at the end and so it's funny thinking about
1:04:47.240000 - 1:04:52.320000::It's wasteful because you can't dip those in salsa anymore
1:04:52.520000 - 1:04:59.880000::But who wants to have all these crumblies so I'm just thinking there's got to be an invention that will be a tortilla rehydrator and recombiner

1:05:00 - 1:05:05.120000::something for the bottom end of the chips that are going to waste. And it's funny saying this now
