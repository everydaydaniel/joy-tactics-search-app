0:04:01.040000 - 0:04:05.040000::But actually, it wouldn't because we're being so interesting to listen to.
0:04:05.040000 - 0:04:07.040000::Sometimes interesting things put you to sleep.
0:04:07.040000 - 0:04:08.040000::Yeah.
0:04:08.040000 - 0:04:09.040000::That's right.

0:04:54.840000 - 0:04:58.840000::I was like Harry Potter under a fucking cupboard in the orphanage.
0:04:58.840000 - 0:04:59.840000::In nobody else.

0:05:00 - 0:05:02.400000::Now I'm finally standing up for myself.
0:05:02.400000 - 0:05:04.160000::The Harry Potter gets struck on the head with lightning.
0:05:04.160000 - 0:05:05::That's how he got this.
0:05:05 - 0:05:07.520000::Oh, it stands by a one by Voldemort.
0:05:07.520000 - 0:05:09.320000::Oh, Voldemort.

0:05:12.600000 - 0:05:15.520000::as good in movies like that?
0:05:15.520000 - 0:05:17.760000::There's no person who just comes in and lets them have it.
0:05:17.760000 - 0:05:18.960000::Voldemort, what's up?
0:05:18.960000 - 0:05:20.840000::Little salamander nose looking guy.
0:05:20.840000 - 0:05:21.680000::Oh my.
0:05:21.680000 - 0:05:24.360000::If Voldemort was here right now, we'd be laughing
0:05:24.360000 - 0:05:25.840000::as I was out of nowhere.
0:05:25.840000 - 0:05:27.840000::Oh, dude, you look like that.
0:05:27.840000 - 0:05:28.800000::Oh, shit.
0:05:28.800000 - 0:05:31.640000::You should be in the hospital, dude.
0:05:31.640000 - 0:05:32.480000::For real.
0:05:32.480000 - 0:05:34.680000::You need a little color on you.
0:05:34.680000 - 0:05:36.400000::You look disgusting.
0:05:36.400000 - 0:05:40.680000::I would go like this, fucking try to capture somebody's nose.
0:05:40.680000 - 0:05:42.200000::And I would be like, oh, shit.
0:05:42.200000 - 0:05:44.400000::There's nothing there, man.
0:05:44.400000 - 0:05:45.400000::Oh, man.
0:05:45.400000 - 0:05:46.920000::I want to take out a little blue wand.
0:05:46.920000 - 0:05:48.840000::I would say get that the fuck out of here.
0:05:48.840000 - 0:05:52.640000::I put my fingers in his nose and drag him around like a fish.
0:05:52.640000 - 0:05:53.600000::Yeah, the fucking.
0:05:53.600000 - 0:05:55.680000::And you don't fuck Harry Potter one more time,
0:05:55.680000 - 0:05:57.040000::because he's trying his best.
0:05:57.040000 - 0:05:58.040000::And he's lost enough.
0:05:58.040000 - 0:06:00.520000::Nobody's beating ass in fucking Harry Potter.
0:06:00.520000 - 0:06:01.600000::Like they all have their wands.
0:06:01.600000 - 0:06:02.840000::It's children.
0:06:02.840000 - 0:06:03.840000::It's children.
0:06:03.840000 - 0:06:05.120000::I would smack him with a mask.
0:06:05.120000 - 0:06:08.320000::You fucking fucking kick a 300 kick on somebody's chest.
0:06:08.320000 - 0:06:09.560000::And don't let him get up.
0:06:09.560000 - 0:06:11.400000::Get a fucking shovel and smack him on the head.
0:06:11.400000 - 0:06:13.080000::And that's fucking game over.
0:06:13.080000 - 0:06:15.440000::You get in your hands and put spells on you.
0:06:15.440000 - 0:06:16.520000::Drive into someone's house.
0:06:16.520000 - 0:06:17.360000::Good.
0:06:17.360000 - 0:06:18.200000::Yeah.
0:06:18.200000 - 0:06:18.880000::They have cars in Harry Potter.
0:06:18.880000 - 0:06:20.400000::Oh, they got flying cars, dude.
0:06:20.400000 - 0:06:20.920000::Really?

0:06:22.040000 - 0:06:23.360000::I don't obsess with muggles.
0:06:23.360000 - 0:06:24.520000::Are they all, dude?
0:06:24.520000 - 0:06:25.360000::I don't.
0:06:25.360000 - 0:06:26.440000::But it's going to give me into Harry Potter lore,
0:06:26.440000 - 0:06:28.400000::because you know, I don't fuck with Harry Potter anymore.
0:06:28.400000 - 0:06:30.040000::But you know, I'm saying.
0:06:30.040000 - 0:06:31.080000::Yeah, I know what you're saying.

0:06:40.280000 - 0:06:43.240000::I've been asking for this shit for a long ass time.
0:06:43.240000 - 0:06:47::We had another topic, but that was probably way more interesting
0:06:47 - 0:06:49.800000::than this, but Eric was like, who we just make it about my fucking
0:06:49.800000 - 0:06:50.800000::birthday.
0:06:50.800000 - 0:06:51.800000::Just for once.
0:06:51.800000 - 0:06:52.560000::Yeah.
0:06:52.560000 - 0:06:56.080000::You know, a birthday is a celebration of someone's life.
0:06:56.080000 - 0:07:01.040000::And that's today we're celebrating Eric Rahill, one of one of my best friends on the
0:07:01.040000 - 0:07:05.280000::planet, one of the funniest people ever to do it.
0:07:05.280000 - 0:07:09.200000::Literally, there's nobody on the world that makes me laugh more than Eric Rahill.
0:07:09.200000 - 0:07:10.720000::He's one of the goats.
0:07:10.720000 - 0:07:11.720000::He's one.
0:07:11.720000 - 0:07:15.800000::He will be his name will be up in the lights on forever.
0:07:15.800000 - 0:07:17.440000::He will be known for something.
0:07:17.440000 - 0:07:18.440000::For something.
0:07:18.440000 - 0:07:22.200000::Yeah, we don't know if it's an entertainment or something violent, but something's going
0:07:22.200000 - 0:07:24.600000::to snap at some point soon for something.
0:07:24.600000 - 0:07:25.600000::I appreciate that brother.
0:07:25.600000 - 0:07:29.360000::He got something dark, but yeah.
0:07:29.360000 - 0:07:30.360000::How does that feel?
0:07:30.360000 - 0:07:31.360000::How does that fit?
0:07:31.360000 - 0:07:35.440000::Well, you know, when Nate gives me a compliment, I'm feeling like I feel butterflies.
0:07:35.440000 - 0:07:39.200000::One time Leila had all my friends write me letters.
0:07:39.200000 - 0:07:43.520000::You guys did this and you guys' letters made me basically cry.
0:07:43.520000 - 0:07:47.720000::I'm sitting there reading these letters from all of my friends and I was like, good, come
0:07:47.720000 - 0:07:48.720000::on now.
0:07:48.720000 - 0:07:49.720000::You know what I'm saying?
0:07:49.720000 - 0:07:50.720000::There's nothing like a good friend.
0:07:50.720000 - 0:07:51.720000::There's nothing like a good friend.
0:07:51.720000 - 0:07:53.400000::You're listening right now and you have a friend.
0:07:53.400000 - 0:07:54.400000::Go write them a letter.
0:07:54.400000 - 0:07:55.400000::Go write them a letter.
0:07:55.400000 - 0:07:56.720000::I don't know how long they got on this earth.
0:07:56.720000 - 0:07:59.960000::One of us probably has a ticking time bomb in our bodies, right?
0:07:59.960000 - 0:08:00.960000::Mission Impossible style.
0:08:00.960000 - 0:08:03.200000::And you don't know I got some of that shit.
0:08:03.200000 - 0:08:06.200000::I know I got one of those things beeping in my fucking nose, right?
0:08:06.200000 - 0:08:07.200000::Yeah.
0:08:07.200000 - 0:08:08.200000::It could be 10 years.
0:08:08.200000 - 0:08:09.760000::It could be 10 days, 10 hours.
0:08:09.760000 - 0:08:11::It could be 10 seconds.
0:08:11 - 0:08:12::So do it.
0:08:12 - 0:08:13::Write, write, write.
0:08:13 - 0:08:14.640000::Pause this shit and go write your friend a letter and come back.
0:08:14.640000 - 0:08:17.040000::My brother just saw someone die on an airplane.
0:08:17.040000 - 0:08:21.040000::Well, so you don't know when it's going to, well, you don't know when God's going to take
0:08:21.040000 - 0:08:22.040000::you.
0:08:22.040000 - 0:08:26.360000::Don't watch jaws and some people, hell of people get die in that.
0:08:26.360000 - 0:08:28.360000::Death is all around us.
0:08:28.360000 - 0:08:32.760000::It's constantly invading our brain space and it's a good reminder.
0:08:32.760000 - 0:08:33.760000::Yeah.
0:08:33.760000 - 0:08:37.920000::It's a good reminder to do to view yourself when you're going to die.
0:08:37.920000 - 0:08:38.920000::All right.
0:08:38.920000 - 0:08:40.720000::This is something of the tool that you can use.
0:08:40.720000 - 0:08:45.480000::You can view yourself at your deathbed and look at yourself dying.
0:08:45.480000 - 0:08:46.480000::Everyone do that, Eric.
0:08:46.480000 - 0:08:47.480000::Jack.
0:08:47.480000 - 0:08:48.800000::I don't need a reminder.
0:08:48.800000 - 0:08:50.440000::I don't need a reminder to do that.
0:08:50.440000 - 0:08:54.040000::I'm doing that every time I do anything.
0:08:54.040000 - 0:08:58.440000::But you got to look at yourself when you're 96 years old, Eric will probably be in his
0:08:58.440000 - 0:08:59.920000::early 50s when he's gone.
0:08:59.920000 - 0:09:03.680000::According to my family history, it'll be the 40s probably the way I'm living.
0:09:03.680000 - 0:09:07::Jack will be like 100 and a bio.
0:09:07 - 0:09:08::You'll live till 300.
0:09:08 - 0:09:09::They're going to lose track.
0:09:09 - 0:09:11::Yeah, they're going to lose track.
0:09:11 - 0:09:13::You're going to get over it.
0:09:13 - 0:09:14::Yeah.
0:09:14 - 0:09:17.760000::Even that man that they say is 146 years old or whatever, and he looks like a ghost.
0:09:17.760000 - 0:09:18.760000::Yeah.
0:09:18.760000 - 0:09:19.760000::That's going to be you.
0:09:19.760000 - 0:09:22.160000::He's that grandma from SpongeBob sitting in bed all like that.
0:09:22.160000 - 0:09:25.440000::But you'll be sitting in bed with a runescape with one of the oldest laptops anybody's
0:09:25.440000 - 0:09:26.440000::ever seen.
0:09:26.440000 - 0:09:28.440000::Join the clan chat.
0:09:28.440000 - 0:09:34.320000::But Jack, you'll be like, you'll be looking like so emaciated, so ancient like your body
0:09:34.320000 - 0:09:36.920000::just wants to wither and deteriorate.
0:09:36.920000 - 0:09:41.080000::But you can like literally move around to like a 25 year old.
0:09:41.080000 - 0:09:45.760000::Like you can like jump around and you're putting your head, your legs behind your head.
0:09:45.760000 - 0:09:48.080000::I'm going to be like a secret character in a video game.
0:09:48.080000 - 0:09:49.080000::Like, oh, why is that?
0:09:49.080000 - 0:09:53.160000::That doesn't look right for this world, but it moves the same as everybody else.
0:09:53.160000 - 0:09:54.160000::You're hitting the man, Jaina.
0:09:54.160000 - 0:09:55.160000::I'm hitting the man.
0:09:55.160000 - 0:09:56.160000::I'm putting the man, Jaina.

0:12:47.440000 - 0:12:49.080000::and then after dinner, we're supposed to get it.
0:12:49.080000 - 0:12:50.240000::So you know who this person is?
0:12:50.240000 - 0:12:51.240000::I think so.

0:12:55.360000 - 0:12:58.640000::And he said, dude, you gotta fucking come up to Nova Scotia.
0:12:58.640000 - 0:13:00::I have a place there.
0:13:00 - 0:13:02.480000::And if you ever want to use it, literally just hit me up.
0:13:02.480000 - 0:13:03.880000::Like you can stay there, we're never going to ever.
0:13:03.880000 - 0:13:05.920000::We just met, we didn't talk at all at dinner
0:13:05.920000 - 0:13:06.840000::and he's telling me this shit.
0:13:06.840000 - 0:13:09.960000::I'm like, who do I hit up to go stay here, cabin?
0:13:09.960000 - 0:13:12.160000::Don't think it's going to happen.
0:13:12.160000 - 0:13:15.920000::This is a warning to people like that who are going to offer.
0:13:15.920000 - 0:13:18.200000::Like you know, you say that and you just,
0:13:18.200000 - 0:13:20.080000::it's just like a gesture of goodwill.
0:13:20.080000 - 0:13:21.080000::Right.
0:13:21.080000 - 0:13:22.680000::You don't actually, but I take shit literally.
0:13:22.680000 - 0:13:23.680000::That's how I was raised.
0:13:23.680000 - 0:13:24.720000::But that's the celebrity version.
0:13:24.720000 - 0:13:26.720000::But that's the celebrity version.
0:13:26.720000 - 0:13:28.800000::Instead of being like, oh, hey, yeah, we should get dinner
0:13:28.800000 - 0:13:29.800000::sometimes.
0:13:29.800000 - 0:13:32.200000::He's like, oh, stay at my home in another country
0:13:32.200000 - 0:13:33.200000::in another time.
0:13:33.200000 - 0:13:34.200000::Me, wow.
0:13:34.200000 - 0:13:36.080000::Now, that's funny.
0:13:36.080000 - 0:13:37::I'd love to stay there.
0:13:37 - 0:13:39.400000::Too bad you've intentionally set your country on fire
0:13:39.400000 - 0:13:40.800000::to blow smoke down into ours.
0:13:40.800000 - 0:13:41.800000::Oh my God.
0:13:41.800000 - 0:13:43.200000::Canada, stop it now.
0:13:43.200000 - 0:13:45.200000::Canada, reverse the smoke now.
0:13:45.200000 - 0:13:48.640000::I think what's happening is the MNTP, whatever they call it.
0:13:48.640000 - 0:13:52.440000::MNTP is setting fires in the forest to fucking smoke out
0:13:52.440000 - 0:13:53.640000::people in the big cities.
0:13:53.640000 - 0:13:55.320000::OK, happy to be actors and writers.
0:13:55.320000 - 0:13:56.440000::Should we tell everybody?
0:13:56.440000 - 0:13:58.600000::Yeah, we're all sag.
0:13:58.600000 - 0:14:02.040000::In case we are making the announcement right now.

0:14:18.520000 - 0:14:19.320000::Shut that shit down.
0:14:19.320000 - 0:14:24.560000::So no more Panther 3, no more Jumanji 8, no more.
0:14:24.560000 - 0:14:26.160000::Whatever else has actors in it.
0:14:26.160000 - 0:14:29.680000::I was fucking on set with who they're saying.
0:14:29.680000 - 0:14:31.720000::I don't want to out him, but it's Chris Pratt.
0:14:31.720000 - 0:14:34.400000::And we were in the most emotional scene you can imagine.
0:14:34.400000 - 0:14:35.720000::Our faces are this close.
0:14:35.720000 - 0:14:37.640000::Our eyes are locked in ways that you can't.
0:14:37.640000 - 0:14:40.080000::And everybody's on set's crying.
0:14:40.080000 - 0:14:42.120000::The A.D. says, we're striking.
0:14:42.120000 - 0:14:45.080000::And I'm like, this scene will fucking get us Oscar time.
0:14:45.080000 - 0:14:46.400000::We'll be in front of millions of people.
0:14:46.400000 - 0:14:48.840000::People all over the world will be crying when they see this.
0:14:48.840000 - 0:14:50.360000::I said, I'm out, dude.
0:14:50.360000 - 0:14:50.960000::Let's go.
0:14:50.960000 - 0:14:52.080000::I fucking got all the actors.
0:14:52.080000 - 0:14:52.440000::We got it.
0:14:52.440000 - 0:14:54.280000::We went out and we went to dinner.
0:14:54.280000 - 0:14:57.560000::And that's how much I care about this is that I fucking.
0:14:57.560000 - 0:14:59.320000::This is ruining Eric's career.
0:14:59.320000 - 0:15:01.080000::It is ruining.

0:15:00 - 0:15:03::And this could not have happened at a worst time for me personally.
0:15:03 - 0:15:07::Right as my career is like on a fucking rocket to ship to space.
0:15:07 - 0:15:10::And you just got diagnosis that's saying like it's this year, it's over.
0:15:10 - 0:15:15::Basically I got a new type of skin diagnosis that is.
0:15:15 - 0:15:19::That is going to end my life. It's going to end my acting career for sure.
0:15:19 - 0:15:21::Yeah, you'll be around, but you're not going to look good.
0:15:21 - 0:15:23::You're not going to want to look at my eyes.
0:15:23 - 0:15:26::And I was doing the opposite. I was on set. I was directing.
0:15:26 - 0:15:28::You know me. I'm filmmaker in my heart.
0:15:28 - 0:15:33::And I all of a sudden they say, uh oh, sag everybody's on strike, whatever, whatever.
0:15:33 - 0:15:34::I go, oh really?
0:15:34 - 0:15:38::I lock all the doors, chain it all shut.
0:15:38 - 0:15:42::I'm not going to say Virginia textile, but in some way I chain all the doors shut.
0:15:42 - 0:15:46::Nobody's getting out of here until this fucking movie is done.
0:15:46 - 0:15:50::Are you crazy? Are you crazy? You and you signed the contract.
0:15:50 - 0:15:54::You can't get out. I lock those fools in and guess what?
0:15:54 - 0:15:56::CGI Friday's feature film.
0:15:56 - 0:15:58::That's going to be fucking amazing.
0:15:58 - 0:16:02::That's what tears me apart though is I want to honor unions.
0:16:02 - 0:16:06::I like unions. If they're, they're acting right.
0:16:06 - 0:16:08::But I also honor contracts.
0:16:08 - 0:16:12::I in a way that nobody else does seems to these days.
0:16:12 - 0:16:15::Well, if I sign a contract, I'm reading every dude.
0:16:15 - 0:16:16::What is that?
0:16:16 - 0:16:19::Social contract that I'm not going to fucking into in the head.
0:16:19 - 0:16:22::That's a social side of social contract that we signed.
0:16:22 - 0:16:24::I mean to scare you.
0:16:24 - 0:16:26::You can't scare me anymore, dude.
0:16:26 - 0:16:28::Look at that reflexes though.
0:16:28 - 0:16:30::You kind of barely cock back.
0:16:30 - 0:16:32::No, you always kind of like it.
0:16:32 - 0:16:36::If fucking Mike Tyson came to my head, it's like this.
0:16:36 - 0:16:40::If you're listening to this, I'm barely moving my head.
0:16:40 - 0:16:44::So perfectly precise that nobody can punch me.
0:16:44 - 0:16:46::Right. Mike Tyson.
0:16:46 - 0:16:50::Do you think I can smack it within like two like this?
0:16:50 - 0:16:52::I just smell it.
0:16:52 - 0:16:54::I just smell the hand.
0:16:54 - 0:16:56::You want to smell them?
0:16:56 - 0:17:00::That's what I do if someone gets tries to get up and me smell them so amazing.
0:17:00 - 0:17:04::So if you're in a boxing ring, you just be sniffing all that.
0:17:07 - 0:17:09::Smell on their neck.
0:17:09 - 0:17:12::Oh my god. If they release the fucking mics, the ring mics.
0:17:12 - 0:17:14::What's he doing? Why's he?
0:17:14 - 0:17:17::That's why you need to study your opponent because you could have up her hand in it.
0:17:17 - 0:17:19::I take your hand in like some ball sacks or something like that.
0:17:19 - 0:17:21::You got to get that and then just you.
0:17:21 - 0:17:24::Hey, you got this stinky gun and you got this stinky fucking fist.
0:17:24 - 0:17:26::Here's the strategy.
0:17:26 - 0:17:28::We give him two rounds of sniffing.
0:17:28 - 0:17:29::He's not going to hit back.
0:17:29 - 0:17:31::After two rounds of sniffing, he's going to know everything he needs to know.
0:17:31 - 0:17:33::Round three is going to start licking him, tasting him.
0:17:33 - 0:17:35::Round four, then he's going to get knocked out.
0:17:35 - 0:17:37::Then there's water sports.
0:17:37 - 0:17:39::What?
0:17:39 - 0:17:41::Pizz and all over.
0:17:41 - 0:17:44::If you could like control your piece so well,
0:17:44 - 0:17:46::where you just send a little shot out.
0:17:46 - 0:17:48::Did I have a dream?
0:17:48 - 0:17:50::That's what dogs basically do.
0:17:50 - 0:17:55::Dogs have just, they save their pee just to kind of spray on a little tree to mark their little spot.
0:17:55 - 0:17:58::They have to be a real control like no other animal.
0:17:58 - 0:17:59::Reveality.
0:17:59 - 0:18:01::They can do it from 100 yards away like I'm training to do.
0:18:01 - 0:18:03::Oh, you trying to get out to the fucking trees over there.
0:18:03 - 0:18:05::I'm trying to do it Chris Angel style.
0:18:05 - 0:18:10::Where he trained, or David Blaine where he trained to learn how to puke up water like a crazy heart.
0:18:10 - 0:18:12::Oh, I'm going to do that with my.
0:18:12 - 0:18:17::Magicians beware if you're too close to me and you try to trick me.
0:18:17 - 0:18:19::I take that shit seriously.
0:18:19 - 0:18:24::I am not going to be tricked again after I got tricked big time a few years ago.
0:18:24 - 0:18:31::I want to see you like somebody, a David Blaine or something like it's like a celebrity is doing magic.
0:18:31 - 0:18:34::Our David Blaine does magic for celebrities.
0:18:34 - 0:18:37::You're in your kind of granite countertop mansion.
0:18:37 - 0:18:38::Yeah.
0:18:38 - 0:18:42::And he comes over and he puts like a nail through his chest.
0:18:42 - 0:18:50::And as soon as he does that, I want you to like just full on like no matter who stopping you like choke him out to death.
0:18:50 - 0:18:56::I'm taking my blender, both out my old timey gun and into right to the bottom of the chin.
0:18:56 - 0:19:00::One of those tricks me or my family or my friends.
0:19:00 - 0:19:05::One time Eric was at a magic show and they he volunteered to get sawed in half.
0:19:05 - 0:19:07::He didn't believe it and they saw them in half.
0:19:07 - 0:19:12::And Eric basically started crying in ways that was more humiliating than you can imagine.
0:19:12 - 0:19:16::Yeah, that's why I'm not trying to get out of the box.
0:19:16 - 0:19:24::Stuck in the box trying to get out of the box not working.
0:19:24 - 0:19:28::That would suck so bad to get sawed in half.
0:19:28 - 0:19:29::Are you kidding my ass?
0:19:29 - 0:19:31::Can you imagine that really?
0:19:31 - 0:19:32::No.
0:19:32 - 0:19:34::Which half would you want to be for the rest of your life?
0:19:34 - 0:19:35::I'll put a lower.
0:19:35 - 0:19:38::You are smart, smart pair of legs.
0:19:38 - 0:19:40::Oh, you're a celebrity immediately.
0:19:40 - 0:19:41::There's no left.
0:19:41 - 0:19:44::I have to be that smart because legs is not that many smart of them.
0:19:44 - 0:19:46::So you just be the first one.
0:19:46 - 0:19:47::Yeah.
0:19:47 - 0:19:48::Yeah.
0:19:48 - 0:19:51::So the first leg, whatever first leg sound designer.

0:30:10.280000 - 0:30:11.120000::Am I lying?
0:30:11.120000 - 0:30:12.520000::No, you're not lying at all.
0:30:12.520000 - 0:30:14.640000::We woke up early for this one.
0:30:14.640000 - 0:30:17.840000::And what makes me so proud of us is that,
0:30:17.840000 - 0:30:21.160000::what do you think like Tom Sagar is doing right now?
0:30:21.160000 - 0:30:22.440000::Dude, sleeping.
0:30:22.440000 - 0:30:23.280000::Sleeping.
0:30:23.280000 - 0:30:24.120000::His asses sleep.
0:30:24.120000 - 0:30:24.960000::They are lazy.
0:30:24.960000 - 0:30:26.080000::Daniel Craig is doing right now.
0:30:26.080000 - 0:30:26.920000::Sleeping.
0:30:26.920000 - 0:30:27.760000::Sleeping.
0:30:27.760000 - 0:30:31.320000::He's with his wife.
0:30:31.320000 - 0:30:33.560000::And so what's funny is we're working.
0:30:33.560000 - 0:30:36.880000::And what that tells me is that in 10 years,
0:30:36.880000 - 0:30:40.120000::all this time that we've been podcasting at 5 in the morning,
0:30:40.120000 - 0:30:42.880000::that's when I'm going to go take my fucking Bugatti
0:30:42.880000 - 0:30:45.120000::and drive this shit right into my principal's house
0:30:45.120000 - 0:30:47.120000::from when I was not as good.
0:30:47.120000 - 0:30:49.520000::Bugatti, you're trying to get a house?
0:30:49.520000 - 0:30:50.360000::Yep.
0:30:50.360000 - 0:30:50.880000::Yeah.
0:30:50.880000 - 0:30:51.720000::Here's what you do.
0:30:51.720000 - 0:30:54.880000::You take the Bugatti, you fill it down in my fucking ass
0:30:54.880000 - 0:30:56.480000::stew on you that protects you.
0:30:56.480000 - 0:30:57.760000::You go blow up your enemies house.
0:30:57.760000 - 0:30:59.600000::He put on a helmet and goggles.
0:30:59.600000 - 0:31:01.680000::You fucking have a fucking suitcase of cash
0:31:01.680000 - 0:31:03.920000::that's at least the cost of the house plus a little extra.
0:31:03.920000 - 0:31:06.400000::And some people, you're fucking take this.
0:31:06.400000 - 0:31:08.560000::I just had to do this for my own self.
0:31:08.560000 - 0:31:10.400000::Hope nobody got her piece.
0:31:10.400000 - 0:31:12.040000::Let me get that scenario.
0:31:12.040000 - 0:31:13.080000::All right.
0:31:13.080000 - 0:31:16.680000::So you had a guidance counselor in high school.
0:31:16.680000 - 0:31:17.200000::Yeah.
0:31:17.200000 - 0:31:24.400000::That was just told you, they would bring you into their office
0:31:24.400000 - 0:31:25.720000::and they would say, you will never.
0:31:25.720000 - 0:31:29::I want to tell you Eric and Jack, like you guys both
0:31:29 - 0:31:31.360000::individually will amount to nothing.
0:31:31.360000 - 0:31:33.400000::And they were the person that were just bringing you down.
0:31:33.400000 - 0:31:35.200000::Don't even go to fucking college.
0:31:35.200000 - 0:31:36.480000::Don't even go anywhere.
0:31:36.480000 - 0:31:38.280000::Your dreams will never happen.
0:31:38.280000 - 0:31:39.840000::Go become a fucking plumber.
0:31:39.840000 - 0:31:41.360000::It's never going to work out for you.
0:31:41.360000 - 0:31:43.480000::I know my grandpa was a plumber.
0:31:43.480000 - 0:31:45.040000::So don't fucking joke about that.
0:31:45.040000 - 0:31:45.560000::OK.
0:31:45.560000 - 0:31:46.280000::Well, just let me.
0:31:46.280000 - 0:31:48.240000::And I had a guidance counselor like this, who I've both
0:31:48.240000 - 0:31:49.640000::have called me fat.
0:31:49.640000 - 0:31:52.080000::This is a scenario.
0:31:52.080000 - 0:31:55.920000::You are now 55 years old.
0:31:55.920000 - 0:31:58::And it is finally happening.
0:31:58 - 0:31:59.320000::55.
0:31:59.320000 - 0:32:02.200000::Oh, that's old age.
0:32:02.200000 - 0:32:04.160000::We have a lot of people in the ages of it.
0:32:04.160000 - 0:32:07.800000::I mean, I want to apologize to you guys directly to camera.
0:32:07.800000 - 0:32:08.600000::I don't come at me.
0:32:08.600000 - 0:32:09.560000::What's it like in a nursing?
0:32:09.560000 - 0:32:11.440000::They're listening in the nursing home.
0:32:11.440000 - 0:32:12.680000::55.
0:32:12.680000 - 0:32:14.400000::I mean 60, whatever.
0:32:14.400000 - 0:32:15.200000::OK.
0:32:15.200000 - 0:32:16.680000::But this is.
0:32:16.680000 - 0:32:17.480000::Listen.
0:32:17.480000 - 0:32:18.160000::What is it?
0:32:18.160000 - 0:32:18.920000::So OK.
0:32:18.920000 - 0:32:20.400000::So you're 55.
0:32:20.400000 - 0:32:24.160000::And you are like, I'm going to go to my guidance counselor's
0:32:24.160000 - 0:32:24.680000::house.
0:32:24.680000 - 0:32:28.480000::I'm going to fucking pop a nine in their fucking face for fucking
0:32:28.480000 - 0:32:29.480000::with me.
0:32:29.480000 - 0:32:30.480000::I'm up 900 in their face.
0:32:30.480000 - 0:32:31.920000::So you go to their house.
0:32:31.920000 - 0:32:32.440000::All right.
0:32:32.440000 - 0:32:33.440000::You have their address.
0:32:33.440000 - 0:32:34.440000::You knock on their door.
0:32:34.440000 - 0:32:35.440000::You open it up.
0:32:35.440000 - 0:32:39.360000::And you see a 99 year old emaciated.
0:32:39.360000 - 0:32:40.920000::Mushrooms grow all around their head.
0:32:40.920000 - 0:32:42.720000::They have a caretaker with them.
0:32:42.720000 - 0:32:45.280000::And they have a Bible next to them.
0:32:45.280000 - 0:32:48.080000::They've obviously made some changes in their life.
0:32:48.080000 - 0:32:50.840000::And are you going to pop that trigger on this?
0:32:50.840000 - 0:32:51.360000::What?
0:32:51.360000 - 0:32:52.880000::You're a nine year old man.
0:32:52.880000 - 0:32:53.720000::Here's what you fucking.
0:32:53.720000 - 0:32:54.920000::Who doesn't even remember you?
0:32:54.920000 - 0:32:56.720000::Who doesn't remember this instance?
0:32:56.720000 - 0:32:58.040000::But you do.
0:32:58.040000 - 0:32:58.920000::I come back.
0:32:58.920000 - 0:32:59.120000::OK.
0:32:59.120000 - 0:33:00.880000::So their mind is all out.
0:33:00.880000 - 0:33:01.960000::Hi.
0:33:01.960000 - 0:33:03.560000::Hi, Mr. Seymour.
0:33:03.560000 - 0:33:05.320000::The really my counselor's name.
0:33:05.320000 - 0:33:06.440000::How are you?
0:33:06.440000 - 0:33:07.200000::Good to see you.
0:33:07.200000 - 0:33:08.680000::Do you remember me?
0:33:08.680000 - 0:33:10.800000::You meant so much to me in high school.
0:33:10.800000 - 0:33:11.720000::You changed my life.
0:33:11.720000 - 0:33:13.280000::You put me on a good track.
0:33:13.280000 - 0:33:15.160000::What?
0:33:15.160000 - 0:33:16.160000::Break his toes.
0:33:17.160000 - 0:33:18.280000::To turn them all inside out.
0:33:18.280000 - 0:33:19.120000::Sorry about that.
0:33:19.120000 - 0:33:20.240000::It didn't mean to.
0:33:20.240000 - 0:33:21.720000::Oh, I can't even feel them.
0:33:21.720000 - 0:33:25.480000::Then I take his ass into my fucking whip.
0:33:25.480000 - 0:33:27.560000::I take him to the fucking science facility.
0:33:27.560000 - 0:33:28.720000::I bring him back.
0:33:28.720000 - 0:33:32.160000::Because by then, AI is made available for us to D.A.
0:33:32.160000 - 0:33:33.680000::We're like, I've been talking about before.
0:33:33.680000 - 0:33:35.520000::I bring him back to fucking 30 years old.
0:33:35.520000 - 0:33:39.560000::This procedure costs $40 million.
0:33:39.560000 - 0:33:40.120000::He's back.
0:33:40.120000 - 0:33:40.880000::He's like feeling good.
0:33:40.880000 - 0:33:43.080000::The fucking flesh is getting all unwrinkly.
0:33:43.080000 - 0:33:45.800000::Inflation is probably like five years.
0:33:45.800000 - 0:33:47.200000::Yeah, maybe five years.
0:33:47.200000 - 0:33:48.520000::But then so he's back to life.
0:33:48.520000 - 0:33:50.440000::He's like so excited to be alive again.
0:33:50.440000 - 0:33:52.320000::I'm like, you feel good, Mr. Seymour.
0:33:52.320000 - 0:33:53.400000::Are you back to life?
0:33:53.400000 - 0:33:54.480000::You want to go crazy?
0:33:54.480000 - 0:33:55.320000::Go party?
0:33:55.320000 - 0:33:56.240000::Go hook up with some girls?
0:33:56.240000 - 0:33:57.880000::Yeah, I want to do that.
0:33:57.880000 - 0:33:59.120000::That's when the shovel gets right.
0:33:59.120000 - 0:34:01.440000::And the fucking smack with the shovel.
0:34:01.440000 - 0:34:02.960000::Disfigure him.
0:34:02.960000 - 0:34:04.200000::And then, but I let him live.
0:34:04.200000 - 0:34:06.440000::All this figured as a 30 year old.
0:34:06.440000 - 0:34:07.280000::That's dark.
0:34:07.280000 - 0:34:08.440000::And then you let him go on.
0:34:08.440000 - 0:34:09.280000::Yeah.
0:34:09.280000 - 0:34:10.280000::We torture him.
0:34:10.280000 - 0:34:11.680000::That's a lie.
0:34:11.680000 - 0:34:12.960000::You give him a punch right?
0:34:12.960000 - 0:34:13.800000::I know, dude.
0:34:13.800000 - 0:34:15.080000::You give him a pruning injury.
0:34:15.080000 - 0:34:17.400000::I'm, I'm, thank God I play on the good guys team.
0:34:17.400000 - 0:34:18.400000::You know what I'm saying?
0:34:18.400000 - 0:34:19.400000::Thank God you guys.
0:34:19.400000 - 0:34:20.400000::That's what you think.
0:34:20.400000 - 0:34:21.400000::That's what you think.
0:34:21.400000 - 0:34:22.400000::What?
0:34:22.400000 - 0:34:24.880000::It's very scary because you don't know if you really are on the good guys team or not.
0:34:24.880000 - 0:34:26.400000::Oh, I fucking know.
0:34:26.400000 - 0:34:27.400000::Okay.
0:34:27.400000 - 0:34:28.400000::I've been told.
0:34:28.400000 - 0:34:29.400000::Well, you don't.
0:34:29.400000 - 0:34:30.400000::By my handlers.
0:34:30.400000 - 0:34:33.560000::My fucking, the government handlers told me, you're doing good, dude.
0:34:33.560000 - 0:34:34.560000::It's okay.
0:34:34.560000 - 0:34:35.560000::All right.
0:34:35.560000 - 0:34:36.560000::Now here's the tip to that.
0:34:36.560000 - 0:34:37.560000::Here's how I torture the fuck out of my guy.
0:34:37.560000 - 0:34:39.560000::It's cancer for call me fat.
0:34:39.560000 - 0:34:40.560000::How did he call you fat?
0:34:40.560000 - 0:34:41.560000::He.
0:34:41.560000 - 0:34:42.560000::Oh, wow.
0:34:42.560000 - 0:34:44.640000::And you know, you always think women can't be mean.
0:34:44.640000 - 0:34:46.720000::But yeah, they can call people fat too.
0:34:46.720000 - 0:34:47.720000::I'll get you.
0:34:47.720000 - 0:34:49.720000::Those other ones will snap you mental.
0:34:49.720000 - 0:34:50.720000::So, snap you personally.
0:34:50.720000 - 0:34:51.720000::What did she do to you?
0:34:51.720000 - 0:34:54.680000::And what would you do to her for revenge?
0:34:54.680000 - 0:34:56.560000::And she didn't get me in the college.
0:34:56.560000 - 0:35:00.040000::I was supposed to go to Harvard, but I didn't get any good grades.

0:35:00 - 0:35:01.660000::it all so that I didn't.
0:35:01.660000 - 0:35:03.960000::Sender your cut of the Patreon or see every month.
0:35:03.960000 - 0:35:05::Here's what I'm gonna do.
0:35:05 - 0:35:13::I'm gonna go to her house when she's actually on her 99th birthday.
0:35:13 - 0:35:15::And her whole family is there to celebrate.
0:35:15 - 0:35:16::Okay.
0:35:16 - 0:35:21::And I walk in and I go, hey, and I have basically no meat on my bones.
0:35:21 - 0:35:23.520000::I'm covered in dirt.
0:35:23.520000 - 0:35:24.520000::What happened to you?
0:35:24.520000 - 0:35:25.520000::Oh, are you okay?
0:35:25.520000 - 0:35:26.520000::Who are you?
0:35:26.520000 - 0:35:27.520000::Did you go to college?
0:35:27.520000 - 0:35:28.520000::No, I didn't.
0:35:28.520000 - 0:35:31.320000::After a year, I applied and I got into a school.
0:35:31.320000 - 0:35:33.840000::No thanks to anybody here.
0:35:33.840000 - 0:35:35.800000::And I didn't finish.
0:35:35.800000 - 0:35:37.800000::No thanks to anybody here.
0:35:37.800000 - 0:35:38.800000::Yeah.
0:35:38.800000 - 0:35:44.560000::Then, and I'm gonna have two bowls of piping hot chicken noodle soup in my hand.
0:35:44.560000 - 0:35:45.560000::Be careful, dude.
0:35:45.560000 - 0:35:46.560000::Be careful.

0:35:55.720000 - 0:35:56.720000::What are you doing?
0:35:56.880000 - 0:35:59.840000::I just wanna eat some soup with her.
0:35:59.840000 - 0:36:01.040000::Oh, really?

0:36:09.920000 - 0:36:12.200000::All right, and we don't support the guys or vans.
0:36:12.200000 - 0:36:14.520000::Wait, when some instances you need them.
0:36:14.520000 - 0:36:16.280000::Because sometimes, as you guys know, sometimes the hardest thing
0:36:16.280000 - 0:36:18.160000::that I've ever do is the best thing you could have done.
0:36:18.160000 - 0:36:23.200000::So I sit down, face to face, cheek to cheek.

0:36:26.720000 - 0:36:27.560000::Fuck her.
0:36:29.560000 - 0:36:30.560000::Recipit on the soup.
0:36:30.560000 - 0:36:31.720000::That's scalding, huh?
0:36:31.720000 - 0:36:32.720000::Yeah.
0:36:32.720000 - 0:36:33.720000::This is like a Tarantino.
0:36:33.720000 - 0:36:34.560000::What the hell, dude?
0:36:34.560000 - 0:36:35.560000::I'm like, what the?

0:36:37.760000 - 0:36:38.880000::Badly, just sipping the soup.
0:36:38.880000 - 0:36:39.880000::She goes, who are you?
0:36:39.880000 - 0:36:40.720000::I go.
0:36:40.720000 - 0:36:44.720000::You fucking piece of shit.
0:36:48.120000 - 0:36:49.200000::Smack!

0:36:53.200000 - 0:36:54.800000::I go smack right in front of her head.
0:36:54.800000 - 0:36:55.640000::Yeah, yeah.
0:36:55.640000 - 0:36:57.600000::You know, I could have done that for real, right?
0:36:57.600000 - 0:36:58.640000::She goes, who are you?
0:36:58.640000 - 0:37:01.160000::Why did you kill all my family members in this way?
0:37:01.160000 - 0:37:02.440000::I'm turning 100, don't you know?
0:37:02.440000 - 0:37:03.560000::I go, I know.
0:37:03.560000 - 0:37:04.400000::Yeah.
0:37:06.520000 - 0:37:07.640000::I'm losing my mind.
0:37:07.640000 - 0:37:08.480000::Yeah.
0:37:08.480000 - 0:37:11.040000::I go, you're that motherfucker that called me fat and all that stuff.
0:37:11.040000 - 0:37:12.040000::Remember me?
0:37:12.040000 - 0:37:12.960000::And she goes, no.
0:37:12.960000 - 0:37:13.800000::Remember me.
0:37:13.800000 - 0:37:14.600000::And I go, what?
0:37:15.640000 - 0:37:18.120000::You don't remember me, even though I have put all this weight
0:37:18.120000 - 0:37:19.200000::to you in my head.
0:37:19.200000 - 0:37:21.080000::You don't remember me, though?
0:37:21.080000 - 0:37:23.360000::And then I had something to say.
0:37:23.360000 - 0:37:25.840000::I had some final thing to do to her.
0:37:25.840000 - 0:37:26.680000::Oh yeah.
0:37:26.680000 - 0:37:28.680000::So then what I'm going to do is, okay, well then,
0:37:28.680000 - 0:37:30.800000::I'm going to make you remember me.
0:37:30.800000 - 0:37:33.120000::So I'm going to put, what I'm basically going to do is,
0:37:33.120000 - 0:37:35.320000::you know how sometimes when you crack open a coconut
0:37:35.320000 - 0:37:36.800000::and then you rip it open?
0:37:36.800000 - 0:37:38.960000::So I'm going to put one hand on her bottom jaw,
0:37:38.960000 - 0:37:40.120000::one hand on the top.
0:37:41.600000 - 0:37:43.840000::Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
0:37:43.840000 - 0:37:44.600000::Oh, my God.
0:37:44.600000 - 0:37:45.600000::Yes.
0:37:45.600000 - 0:37:46.840000::Yeah, God, man.
0:37:46.840000 - 0:37:48.960000::I opened up her head like a coconut.
0:37:48.960000 - 0:37:50.760000::And I'm going to fucking slip her brain out
0:37:50.760000 - 0:37:51.600000::with a lot of confidence.
0:37:51.600000 - 0:37:52.440000::Oh, whoa.
0:37:52.720000 - 0:37:54.800000::I don't know you had it any like this, dude.
0:37:54.800000 - 0:37:57.480000::And then I'm going to get all the knowledge that she got
0:37:57.480000 - 0:37:58.920000::and I'm going to go to college.
0:37:58.920000 - 0:38:01.280000::So well, we get drunk.
0:38:01.280000 - 0:38:04.760000::So well, we spent, we get, you were going to train your tongue
0:38:04.760000 - 0:38:07.240000::to be immune to the scalding hot but soup
0:38:07.240000 - 0:38:09.800000::and make her drink some hot fucking soup and say,
0:38:10.840000 - 0:38:14.640000::you're just, you're cold toes just touch my, fit my hand.
0:38:14.640000 - 0:38:16.560000::Hey, let's do a toe tip.
0:38:16.560000 - 0:38:17.640000::I'm my socks on.
0:38:17.640000 - 0:38:19.280000::No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
0:38:19.280000 - 0:38:20.120000::I'm not my brick toe.

0:38:21.360000 - 0:38:22.400000::Please, man.
0:38:22.400000 - 0:38:23.400000::I'm going to get my knee put it on.
0:38:23.400000 - 0:38:24.400000::Here's what I would do.
0:38:25.640000 - 0:38:28.280000::I would knock on the door, knock, knock, knock.
0:38:28.280000 - 0:38:30.680000::You guys are bustin' open just shooting the fucking
0:38:30.680000 - 0:38:31.520000::everybody in there.
0:38:31.520000 - 0:38:32.360000::No, no, I'm not weighted.
0:38:32.360000 - 0:38:33.200000::Strategic.
0:38:33.200000 - 0:38:34.360000::I'm not crazy.
0:38:34.360000 - 0:38:36.520000::Knockin' on the door, knock, knock, knock.
0:38:36.520000 - 0:38:38.520000::Somebody comes in, it's probably going to take a long time
0:38:38.520000 - 0:38:40.800000::since they're 99 or their handler comes in.
0:38:42.160000 - 0:38:44.480000::And I go in a nice way.
0:38:45.440000 - 0:38:49.040000::I say, hey, Mr. Basinger,
0:38:49.040000 - 0:38:49.880000::Adele does it.
0:38:49.880000 - 0:38:51.880000::It's me, Nate.
0:38:51.880000 - 0:38:53.680000::I don't know if you remember me.
0:38:53.680000 - 0:38:56.200000::I just wanted to say that I'm really successful now.
0:38:56.200000 - 0:38:57.600000::And I'm in my 50s.
0:38:57.600000 - 0:39:00.760000::And before you doubted me, but actually,
0:39:02.360000 - 0:39:05.280000::I forgive you for what the fuck you said to me.
0:39:05.280000 - 0:39:06.320000::Oh.
0:39:06.320000 - 0:39:10.240000::And I want you to know that I don't hold any ill will towards you.
0:39:10.240000 - 0:39:11.840000::I didn't the past.
0:39:11.840000 - 0:39:14.800000::In the past I did, but right now I've healed from that.
0:39:14.800000 - 0:39:17.320000::And yes, I did use that as fuel earlier in my life,
0:39:17.320000 - 0:39:21.560000::but right now, I don't have any sort of trauma
0:39:21.560000 - 0:39:22.960000::or ill will towards you right now.
0:39:22.960000 - 0:39:24.400000::And I want you to live your best life.
0:39:24.400000 - 0:39:26.440000::And I'm actually happy for you right now.
0:39:26.440000 - 0:39:28.040000::And I want you to win and succeed.
0:39:28.040000 - 0:39:29.480000::And I want your life to be amazing.
0:39:29.480000 - 0:39:32.360000::And I'm so happy that you made it to this age
0:39:32.360000 - 0:39:35.040000::because I have love for people in this world.
0:39:35.040000 - 0:39:36.040000::I don't care who you are.
0:39:36.040000 - 0:39:37.200000::I don't care if you betrayed me.
0:39:37.200000 - 0:39:38.840000::I don't care if you've wronged me in the past.
0:39:38.840000 - 0:39:39.880000::I love you.
0:39:39.880000 - 0:39:42.360000::And that's the type of divide that I want to put out
0:39:42.360000 - 0:39:43.200000::in the world.
0:39:43.200000 - 0:39:44.440000::A lot of people want to kill you
0:39:44.440000 - 0:39:47.440000::and snap your, open your thick fucking mouth open,
0:39:47.440000 - 0:39:49.840000::like coconut, not me, not me.
0:39:49.840000 - 0:39:50.840000::Some people want to talk to you.
0:39:50.900000 - 0:39:53.520000::She's like falling asleep meth and out.
0:39:53.600000 - 0:39:57.280000::And I think she's like,
0:39:57.280000 - 0:39:58.360000::stop!

0:40:00 - 0:40:02::Oh
0:40:03.520000 - 0:40:05.520000::Yo, he's dead man, too

0:40:09.360000 - 0:40:11.360000::Bullets that don't quite kill you in the gun
0:40:11.360000 - 0:40:13.360000::So you can keep shooting you over and over again. Oh
0:40:14.400000 - 0:40:16.960000::So why the hell are we so twisted?
0:40:17.880000 - 0:40:19.880000::well
0:40:20.520000 - 0:40:26.120000::You know what why there's something I have recently that I can't remember but it's something about pain
0:40:26.120000 - 0:40:28.120000::Pain
0:40:30.800000 - 0:40:33.800000::Can't get enough pain
0:40:39.480000 - 0:40:43.320000::You know I listen that song when when when you got three days in the
0:40:44.200000 - 0:40:48.080000::11th grade when I did not go to homecoming

0:41:59.360000 - 0:42:02.520000::And it was kind of like a vague like why do they call him like wet jeans?
0:42:02.520000 - 0:42:04.520000::Mike or something like that and

0:46:23.240000 - 0:46:24.240000::Yeah, yeah, yeah.
0:46:24.240000 - 0:46:25.240000::That's right.
0:46:25.240000 - 0:46:26.240000::From different diseases.

0:46:27.240000 - 0:46:28.240000::You got to pick off on the couch that night didn't you?
0:46:28.240000 - 0:46:29.240000::I was, hell no.
0:46:29.240000 - 0:46:30.240000::I was, I was reading a book.
0:46:30.240000 - 0:46:34.040000::I was reading fucking Albert Albeir Camus on the couch.
0:46:34.040000 - 0:46:35.040000::The stranger.
0:46:35.040000 - 0:46:37.800000::Well, shout out to you, man.
0:46:37.800000 - 0:46:39.040000::Because that was a form of experience.
0:46:39.040000 - 0:46:41.480000::This is not, I was like, oh, but it's like good for you guys.
0:46:41.480000 - 0:46:42.480000::I'm serious.
0:46:42.480000 - 0:46:44.760000::And you're bringing it back to Eric.
0:46:44.760000 - 0:46:47.440000::So you are how old are you going to be?
0:46:47.440000 - 0:46:51.760000::Well, when this drops, you will be 31 31 years old.
0:46:51.760000 - 0:46:52.760000::So you are.
0:46:52.760000 - 0:46:54.360000::No, you're around the sun.
0:46:54.360000 - 0:46:57.920000::So how do you feel about getting older, Eric?
0:46:57.920000 - 0:46:58.920000::What does that mean to you?
0:46:58.920000 - 0:46:59.920000::What does it mean?
0:46:59.920000 - 0:47:02::Because for a lot of people, they dread getting older.
0:47:02 - 0:47:10.960000::They think that this is, my life is getting worse and the aging, my body is deteriorating.
0:47:10.960000 - 0:47:16.160000::See, a lot of people look at age as a machine, as a kind of enemy.
0:47:16.160000 - 0:47:17.160000::But how do you view age?
0:47:17.160000 - 0:47:22.600000::Dude, I view aging like this every fucking, like essentially what you do from running your
0:47:22.600000 - 0:47:29.720000::baby to when you die is you're digging your grave piece by piece, sand grain by sand grain.
0:47:29.720000 - 0:47:33.920000::Right now, I'm about 30, at least 30% of the weight into the fucking grave.
0:47:33.920000 - 0:47:35.880000::And so my view of the world is a little lower.
0:47:35.880000 - 0:47:37::It's a little different.
0:47:37 - 0:47:39.400000::I'm more grounded, you could say.
0:47:39.400000 - 0:47:40.400000::So more grounded?
0:47:40.400000 - 0:47:43.840000::Oh, as I get older, I'm about as grounded as you can get.
0:47:43.840000 - 0:47:44.840000::Nate, you disagree with that?
0:47:44.840000 - 0:47:45.840000::You know that?
0:47:45.840000 - 0:47:46.840000::I don't know.
0:47:46.840000 - 0:47:47.840000::I don't know where you are.
0:47:47.840000 - 0:47:49.160000::Would you guys call me grounded?
0:47:49.160000 - 0:47:50.160000::No.
0:47:50.160000 - 0:47:51.160000::Absolutely.
0:47:51.160000 - 0:47:52.160000::Absolutely.
0:47:53.160000 - 0:47:57.960000::That's interesting because all the bets that I volunteer with the fucking call me one
0:47:57.960000 - 0:48:00.760000::of the most grounded patient people that I've met.
0:48:00.760000 - 0:48:02.760000::You want to be at least grounded.
0:48:02.760000 - 0:48:07.560000::Most detached from reality people that I've ever met in my life.
0:48:07.560000 - 0:48:10.560000::Well, but that's fun.
0:48:10.560000 - 0:48:11.560000::You treat what?
0:48:11.560000 - 0:48:12.560000::Well, you mean it's like Pokemon cards.
0:48:12.560000 - 0:48:13.560000::I do, man.
0:48:13.560000 - 0:48:17.800000::I want to collect, I want to meet so many celebrities.
0:48:17.800000 - 0:48:18.960000::How do I feel about getting older?
0:48:18.960000 - 0:48:20.960000::You know, it feels kind of good.
0:48:20.960000 - 0:48:27.160000::I feel like we host a show called IDGA, IDGA Fology, IDGA Fology.
0:48:27.160000 - 0:48:28.360000::It means I don't give a fuckology.
0:48:28.360000 - 0:48:29.360000::ID Fology.
0:48:29.360000 - 0:48:32.960000::And I would say for real as I'm getting a little older, I never thought it would happen,
0:48:32.960000 - 0:48:35.360000::but I'm carrying a little bit less.
0:48:35.360000 - 0:48:36.360000::Yep.
0:48:36.360000 - 0:48:38.960000::I'm carrying a little bit less what people think.
0:48:38.960000 - 0:48:41.160000::The people pleasing is getting turned down.
0:48:41.160000 - 0:48:43.160000::Not that much, but maybe one notch.
0:48:43.160000 - 0:48:44.160000::Err, what?
0:48:44.160000 - 0:48:48.760000::Can I tell you, can I say, I invite you to think about that differently.
0:48:48.760000 - 0:48:49.760000::This is please.
0:48:49.760000 - 0:48:51.560000::Are you carrying less?
0:48:51.560000 - 0:48:53.160000::Are you carrying more appropriately?
0:48:53.160000 - 0:49:00.160000::I mean, not less, but are you shifting what you care about so that your care ever is
0:49:00.160000 - 0:49:02.160000::now in the correct things?
0:49:02.160000 - 0:49:04.160000::Let me respond to this like Matthew McConaughey on Lex Friedman.
0:49:04.160000 - 0:49:05.160000::He goes like this.
0:49:05.160000 - 0:49:06.960000::Oh, shit.
0:49:06.960000 - 0:49:09.960000::That's interesting.
0:49:09.960000 - 0:49:12.960000::What's in his mouth?
0:49:12.960000 - 0:49:13.960000::Well, his tongue is in his mouth.
0:49:13.960000 - 0:49:15.960000::That's kind of feeling his teeth as he thinks.
0:49:15.960000 - 0:49:16.960000::He's got that.
0:49:16.960000 - 0:49:17.960000::Texas Draws in his mouth.
0:49:17.960000 - 0:49:18.960000::That's very interesting.
0:49:19.360000 - 0:49:23.360000::You know, my father, no, I don't know where I'm going with that.
0:49:23.360000 - 0:49:24.360000::I'm just saying.
0:49:24.360000 - 0:49:25.360000::Matthew McConaughey.
0:49:25.360000 - 0:49:29.360000::He's like, he's all slow that he has.
0:49:29.360000 - 0:49:31.760000::I'm a kind of a Matthew McConaughey freak.
0:49:31.760000 - 0:49:32.760000::I like his ass.
0:49:32.760000 - 0:49:33.760000::Well, he's a trumpet thunder.
0:49:33.760000 - 0:49:34.760000::He's in trouble.
0:49:34.760000 - 0:49:35.760000::He's an all sorts of.
0:49:35.760000 - 0:49:36.760000::He throws a hell.
0:49:36.760000 - 0:49:37.760000::He throws a briefcase.
0:49:37.760000 - 0:49:38.760000::True detective.
0:49:38.760000 - 0:49:42.760000::Oh, what about Texas Dallas Buyers Club?
0:49:42.760000 - 0:49:43.760000::That's one of them.
0:49:43.760000 - 0:49:44.760000::What about the letter?
0:49:44.760000 - 0:49:45.760000::Jared let oh, dude.
0:49:45.760000 - 0:49:47.560000::We don't believe all lies about you.
0:49:47.560000 - 0:49:48.760000::Come on the podcast.
0:49:48.760000 - 0:49:52.360000::Jared let oh, dude.
0:49:52.360000 - 0:49:54.760000::30 seconds to Mars is the second fucking man.
0:49:54.760000 - 0:49:56.960000::More like 30 seconds to freaking.
0:49:56.960000 - 0:49:59.160000::I mean, heaven, yeah, sexual heaven.
0:49:59.160000 - 0:49:59.960000::Mars, we're like.

0:50:00 - 0:50:04.380000::30, 30, 30, you know, that's beautiful man under 30.
0:50:04.380000 - 0:50:05.720000::He's so gorgeous.
0:50:05.720000 - 0:50:07.120000::He is, looks, you know what?
0:50:07.120000 - 0:50:07.960000::Jared Leto.
0:50:07.960000 - 0:50:10.480000::You did a little quiz and you put the four of us
0:50:10.480000 - 0:50:12.080000::next to each other.
0:50:12.080000 - 0:50:15.960000::Nobody on the planet would guess that he is 30 years older than us.
0:50:15.960000 - 0:50:18.760000::I will say this though, the rot is a beginning to show.
0:50:18.760000 - 0:50:22.840000::If you have a rot in core, the rot shows up at a certain point.
0:50:22.840000 - 0:50:23.680000::That's right.
0:50:23.680000 - 0:50:24.680000::It shows up in your eyes.
0:50:24.680000 - 0:50:27.520000::And that's what's happening is I can tell people's character
0:50:27.520000 - 0:50:28.200000::like this.
0:50:28.200000 - 0:50:29.040000::Eric Leto.
0:50:29.040000 - 0:50:30.040000::Jason.
0:50:30.040000 - 0:50:31.040000::Jason.
0:50:31.040000 - 0:50:32.040000::Amazing.
0:50:32.040000 - 0:50:35.960000::But you come into my periphery.
0:50:35.960000 - 0:50:39.520000::I'm telling what type of character you have just by a look.
0:50:39.520000 - 0:50:40.520000::Really?
0:50:40.520000 - 0:50:41.520000::Yeah, literally.
0:50:41.520000 - 0:50:43.840000::I'm a crazy judge of character.
0:50:43.840000 - 0:50:46.640000::And I will be nice to everybody.
0:50:46.640000 - 0:50:53.040000::Would you be nice to somebody who had, I don't know if it's a birth
0:50:53.040000 - 0:50:54.800000::effect or cosmetic surgery?
0:50:54.800000 - 0:50:55.800000::Yes, yes.
0:50:55.800000 - 0:50:59.880000::I think that they have a belly button that is the perfect size of a shot glass.
0:50:59.880000 - 0:51:00.880000::And so people can rip shots.
0:51:00.880000 - 0:51:01.880000::Oh, dude.

0:52:10.280000 - 0:52:12.280000::Or do some birthday memories.
0:52:12.280000 - 0:52:17.800000::One of my birthdays, I stayed up with my friends at a sleepover and they all went to
0:52:17.800000 - 0:52:18.800000::the bathroom.
0:52:18.800000 - 0:52:20.920000::I was constipated and I saw it in there for a long time.
0:52:20.920000 - 0:52:22.520000::I was about nine years old.
0:52:22.520000 - 0:52:29.040000::I came out and all my friends fucking betrayed me by pretending to be fucking dead.
0:52:29.040000 - 0:52:32::And I tried to wake their asses up and they weren't laughing.
0:52:32 - 0:52:34.080000::And so I started fucking sobbing.
0:52:34.080000 - 0:52:35.480000::Shaking my best friends.
0:52:35.480000 - 0:52:36.480000::Wake up, bald.
0:52:36.480000 - 0:52:37.480000::Wake up.
0:52:37.480000 - 0:52:38.480000::I'm not kidding you guys.
0:52:38.480000 - 0:52:42.440000::I went to get my mom told her all my friends had died there and then my mom gets
0:52:42.440000 - 0:52:44.560000::down there like, what's up Mrs. Raheel?
0:52:44.560000 - 0:52:47.440000::I'm like, that's why I don't deal with betrayal.
0:52:47.440000 - 0:52:48.440000::You know what I'm saying?
0:52:48.440000 - 0:52:50.520000::I don't deal with magic tricks.
0:52:50.520000 - 0:52:52.120000::Because I've been fucking tricking my whole life.
0:52:52.120000 - 0:52:53.640000::You've never wronged you in your life.
0:52:53.640000 - 0:52:54.640000::You have so many scars.
0:52:54.640000 - 0:52:55.640000::I had a little black go.
0:52:55.640000 - 0:52:56.640000::I do trust people.
0:52:56.640000 - 0:53:01.040000::I threw my little black book into the fire, but I have a little red book with them fucking
0:53:01.040000 - 0:53:02.040000::worst ones.
0:53:02.040000 - 0:53:04.040000::And you have the worst handwriting.
0:53:04.040000 - 0:53:07.280000::It's like, by the way, Eric J. Ricks like this.
0:53:07.280000 - 0:53:09.040000::He writes free hands all of his jokes.
0:53:09.040000 - 0:53:12.720000::And he has this really, really large notebook.
0:53:12.720000 - 0:53:17.760000::And he holds his, he has crayons and he writes his jokes so slowly.
0:53:17.760000 - 0:53:19.120000::You can barely read them.
0:53:19.120000 - 0:53:20.120000::I'm just my fist.
0:53:20.120000 - 0:53:22.240000::He has his hand kind of crumbles.
0:53:22.240000 - 0:53:23.880000::His hands are all covered in chito oil.
0:53:23.880000 - 0:53:24.880000::Yeah.
0:53:24.880000 - 0:53:27.480000::But that's just that everybody has a different product.
0:53:27.480000 - 0:53:28.480000::No, everybody's different.
0:53:28.480000 - 0:53:29.480000::Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
0:53:29.480000 - 0:53:30.480000::And that's yours.
0:53:30.480000 - 0:53:31.480000::And I don't judge you.
0:53:31.480000 - 0:53:35.800000::I think that whatever works for you, even though it is fucked up and you know, whatever
0:53:35.800000 - 0:53:39.120000::we just got to keep this machine going.
0:53:39.120000 - 0:53:43.680000::Another birthday memory is when I was turned 16, I had almost no friends.
0:53:43.680000 - 0:53:48.880000::And maybe I turned, yeah, I was 16 because I drove myself to the blockbuster.
0:53:48.880000 - 0:53:52::And the whole summer I wasn't hanging out with anybody.
0:53:52 - 0:53:53::Sorry.
0:53:53 - 0:53:54::I wasn't hanging out with anybody.
0:53:54 - 0:53:59.800000::So I would take the camera, toy to camera, to the grocery store.
0:53:59.800000 - 0:54:04::I would get the little two pound pack of twizzlers or one pound pack, you know, that big fat
0:54:04 - 0:54:06.480000::pack of twizzlers, the regular kind.
0:54:06.480000 - 0:54:08.760000::I'd go to blockbuster, I'd get two movies.
0:54:08.760000 - 0:54:12.560000::And on my 16th birthday, I watched Titanic for the first time and ate the whole fucking
0:54:12.560000 - 0:54:13.720000::thing in twizzlers.
0:54:13.720000 - 0:54:15.200000::And I was so fucking sad.
0:54:15.200000 - 0:54:17::What was the other movie?
0:54:17.160000 - 0:54:20.160000::Oh, I think literally the other movie was sideways.

0:54:29.840000 - 0:54:32.160000::And did you turn 16, huh?
0:54:32.160000 - 0:54:36.360000::So you had a, no, I must have turned, I've had less than been turning 17 because I drove

1:00:14.500000 - 1:00:17.180000::got out of the fucking way, stopped biking if there's no shoulder.
1:00:17.180000 - 1:00:21.040000::Do not bike on a road like that. It's danger in you and everybody around you.
1:00:21.040000 - 1:00:25.180000::That's making everyone late. So that's been giving me joy.
1:00:25.180000 - 1:00:30.580000::Something simple that everybody could do. Just feel in the pedal, feel in the steering wheel.
1:00:30.580000 - 1:00:35.020000::Let us know what gave you joy if you're a female. Let us know where you are.
