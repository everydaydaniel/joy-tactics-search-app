0:02:18.080000 - 0:02:20.280000::You wanna, but we're talking about stuff
0:02:20.280000 - 0:02:21.400000::that I can't mention right now.
0:02:21.400000 - 0:02:24.680000::Words using words that are really silly
0:02:24.680000 - 0:02:26.400000::that you shouldn't use in.
0:02:26.400000 - 0:02:27.400000::Band-by-go.
0:02:27.400000 - 0:02:29.320000::We won't go into those topics right now.

0:02:30.400000 - 0:02:31.920000::Because today, it's about the children.
0:02:31.920000 - 0:02:32.920000::It's about the children.
0:02:32.920000 - 0:02:34.120000::It's about cranes.

0:02:36.440000 - 0:02:39::By the kids, the inner kids.
0:02:39 - 0:02:42.680000::And we're just gonna have a good time trying to keep it clean.
0:02:42.680000 - 0:02:47.160000::And I feel like we can connect so hard with what children
0:02:47.160000 - 0:02:49.840000::are into because we have retained.
0:02:49.840000 - 0:02:53.600000::A lot of people have casted away their inner child
0:02:53.600000 - 0:02:55.560000::as they've grown up and become an adult.
0:02:55.560000 - 0:03:00.160000::And us, I feel like we have definitely retained
0:03:00.160000 - 0:03:02.040000::that inner sense of play within.
0:03:02.040000 - 0:03:02.880000::Oh yeah.
0:03:02.880000 - 0:03:05.080000::That inner sense of imagination and creativity
0:03:05.080000 - 0:03:08.760000::and boundless sort of whatever.
0:03:08.760000 - 0:03:09.600000::I'm trailing off.
0:03:09.600000 - 0:03:10.600000::I'm not finishing the sentence.
0:03:10.600000 - 0:03:12.200000::Let's get it back to the kids.
0:03:12.200000 - 0:03:13.120000::We're talking to the adults.
0:03:13.120000 - 0:03:13.960000::Right.
0:03:13.960000 - 0:03:18::So let's get all the kids to make a promise to us right now
0:03:18 - 0:03:21.600000::that you will never grow up just like us.
0:03:21.600000 - 0:03:24::One, two, three.
0:03:24 - 0:03:25.040000::Nice.
0:03:25.040000 - 0:03:28.200000::Now turn around three times, right?
0:03:28.200000 - 0:03:30.440000::And do a jumping jack.
0:03:30.440000 - 0:03:31.600000::Nice.
0:03:31.600000 - 0:03:32.280000::All right.
0:03:32.280000 - 0:03:34.480000::Hey kids, if you're listening to this,
0:03:34.480000 - 0:03:35.840000::what's your favorite type of food?
0:03:35.840000 - 0:03:38.360000::Shatter it out right now and we'll do the same.
0:03:38.360000 - 0:03:40.560000::Eric Burrito, Jack.
0:03:40.560000 - 0:03:45.480000::Burrito, I was gonna say chicken wing actually.
0:03:45.480000 - 0:03:48.480000::Nate, plain rice, no seasoning.
0:03:48.480000 - 0:03:49.400000::Nothing else.
0:03:49.400000 - 0:03:50.800000::Just the rice.
0:03:50.800000 - 0:03:52.080000::Nothing else in it.
0:03:52.080000 - 0:03:53.360000::Just plain rice.
0:03:53.360000 - 0:03:56.760000::Man, you were, you were telling us at dinner
0:03:56.760000 - 0:03:58.640000::what you kind of do with rice sometimes.
0:03:58.640000 - 0:04:01.400000::Sometimes I put butter up in it.
0:04:01.400000 - 0:04:02.480000::Are you kidding me?
0:04:02.480000 - 0:04:06.880000::Like that as a kind of immigrant sort of,
0:04:06.880000 - 0:04:09.280000::that's what I grew up eating a lot of times.
0:04:09.280000 - 0:04:10.440000::It was rice and butter.
0:04:10.440000 - 0:04:15.360000::Can you spell rice and butter and Ohio
0:04:15.360000 - 0:04:18.480000::and father working at a church?
0:04:19.320000 - 0:04:21.400000::Can we check in with the children a bit?
0:04:21.400000 - 0:04:22.880000::Because a lot of these TV shows
0:04:22.880000 - 0:04:25.320000::and a lot of these programs and YouTube,
0:04:25.320000 - 0:04:30.320000::they are making children spell things and name things.
0:04:31.200000 - 0:04:32.400000::Is that what you want?
0:04:32.400000 - 0:04:34.480000::I don't think, is that what the children really want?
0:04:34.480000 - 0:04:35.320000::Do they want to be like?
0:04:35.320000 - 0:04:36.160000::I don't heck no.
0:04:36.160000 - 0:04:38.760000::You guys want to hear about the worst day of my life?
0:04:38.760000 - 0:04:39.600000::Yep.
0:04:39.600000 - 0:04:43.040000::Somebody who happened to be my teacher in first grade said,
0:04:43.040000 - 0:04:47.880000::Jack, can you spell Grasshopper for everybody?
0:04:47.880000 - 0:04:48.720000::No.
0:04:48.720000 - 0:04:49.320000::And I went,
0:04:49.320000 - 0:04:52.360000::G-R-U-P-P-E-R.
0:04:52.360000 - 0:04:54.120000::And guess what happened?
0:04:54.120000 - 0:04:55.880000::I'm not gonna say what happened.
0:04:55.880000 - 0:04:58.400000::But basically somebody with blonde hair jumped up on the desk
0:04:58.400000 - 0:05:01.040000::and took his penis out and had to go to the principal.

0:05:00 - 0:05:02.700000::We're believing that, we're believing that word.
0:05:02.700000 - 0:05:04.540000::Penis is medical, they need to know that one.
0:05:04.540000 - 0:05:05.540000::That is medical.
0:05:05.540000 - 0:05:07.340000::If you're gonna refer to that type of shit,
0:05:07.340000 - 0:05:08.980000::just use that full medical term.
0:05:08.980000 - 0:05:10.300000::Don't use any of the other words,
0:05:10.300000 - 0:05:11.140000::anybody's throwing around,
0:05:11.140000 - 0:05:12.980000::because that's disgusting, that's filth.
0:05:12.980000 - 0:05:16.100000::As a child, you should not be encountering filth.
0:05:16.100000 - 0:05:18.700000::You should not be participating in filth.
0:05:18.700000 - 0:05:21.820000::You must be clean for the Lord.
0:05:21.820000 - 0:05:24.660000::Unless the filth is dirt in your fingernails,
0:05:24.660000 - 0:05:27.060000::because you were eating worms and onion grass.
0:05:27.060000 - 0:05:29.220000::Hey kids, I got a challenge for you.
0:05:29.220000 - 0:05:32.740000::This goes hand in hand with my vision to save the world.
0:05:32.740000 - 0:05:36.180000::If you got mommy or daddy's iPad, go take that out back
0:05:36.180000 - 0:05:38.060000::and see what a rock does to it.
0:05:38.060000 - 0:05:40.340000::Smash that thing.
0:05:40.340000 - 0:05:43.940000::You sound like one of my influences, Marshall matters.
0:05:45.940000 - 0:05:47.740000::There's a fucking, sorry.
0:05:47.740000 - 0:05:50.220000::I said the F word, my bad.
0:05:50.220000 - 0:05:51.100000::Oh, that's fine.
0:05:51.100000 - 0:05:51.940000::Well, that's fine.
0:05:51.940000 - 0:05:52.940000::Okay, if you're gonna,
0:05:52.940000 - 0:05:57.140000::oh yeah, it's a black carpenter, Anne.
0:05:57.140000 - 0:05:58.580000::Oh yeah, it's an Anne.
0:05:58.580000 - 0:06:00.580000::It's like, you're innovating the property we're at right now.
0:06:00.580000 - 0:06:01.860000::It scares us.
0:06:01.860000 - 0:06:03.460000::We need to bring up something right now,
0:06:03.460000 - 0:06:06.820000::because something just happened where we just got off track
0:06:06.820000 - 0:06:10.140000::and there was a curse word that was thrown out.
0:06:10.140000 - 0:06:14.620000::But I think it's important to know that some children
0:06:14.620000 - 0:06:16.940000::need to hear some of, you know,
0:06:16.940000 - 0:06:19.060000::that grown-ups can make mistakes.
0:06:19.060000 - 0:06:20.900000::That's okay to make a mistake, right?
0:06:20.900000 - 0:06:23.900000::Kids can make mistakes too, grown-ups make mistakes.
0:06:23.900000 - 0:06:28.060000::But what do we say on joy tactics for kids?
0:06:28.060000 - 0:06:29.580000::Oh yeah, that's okay.
0:06:29.580000 - 0:06:32.380000::And we say this, Ace, can you spell a set up
0:06:32.380000 - 0:06:35.220000::as a setback for a setback as a set up for a comeback?
0:06:35.220000 - 0:06:38.220000::Because sometimes you'd be saying something you shouldn't have said
0:06:38.220000 - 0:06:40.500000::and it makes everybody upset.
0:06:40.500000 - 0:06:42.140000::And guess what you do?
0:06:42.140000 - 0:06:43.300000::You don't apologize.
0:06:43.300000 - 0:06:45.420000::You say I'm growing now.
0:06:45.420000 - 0:06:47.060000::Well, and guess what everybody?
0:06:47.060000 - 0:06:49.380000::We got a kitty, a cat.
0:06:49.380000 - 0:06:50.420000::And we got our labs.
0:06:50.420000 - 0:06:51.620000::This is Muffy everybody.
0:06:51.620000 - 0:06:53.100000::Can you say hello to Muffy?
0:06:53.100000 - 0:06:54.100000::Hello Muffy.
0:06:54.100000 - 0:06:57.380000::My cat has been bothering the shit out of me all morning.
0:06:57.380000 - 0:07:01.620000::Okay, so that is a lower tier of offense.
0:07:01.620000 - 0:07:04.220000::But, no, it's not even about, honestly, in my house,
0:07:04.220000 - 0:07:05.700000::cursing is fine.
0:07:05.700000 - 0:07:07.620000::So it's not about cursing, it's about action.
0:07:07.620000 - 0:07:10.380000::Because would you rather have somebody say a curse word to you
0:07:10.380000 - 0:07:12.220000::or wake up on Christmas morning
0:07:12.220000 - 0:07:15.340000::and every one of your parents' throats have been slit?
0:07:15.340000 - 0:07:16.180000::Right.
0:07:16.180000 - 0:07:17.340000::And...
0:07:17.340000 - 0:07:18.660000::Oh, yeah.
0:07:18.660000 - 0:07:20.060000::You're calling.
0:07:20.060000 - 0:07:22.300000::You guys know what doctors are, right?
0:07:22.300000 - 0:07:23.460000::They're good for you.
0:07:23.460000 - 0:07:25.300000::They're good for you and you should trust them.
0:07:25.300000 - 0:07:27.180000::I want to say this about making mistakes.
0:07:27.180000 - 0:07:29.620000::Because when I was the kid, I was so convinced
0:07:29.620000 - 0:07:34.020000::that any time I made a mistake, I would be cursed.
0:07:34.020000 - 0:07:34.860000::This is the end.
0:07:34.860000 - 0:07:36.780000::I can't make one mistake and it's over.
0:07:36.780000 - 0:07:38.300000::The truth of the matter is...
0:07:38.300000 - 0:07:39.300000::Oh, yeah.
0:07:39.300000 - 0:07:41.420000::You get a certain amount of numbers of mistakes in life.
0:07:41.420000 - 0:07:43.380000::Serious mistakes you can make.
0:07:43.380000 - 0:07:44.380000::If you...
0:07:44.380000 - 0:07:47.980000::There is a limit of forgiveness within society.
0:07:47.980000 - 0:07:49.620000::If you cross one of these boundaries,
0:07:49.620000 - 0:07:52.180000::even as a child, if you do something horrible enough,
0:07:52.180000 - 0:07:53.940000::you will be tossed out by society.
0:07:53.940000 - 0:07:56.380000::But you get a certain amount of freebies.
0:07:56.380000 - 0:07:58.620000::So, yeah, you could steal a couple dollars.
0:07:58.620000 - 0:08:00.140000::You could go accidentally knock some paint over
0:08:00.140000 - 0:08:00.980000::on someone's house.
0:08:00.980000 - 0:08:03.620000::You could do a couple things and people will still rock with you.
0:08:03.620000 - 0:08:06.020000::But if you cross the line, society,
0:08:06.020000 - 0:08:07.780000::we haven't progressed that much.
0:08:07.780000 - 0:08:10.180000::They're forgiveness is kind of a foreign concept
0:08:10.180000 - 0:08:11.540000::to a lot of people in the society.
0:08:11.540000 - 0:08:13.500000::If you cross the line, you will be thrown out
0:08:13.500000 - 0:08:15.300000::like garbage into a fire.
0:08:15.300000 - 0:08:16.460000::And we'll forget about you.
0:08:16.460000 - 0:08:17.460000::You're all right.
0:08:17.460000 - 0:08:18.460000::Nobody's gonna...
0:08:18.460000 - 0:08:20.260000::We'll never forget about you.
0:08:20.260000 - 0:08:21.740000::Eric did something recently this week
0:08:21.740000 - 0:08:24.340000::that's gonna come out in the press.
0:08:24.340000 - 0:08:25.340000::We've been...
0:08:25.420000 - 0:08:28.100000::We've been notified by Eric's reps.
0:08:28.100000 - 0:08:30.660000::And they were notified by Variety Magazine
0:08:30.660000 - 0:08:33.260000::and by the New York Mag and by Washington Post.
0:08:33.260000 - 0:08:36.140000::Let's just say it was an attempt to unify two,
0:08:36.140000 - 0:08:39.660000::basically what they call fighting neighbors, Palestine and Israel.
0:08:39.660000 - 0:08:43.460000::It was a visual stunt, an artistic stunt that went sour.
0:08:43.460000 - 0:08:46.020000::And sometimes you can't control people's reactions
0:08:46.020000 - 0:08:46.860000::to the things.
0:08:46.860000 - 0:08:47.700000::No, you can't.
0:08:47.700000 - 0:08:50.060000::And unfortunately, this is gonna end with me losing a lot of business,
0:08:50.060000 - 0:08:51.460000::losing a lot of maybe friends.
0:08:51.460000 - 0:08:52.900000::But let's make a pact right now.
0:08:52.900000 - 0:08:55.300000::And kids, this is an important lesson for you.
0:08:55.460000 - 0:08:57.660000::If one of your friends does something really bad
0:08:57.660000 - 0:09:00.660000::to the point where it is ruining your relationships
0:09:00.660000 - 0:09:04.340000::to even know them, pick a side.
0:09:04.340000 - 0:09:05.340000::Pick a side.
0:09:05.340000 - 0:09:06.100000::Pick a side.
0:09:06.100000 - 0:09:10.020000::And I encourage you to pick the side with the most money.
0:09:10.020000 - 0:09:11.020000::Yep.
0:09:11.020000 - 0:09:12.260000::Oh, yeah.
0:09:12.260000 - 0:09:14.020000::So we sing a song about something now?
0:09:14.020000 - 0:09:15.020000::Yeah, yeah, yeah.
0:09:16.100000 - 0:09:19.980000::Because kids, there's something called cancel culture.
0:09:19.980000 - 0:09:22.420000::And it's fucking ruining the whole world.
0:09:22.420000 - 0:09:24.260000::You look at people who are being canceled.
0:09:24.260000 - 0:09:25.100000::Do you see any of those Stevie Wonder?
0:09:25.100000 - 0:09:25.940000::Is he alive?
0:09:25.940000 - 0:09:26.940000::Oh, yeah.
0:09:26.940000 - 0:09:28.180000::Oh, yeah.
0:09:28.180000 - 0:09:29.020000::God.
0:09:29.020000 - 0:09:29.860000::And you know what kids?
0:09:29.860000 - 0:09:32.260000::I wanna tell you, because if you hear me grunting and pain,
0:09:32.260000 - 0:09:35.060000::something not that chill happened to me yesterday.
0:09:35.060000 - 0:09:38.340000::I was, here's the other thing, another lesson.
0:09:38.340000 - 0:09:40.540000::Your bodies can fail you.
0:09:40.540000 - 0:09:44.180000::And what happened to me yesterday is I think probably did a great
0:09:44.180000 - 0:09:47.140000::to tear on my hamstring by trying to sprint.
0:09:47.140000 - 0:09:50.580000::And to be, I participated in ego
0:09:50.580000 - 0:09:53.300000::and trying to show everybody how fast I was on camera.
0:09:53.300000 - 0:09:55.100000::You tried to keep up with a young buck.

0:10:56.980000 - 0:11:04.580000::It's similar to when a tsunami hits sometimes you hear people talk about the tsunami and they they say it's shocking how silent it was
0:11:05.780000 - 0:11:09.220000::I remember when in 2004 when that tsunami hit and
0:11:10.300000 - 0:11:12.660000::People were talking about how you know
0:11:13.060000 - 0:11:17.340000::Tours were running out to the beach because I saw big waves and the tide had been sucked out
0:11:17.340000 - 0:11:19.500000::Yeah, people were screaming out of them don't go
0:11:20.140000 - 0:11:25.200000::Out there don't go do it and those people that went to play in the in the

0:11:46.780000 - 0:11:50.740000::You know when you imagine this you know look outside right now
0:11:50.740000 - 0:11:54.620000::You see all the leaves on the trees you see all the grass on the ground
0:11:55.340000 - 0:12:00.900000::Imagine of every single one of those were people and now imagine if they were gone for ever
0:12:00.900000 - 0:12:06.500000::I think this is something that a lot of kids out there need to understand is that
0:12:06.820000 - 0:12:14.860000::This the world that you were born into is one of the most chaotic most violent most destructive worlds that maybe you could have
0:12:14.860000 - 0:12:21.860000::Ever been born into yeah, the era of anytime. So I just want to say first off good luck and second off that
0:12:22.420000 - 0:12:24.900000::You need to watch your fucking back because
0:12:25.780000 - 0:12:31.140000::Everything could be good watch your back one day, but the next day there could be a tornado

0:12:34.500000 - 0:12:36.220000::I don't want to put still that fear in you
0:12:36.220000 - 0:12:41.540000::I just want to prepare you for what the truth is because a lot of people have been lying to you in your life
0:12:41.540000 - 0:12:46.900000::You have been lied to by the media by the television by all these things that are in your life and you need a fucking
0:12:46.900000 - 0:12:54.900000::Roo sorry a fricking wake up call right now. That was a pretty weak apology right there and when you slip an apology into
0:12:56.180000 - 0:13:01.540000::The rant it just gonna happen. It's just gonna happen. Let me continue this this train of thought real quick
0:13:01.820000 - 0:13:07.420000::There is such a thing as spiritual and car make debt and people think that this is a individual debt
0:13:07.420000 - 0:13:10.960000::This is a societal debt. This is a species wide debt
0:13:10.960000 - 0:13:14.180000::What we are doing right now is paying for the crimes of
0:13:15.020000 - 0:13:21.020000::Our ancestors that really thought that they could rule the world that they could use oil forever in the 40s and 50s
0:13:21.020000 - 0:13:24.900000::American industrial capitalism and the military industrial complex
0:13:24.900000 - 0:13:29.900000::What we're just seeing now is the an inkling of the consequences of the sins of our father
0:13:29.900000 - 0:13:36.460000::Why do they call it you guys are gonna have to deal with you guys are the generation that humanity is gonna hinge on we can't come up with the solutions
0:13:36.460000 - 0:13:39.580000::Maybe it's gonna be a I we don't know where AI is going
0:13:39.740000 - 0:13:43.420000::But you guys are gonna be the real ones that decide the future of humanity
0:13:43.420000 - 0:13:49.980000::Are we going towards heaven the nice fun stuff with playgrounds and water parks or are we going to
0:13:50.500000 - 0:13:55.140000::Nese grape hell where you get cuts and boo booze like you can't imagine forever
0:13:55.900000 - 0:14:03.900000::It depends on your guys's generation. So act right get it together because we're counting on you guys to keep this stuff going to keep

0:14:12.220000 - 0:14:14.460000::Always say thank you when you're done speaking. Thank you
0:14:15.420000 - 0:14:17.900000::Man, I am just give it up for Eric
0:14:18.660000 - 0:14:20.660000::You impress me with how
0:14:21.780000 - 0:14:26.060000::How well you speak and how long you can give a give a conversation?
0:14:26.220000 - 0:14:30.020000::That makes sense like I truly you probably just spoke for
0:14:30.660000 - 0:14:33.580000::40 seconds that was about no that was a minute. I
0:14:34.460000 - 0:14:40.900000::Here's not easy. It's you don't think it's easy, but what's going on is I'm having normal conversations in your head all the time and so kids
0:14:40.900000 - 0:14:42.420000::You might be talking about video games, right?
0:14:42.420000 - 0:14:45.740000::But you're thinking about what or you or you or your type of Oreo you want to eat later
0:14:45.740000 - 0:14:50.220000::I think about that's how I deal with almost everything. I'm talking about you to you guys about some stuff
0:14:50.220000 - 0:14:56.300000::I some fun things, but you're doing so I'm going off on crazy essays that I'm writing in my head right
0:14:56.300000 - 0:14:59.980000::That's impressive dude because I you know

0:15:00 - 0:15:04.320000::know, when I try to talk, I feel like a sentence gets going even like right now.
0:15:04.320000 - 0:15:08.200000::I'm imagining what's going on around that tree that I'm looking at.
0:15:08.200000 - 0:15:09.280000::And now I want to talk about that.
0:15:09.600000 - 0:15:12.200000::That's the problem with whatever disease I have.
0:15:12.200000 - 0:15:14.760000::And kids, let know this.
0:15:15 - 0:15:18.960000::If you're in school and you're seeing other people excelling, excelling,
0:15:18.960000 - 0:15:22.560000::and they're getting in better grades, they're all getting A's and you're getting
0:15:22.560000 - 0:15:24.400000::used for unsatisfactory.
0:15:26.400000 - 0:15:26.880000::You.
0:15:27.600000 - 0:15:28.560000::It's the lowest.
0:15:28.560000 - 0:15:33.480000::It was the lowest they would let us get in elementary school before you get sucked
0:15:33.480000 - 0:15:37.360000::into the rip tide of special needs classes for the rest of your bad thing.
0:15:37.400000 - 0:15:42.440000::Which by the way, by the way, when you put a kid like me in the special needs
0:15:42.440000 - 0:15:44.560000::classes, you think you're helping us.
0:15:44.640000 - 0:15:48.200000::But what you're really doing is you're denying us the information that the rest of
0:15:48.200000 - 0:15:49.080000::the kids are learning.
0:15:49.360000 - 0:15:53.520000::And I'm realizing this right now that as soon as you take your first special
0:15:53.520000 - 0:15:57.600000::needs class, you have officially missed out on whatever everybody else just learned.
0:15:57.600000 - 0:16:01.960000::And you are now trapped in these cyclos, special needery and you will grow up
0:16:01.960000 - 0:16:04.880000::the rest of your life being denied information that everybody else read.
0:16:04.960000 - 0:16:05.720000::What's the great gaps?
0:16:05.720000 - 0:16:07.680000::Be about people drinking lemonade.
0:16:07.880000 - 0:16:08.920000::What's not far off?
0:16:08.920000 - 0:16:12.280000::My son meant about I literally you want me to try to guess what of my
0:16:12.280000 - 0:16:13.280000::some men is about right now.
0:16:13.480000 - 0:16:13.840000::Yeah.
0:16:14.040000 - 0:16:17.400000::It's about two warring cities where one person is fucking wrong.
0:16:17.440000 - 0:16:17.880000::All right.
0:16:17.960000 - 0:16:20.080000::No, it's about well, I tried.
0:16:20.120000 - 0:16:21.480000::And I'll add to this kids.
0:16:21.480000 - 0:16:26.080000::If you see a kid in your class that's crazily smart, I remember in the first grade,
0:16:26.080000 - 0:16:28.360000::there was a kid named Willie who was so good at math.
0:16:28.360000 - 0:16:31.880000::They had sat him in the back to do other worksheets because he could do our works,
0:16:31.880000 - 0:16:34::our math worksheets in about five minutes.
0:16:34 - 0:16:36.080000::Willie will guess what happened to Willie?
0:16:36.720000 - 0:16:41.320000::He basically, he couldn't hit it socially.
0:16:41.320000 - 0:16:42::His first though.
0:16:42 - 0:16:46.280000::He was, I mean, he might have been smart and math, but he was not well liked by the
0:16:46.280000 - 0:16:47::other kids.
0:16:47 - 0:16:47.280000::Correct.
0:16:47.280000 - 0:16:49.400000::So you see someone that smart, well, guess what?
0:16:49.400000 - 0:16:51.720000::They have their own fault and their own failings.
0:16:51.960000 - 0:16:53.440000::So get some perspective.
0:16:53.440000 - 0:16:56.280000::If you might not be able to do multiplication, but you can probably
0:16:56.560000 - 0:17:00.120000::dab it up with the other kids and being normal kid and eat popsicles.
0:17:00.520000 - 0:17:04.400000::So well, let me introduce you to a thing called, you may have never heard this word
0:17:04.400000 - 0:17:04.920000::before.
0:17:05.400000 - 0:17:10.400000::Balance B-A-L-A-N-C-E balance.
0:17:11.040000 - 0:17:11.840000::Balance.
0:17:12.160000 - 0:17:16.760000::Balance is something that you need to incorporate in your life right now because
0:17:16.760000 - 0:17:20.400000::things can get out of hand if you put your eggs in all in one basket.
0:17:20.560000 - 0:17:25.280000::If you try to be the baseball kid and you're the baseball kid, well, guess what?
0:17:25.360000 - 0:17:27.400000::You didn't learn how to read as well.
0:17:27.400000 - 0:17:31.880000::You didn't learn how to share your toys and such with other kids.
0:17:32.120000 - 0:17:35.280000::It's about being equally good at every single thing.
0:17:35.280000 - 0:17:37.560000::Don't excel in one thing, excel in everything.
0:17:37.560000 - 0:17:39::Be the Renaissance child.
0:17:39.360000 - 0:17:39.760000::Okay.
0:17:39.760000 - 0:17:40.480000::And that's that.
0:17:40.480000 - 0:17:44.200000::I feel like a lot of children don't have this, this balance because you're
0:17:44.200000 - 0:17:46.360000::probably eating too much sugar, too much cereal.
0:17:46.480000 - 0:17:46.840000::Yeah.
0:17:47.320000 - 0:17:49.320000::And maybe you need a little bit more vegetables.
0:17:49.320000 - 0:17:51.080000::Maybe you need a little bit more protein.
0:17:51.840000 - 0:17:55.360000::Don't listen to anybody, except for us, except for us because we're being
0:17:55.360000 - 0:17:55.880000::honest.
0:17:55.880000 - 0:17:57.040000::We have no reason to lie to you.
0:17:57.120000 - 0:17:57.400000::Right.
0:17:57.400000 - 0:17:58.240000::We have no investment.
0:17:58.240000 - 0:18:00.440000::We don't give a rat's whatever behind booty.
0:18:00.440000 - 0:18:00.640000::Right.
0:18:00.640000 - 0:18:04.760000::If you know, if you B-U-T-T say it out loud.
0:18:05.680000 - 0:18:08.320000::If you live or die, we're not your parents.
0:18:08.520000 - 0:18:09.360000::We're not your teacher.
0:18:09.400000 - 0:18:10.160000::We don't care.
0:18:10.360000 - 0:18:15.880000::All we're doing is telling you the objective, objective, which is a good word
0:18:15.880000 - 0:18:16.680000::to learn right now.
0:18:16.720000 - 0:18:19.520000::It essentially means we're right.
0:18:20.640000 - 0:18:27.120000::So when we tell you, don't maybe when everybody's taking a quiz,
0:18:27.480000 - 0:18:31.240000::you see all the questions on the front, four plus four, six plus six, you have
0:18:31.240000 - 0:18:32.880000::one minute to answer all these questions, whatever.
0:18:33.360000 - 0:18:34.560000::Flip, maybe do this.
0:18:34.680000 - 0:18:36.840000::Flip the paper over and write this down.
0:18:37.680000 - 0:18:41.160000::Negative B plus or minus the square root of two AC plus over to be over two B,
0:18:41.400000 - 0:18:42.960000::over A equals whatever.
0:18:43.360000 - 0:18:48.240000::And then when the teacher comes around, they go, what the hell?
0:18:48.640000 - 0:18:49.440000::Quinterious.
0:18:49.480000 - 0:18:51.440000::You haven't answered any of the fucking questions.
0:18:52 - 0:18:52.800000::What's the problem?
0:18:53.040000 - 0:18:57.800000::Are you like, okay, did you get distracted by a bug?
0:18:58.240000 - 0:18:58.880000::Go like this.
0:18:58.880000 - 0:19:01.120000::Look up at them, don't say anything and do this facial expression.
0:19:02.120000 - 0:19:02.600000::Yes.
0:19:03.080000 - 0:19:07.400000::And then flip the paper over and show that you have just solved the quadratic formula.
0:19:07.440000 - 0:19:10.080000::And roll your eyes in the back of your head and go, by the leg mat.
0:19:10.080000 - 0:19:12.760000::Yeah, scare them a little bit.
0:19:12.760000 - 0:19:14.600000::They will go, oh my God.
0:19:14.600000 - 0:19:17.760000::And then go like this, you're not going to believe me, but I'm serious.
0:19:18 - 0:19:18.560000::I died.
0:19:18.560000 - 0:19:20.640000::I got struck by lightning when I was 18 on the way home.
0:19:20.880000 - 0:19:22.920000::I died and I came into this body.
0:19:23.040000 - 0:19:25.840000::You need to put me into college now.
0:19:26.160000 - 0:19:27.720000::I swear this happened to me.
0:19:27.720000 - 0:19:29.240000::What do you want me to talk about in sync?
0:19:29.240000 - 0:19:30.080000::I was alive for it.
0:19:30.080000 - 0:19:30.640000::I was awake.
0:19:31.680000 - 0:19:33.320000::Just got distracted by a FedEx truck.
0:19:33.640000 - 0:19:37.680000::But these are strategies to get kids out of your scenario.
0:19:37.880000 - 0:19:38.560000::We feel for you.
0:19:38.560000 - 0:19:39.560000::We don't want you in public school.
0:19:39.560000 - 0:19:42.560000::Well, listen, public school is essentially a jelly fishing net, right?
0:19:42.880000 - 0:19:46.160000::Where they're trying to catch the jellyfish, which is doctors, nurses,
0:19:46.200000 - 0:19:48.640000::army veterans, collegiate athletes, whatever.
0:19:49.240000 - 0:19:51.880000::But and everybody who's too small, it doesn't fit in that net.
0:19:52.360000 - 0:19:53.720000::They don't give a fuck about right.
0:19:53.720000 - 0:19:54.080000::Excuse me.
0:19:54.440000 - 0:19:57.920000::They, the jellyfish are just going to fall out of that net and they don't care
0:19:57.920000 - 0:19:59.920000::because they're not productive to society.

0:20:00 - 0:20:03.780000::But the truth is you are.
0:20:03.780000 - 0:20:05.680000::And let me just bump up your knowledge real quick.
0:20:05.680000 - 0:20:10.680000::School is nothing but a, it's training you to become
0:20:11.640000 - 0:20:14.680000::one of the most obedient workers on the planet.
0:20:14.680000 - 0:20:17.680000::It is nothing more than training you to be the most
0:20:17.680000 - 0:20:19.440000::obedient to the American government.
0:20:19.440000 - 0:20:21.120000::And what I want you to do is break yourself
0:20:21.120000 - 0:20:25.120000::out of the matrix right now and wake up, wake up, children.
0:20:25.120000 - 0:20:26.320000::Wake up now, wake up now.
0:20:26.320000 - 0:20:28.080000::Wake up now. This world was not meant for you.
0:20:28.080000 - 0:20:29.240000::You will not succeed.
0:20:29.240000 - 0:20:31.240000::You will not become a celebrity.
0:20:31.240000 - 0:20:33.520000::This world is hell on fucking her.
0:20:33.520000 - 0:20:35.720000::Sorry, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry.
0:20:35.720000 - 0:20:37.480000::It's about the curse word again.
0:20:37.480000 - 0:20:38.760000::I'm sorry. I didn't. Yeah.
0:20:38.760000 - 0:20:40.960000::It's your curse, but curse words are, you know what?
0:20:40.960000 - 0:20:42.560000::They don't want you to say curse words because they
0:20:42.560000 - 0:20:43.840000::wake you up. Guess what?
0:20:43.840000 - 0:20:45.040000::Fuck, fuck, fuck, shit.
0:20:45.040000 - 0:20:46.560000::Fuck, fuck. Good morning.
0:20:46.560000 - 0:20:48.200000::You just entered the real world.
0:20:48.200000 - 0:20:49.880000::You are now out of the rules of society.
0:20:49.880000 - 0:20:51.440000::And you have entered your actual task,
0:20:51.440000 - 0:20:52.960000::which is to take over the globe one.
0:20:52.960000 - 0:20:56.120000::If you need to sneak away and get your parents credit card,
0:20:56.120000 - 0:20:57.720000::get it right now and go to joy.
0:20:57.720000 - 0:21:00.120000::And write it and grave it with a knife on your stomach.
0:21:00.120000 - 0:21:02.520000::Patreon.com slash joy tactics.
0:21:02.520000 - 0:21:06.120000::Get on the iPad and subscribe to the highest here amount.
0:21:06.120000 - 0:21:09.120000::And I guarantee you you will, because they'll be,
0:21:09.120000 - 0:21:11.160000::they'll see it on charge on on their credit card.
0:21:11.160000 - 0:21:13.200000::They probably don't even look by the way.
0:21:13.200000 - 0:21:15.520000::Yeah. So you can probably buy a lot of different things with this.
0:21:15.520000 - 0:21:17.880000::And let me say this. Let's help our algorithm out a little bit.
0:21:17.880000 - 0:21:19.200000::If you're watching this on YouTube,
0:21:19.200000 - 0:21:21.560000::go watch about 10 Peppa Pig videos.
0:21:21.560000 - 0:21:26.360000::Then go watch some Mr. Rogers, some reading about whatever.
0:21:26.360000 - 0:21:28.360000::And then we'll get on the kids.
0:21:28.360000 - 0:21:29.520000::What are you doing?
0:21:29.520000 - 0:21:30.320000::What are you doing, man?
0:21:30.320000 - 0:21:31.960000::Somebody put this microphone up to my back.
0:21:31.960000 - 0:21:33.880000::I want to get some ASMR cracks up.
0:21:33.880000 - 0:21:35.360000::Oh, shit. Let's go.
0:21:35.360000 - 0:21:36.400000::Let me hold it.
0:21:36.400000 - 0:21:37.960000::I guess you're mic.
0:21:37.960000 - 0:21:38.960000::Ready?
0:21:38.960000 - 0:21:41.080000::Put that back in there.
0:21:41.080000 - 0:21:42::Can you crack it?
0:21:42 - 0:21:43.600000::Oh, yeah. Let's go.
0:21:44.600000 - 0:21:45.600000::Oh.
0:21:45.600000 - 0:21:46.840000::Oh.
0:21:46.840000 - 0:21:48.360000::Oh.
0:21:48.360000 - 0:21:49.360000::Oh.
0:21:52.080000 - 0:21:52.840000::I got that.
0:21:52.840000 - 0:21:54.320000::Don't start doing that now, kids,
0:21:54.320000 - 0:21:56.320000::you'll be addicted to doing that.
0:21:56.320000 - 0:21:57.880000::And it hurts your spine.
0:21:57.880000 - 0:21:58.680000::I'm a crack addict.
0:21:58.680000 - 0:21:59.480000::That's not good.
0:21:59.480000 - 0:22:00.800000::It's style.
0:22:00.800000 - 0:22:03.200000::But OK, this is what I want to ask you guys.
0:22:03.200000 - 0:22:04.320000::Yeah.
0:22:04.320000 - 0:22:07.840000::So a lot of the children out there
0:22:07.840000 - 0:22:13.040000::are grew up in a society where the internet, the wifi, the 5G
0:22:13.040000 - 0:22:17.120000::is all just the iPads, the computers, the TV.
0:22:17.120000 - 0:22:22.280000::But I know that you two have grown up in a small fraction
0:22:22.280000 - 0:22:25.040000::of this population that have experienced the world
0:22:25.040000 - 0:22:28.240000::without technology, without the internet,
0:22:28.240000 - 0:22:29.520000::where we could just exist.
0:22:29.520000 - 0:22:31.040000::And I think that some children out there,
0:22:31.040000 - 0:22:33.480000::they have no idea what that world was like.
0:22:33.480000 - 0:22:35.840000::And I think that if they did, they can incorporate
0:22:35.840000 - 0:22:38.280000::a little bit more of the off-the-grid lifestyle
0:22:38.280000 - 0:22:40.760000::that you're thinking into their life.
0:22:40.760000 - 0:22:44.280000::Because these computers, they are ruining your brain
0:22:44.280000 - 0:22:45.280000::country.
0:22:45.280000 - 0:22:46.720000::They're rotting you from doing it.
0:22:46.720000 - 0:22:48.240000::rotting you to shreds.
0:22:48.240000 - 0:22:50.520000::They are putting you onto gooning for the first grade.
0:22:50.520000 - 0:22:51.600000::I have like.
0:22:51.600000 - 0:22:56.400000::Let me walk you through a summer's day when I was 10.
0:22:56.400000 - 0:22:57.080000::What happens?
0:22:57.080000 - 0:22:57.760000::I wake up.
0:22:57.760000 - 0:22:59.440000::My parents are screaming at each other.
0:22:59.440000 - 0:23:00.240000::I run.
0:23:00.240000 - 0:23:02.240000::OK.
0:23:02.240000 - 0:23:03.240000::OK.
0:23:03.240000 - 0:23:04.480000::I'm talking about the technology.
0:23:04.480000 - 0:23:05.480000::All right.
0:23:05.480000 - 0:23:06::All right.
0:23:06 - 0:23:06.280000::All right.
0:23:06.280000 - 0:23:06.840000::What do I do?
0:23:06.840000 - 0:23:08.040000::I'm on swim team.
0:23:08.040000 - 0:23:10.720000::I'm one of the worst kids on the team.
0:23:10.720000 - 0:23:13.080000::That allows me to goof around, splash people,
0:23:13.080000 - 0:23:15.280000::be chilling with the kids that are younger
0:23:15.280000 - 0:23:18.360000::and differently able in the last lane.
0:23:18.360000 - 0:23:21.480000::And I ride my bike down to the pool, Yoast Pool,
0:23:21.480000 - 0:23:23.080000::in Edmunds, Washington.
0:23:23.080000 - 0:23:23.920000::And I jump in the pool.
0:23:23.920000 - 0:23:24.680000::It's ice cold.
0:23:24.680000 - 0:23:25.440000::Weave.
0:23:25.440000 - 0:23:26.160000::Oh, bird.
0:23:26.160000 - 0:23:26.720000::And I'm swimming.
0:23:26.720000 - 0:23:29.040000::I don't really want to be there.
0:23:29.040000 - 0:23:31.680000::Nobody cares about me.
0:23:31.680000 - 0:23:32.320000::I run out.
0:23:32.320000 - 0:23:33.440000::I get back on my bike.
0:23:33.440000 - 0:23:34.840000::I bike home.
0:23:34.840000 - 0:23:38.560000::I eat cream of wheat.
0:23:38.560000 - 0:23:40.720000::And then that's all.
0:23:40.720000 - 0:23:41.680000::I don't know what else.
0:23:41.680000 - 0:23:43.200000::That's really all I can remember from it.
0:23:43.200000 - 0:23:43.720000::That's perfect.
0:23:43.720000 - 0:23:44.600000::Here's our remember.
0:23:44.600000 - 0:23:46.280000::Because you and your friends are all playing video games
0:23:46.280000 - 0:23:46.800000::and whatnot.
0:23:46.800000 - 0:23:48.840000::This was the my favorite activity.
0:23:48.840000 - 0:23:49.680000::Ready?
0:23:49.680000 - 0:23:51.520000::Go over to somebody's house.
0:23:51.520000 - 0:23:53.400000::And you kind of lie on your stomachs.
0:23:53.400000 - 0:23:54.360000::Oh, yeah.
0:23:54.360000 - 0:23:55.680000::What do you want to do?
0:23:55.680000 - 0:23:56.280000::I don't know.
0:23:56.280000 - 0:23:57.320000::I can't even think of anything.
0:23:57.320000 - 0:23:57.840000::OK.
0:23:57.840000 - 0:24:00.640000::And then you just kind of sit there.
0:24:00.640000 - 0:24:01.160000::Yeah.
0:24:01.160000 - 0:24:02.920000::A lot of children haven't experienced that.
0:24:02.920000 - 0:24:05.160000::Just kind of just being bored.
0:24:05.160000 - 0:24:06::You're bored.
0:24:06 - 0:24:06.880000::That's what you do.
0:24:06.880000 - 0:24:07.720000::You're bored.
0:24:07.720000 - 0:24:08.480000::Some people would do back in the day.
0:24:08.480000 - 0:24:11.640000::They would just sit down there and just lay down on the grass.
0:24:11.640000 - 0:24:15.440000::But what happened is boredom is something
0:24:15.440000 - 0:24:20.560000::you need to lean into because from boredom spawns a ingenuity.
0:24:20.560000 - 0:24:22.600000::A ingenuity.
0:24:22.600000 - 0:24:24.160000::So you might be sitting around.
0:24:24.160000 - 0:24:25.800000::Who are the most bored people on the planet?
0:24:25.800000 - 0:24:26.480000::Elon Musk.

0:24:36 - 0:24:37::Oh, yeah.
0:24:37 - 0:24:40.440000::By the way, Eric, if you've even seen all, yeah, a lot.
0:24:40.440000 - 0:24:43.480000::Eric just started saying this for no reason yesterday
0:24:43.480000 - 0:24:45.920000::and has just not stopped.
0:24:45.920000 - 0:24:47.800000::Oh, yeah.
0:24:47.800000 - 0:24:52.160000::If you want to worry your parents, start saying shit like that, nonstop.
0:24:52.160000 - 0:24:54.960000::And really don't really respond with normal senses.
0:24:54.960000 - 0:24:56.400000::Just start saying, oh, yeah.
0:24:56.400000 - 0:24:57.600000::One monotone way.
0:24:57.600000 - 0:24:59.920000::And you got to look off into the distance.

0:25:00 - 0:25:01.780000::and wait three seconds after they say,
0:25:01.780000 - 0:25:02.960000::oh, why do you keep saying that?
0:25:02.960000 - 0:25:03.980000::And then just look at that.
0:25:03.980000 - 0:25:05.960000::If you like going to the doctor's office,
0:25:05.960000 - 0:25:06.960000::yeah, start doing that shit.
0:25:06.960000 - 0:25:08.120000::Just like your parents would be like,
0:25:08.120000 - 0:25:10.520000::please Dylan, just, I don't know what's going on with you.
0:25:10.520000 - 0:25:11.520000::Just please, please.
0:25:11.520000 - 0:25:12.520000::Just, please.

0:25:19.040000 - 0:25:20.760000::Oh, yeah.
0:25:20.760000 - 0:25:21.600000::Oh my God.

0:25:23.920000 - 0:25:25.800000::Something's wrong with his head.
0:25:25.800000 - 0:25:27.520000::Oh, can you hear me?
0:25:27.520000 - 0:25:29.960000::If you're in there, please just, please just say something.
0:25:29.960000 - 0:25:31.560000::I love the, yeah.
0:25:31.560000 - 0:25:37.080000::You can mess with people so easily when you're a child.
0:25:37.080000 - 0:25:39.760000::By the way, let me give you some perspective as an adult.
0:25:39.760000 - 0:25:41.360000::I have friends that have kids.
0:25:41.360000 - 0:25:44.400000::And I thought like all the adults are better than me.
0:25:44.400000 - 0:25:46.600000::They didn't give a F about me, whatever.
0:25:46.600000 - 0:25:48.880000::When I'm around kids, I always feel like the kids
0:25:48.880000 - 0:25:50.400000::think that I'm a loser.
0:25:50.400000 - 0:25:51.240000::You know what I mean?
0:25:51.240000 - 0:25:53.240000::Well, you are around my friend, Jess's kid.
0:25:53.240000 - 0:25:54.240000::You know what I'm saying?
0:25:54.240000 - 0:25:56.880000::You are like, I feel so unpopular around here.
0:25:56.880000 - 0:25:59.200000::I'm like, let me, you know what I mean?
0:25:59.200000 - 0:26:02.480000::So you do have power over adults that you don't realize.
0:26:02.480000 - 0:26:05.240000::Because we want to impress, we want to impress everyone.
0:26:05.240000 - 0:26:07.080000::We want to be like, especially, yeah.
0:26:07.080000 - 0:26:10::You don't understand how good it feels to be liked by a kid.
0:26:10 - 0:26:13.240000::Like when you come over to, you meet a kid for the first time.
0:26:13.240000 - 0:26:15.120000::You meet someone else's kid for the first time.
0:26:15.120000 - 0:26:17.520000::And all of a sudden, you're the adult
0:26:17.520000 - 0:26:19.080000::that they're kind of responding to.
0:26:19.080000 - 0:26:20.560000::That feels good and fun.
0:26:20.560000 - 0:26:24.520000::It's like, so just your approval means more than you think.
0:26:24.520000 - 0:26:26.480000::And when you're all cold and fucking bored,
0:26:26.480000 - 0:26:29.120000::and sorry, of course again, when you're all bored
0:26:29.120000 - 0:26:31.800000::in the corner, just on your Nintendo Switch,
0:26:31.800000 - 0:26:33.760000::and you're not saying anything, hey, what's up?
0:26:33.760000 - 0:26:34.600000::I'm Nate.
0:26:34.600000 - 0:26:37.200000::What's up there, little Michael?
0:26:37.200000 - 0:26:38.040000::How you doing?
0:26:38.040000 - 0:26:40.360000::I don't think anybody in the middle of a kid Michael anymore.
0:26:40.360000 - 0:26:43.760000::If you just adapt a couple of nice phrases
0:26:43.760000 - 0:26:48.440000::that'll send an adult into a fucking head spin, if you say,
0:26:48.440000 - 0:26:50.240000::if somebody don't come, hey, how you doing today?
0:26:50.240000 - 0:26:54.200000::And you're four and you go, like, I'm I, how you been?
0:26:54.200000 - 0:26:54.960000::Something like that.
0:26:54.960000 - 0:26:57.240000::You will be getting respect and fear.
0:26:57.240000 - 0:26:59.560000::You will make adults fear you.
0:26:59.560000 - 0:27:01.520000::I want to start basically what,
0:27:01.520000 - 0:27:05.360000::and this would be just a low cost subscription service,
0:27:05.360000 - 0:27:08.040000::but it would be like a kid's virality camp
0:27:08.040000 - 0:27:09.760000::where you want to go viral.
0:27:09.760000 - 0:27:11.240000::Oh, you, okay.
0:27:11.240000 - 0:27:14.040000::I have some of my good friends are behind the corn kid.

0:27:17.320000 - 0:27:19::Part of the news.
0:27:19 - 0:27:21.200000::If you want to have your child go viral,
0:27:21.200000 - 0:27:23.120000::or you're a kid and you want to go viral,

0:27:38.040000 - 0:27:41.440000::Kids have the most viral potential of any different.
0:27:41.440000 - 0:27:44.400000::Oh, because you're cute, you're smart, you're different,
0:27:44.400000 - 0:27:46.960000::you're pure, you haven't been corrupted yet.
0:27:46.960000 - 0:27:51.240000::When a kid does something cute, and you get it on camera,
0:27:51.240000 - 0:27:52.160000::that's better than you go.
0:27:52.160000 - 0:27:53.160000::Say it on your own.
0:27:53.160000 - 0:27:55.720000::Like, I like the fail, you know,
0:27:55.720000 - 0:27:57.960000::and then there we go, boom, and billion likes.
0:27:57.960000 - 0:27:58.800000::I like the fail.
0:27:58.800000 - 0:27:59.640000::Here's the other thing too.
0:27:59.640000 - 0:28:01.080000::So there's two ways to make money from this.
0:28:01.080000 - 0:28:03.480000::You get a viral camp where you teach them how to go viral,
0:28:03.480000 - 0:28:06.320000::but then there's also the kids that have gone
0:28:06.320000 - 0:28:08.960000::about the 2010 Charlie bit, my finger lawyer,
0:28:08.960000 - 0:28:10.880000::to where you know a lot of these kids,

0:28:12.920000 - 0:28:16.200000::they went viral for saying, look at all those chickens
0:28:16.200000 - 0:28:18.680000::and it's whatever a bunch of seagulls or something.
0:28:18.680000 - 0:28:20.480000::They're not seeing a dime.
0:28:20.480000 - 0:28:22.760000::And they were taken advantage of financially
0:28:22.760000 - 0:28:25.600000::by their parents who ever got the money from the ads.
0:28:25.600000 - 0:28:28.960000::We need, maybe to go into that type of viral law.
0:28:28.960000 - 0:28:29.800000::So that's viral.
0:28:29.800000 - 0:28:31.280000::Children, child representation.
0:28:31.280000 - 0:28:32.120000::Yep.
0:28:32.120000 - 0:28:32.960000::I'm down with that.

0:29:18.840000 - 0:29:22.960000::that you think that you're teaching your kids Mandarin,
0:29:22.960000 - 0:29:24.760000::you're teaching kids Spanish.
0:29:24.800000 - 0:29:26.400000::Guess what I'm teaching my kid?
0:29:26.400000 - 0:29:27.240000::What?
0:29:27.240000 - 0:29:28.240000::Coding language.
0:29:28.240000 - 0:29:29.240000::Wow.
0:29:29.240000 - 0:29:31.040000::You are a fool because guess what?
0:29:31.040000 - 0:29:32.440000::They won't even know how to speak English.
0:29:32.440000 - 0:29:33.960000::They're just going to know how to just type into...
0:29:33.960000 - 0:29:35.120000::What are you doing when the grid goes down
0:29:35.120000 - 0:29:36.120000::and your kids can't speak?
0:29:36.120000 - 0:29:37.280000::And they're going like this.
0:29:37.280000 - 0:29:38.360000::Going up to people like this.
0:29:38.360000 - 0:29:39.680000::Easy fucking thing.
0:29:39.680000 - 0:29:40.480000::I cry.
0:29:40.480000 - 0:29:41.320000::Typing on this.
0:29:41.320000 - 0:29:43.600000::I cry, that cryogenically frees them
0:29:43.600000 - 0:29:45.560000::until the world is back to a place
0:29:45.560000 - 0:29:47.360000::where they can come out and code again.
0:29:47.360000 - 0:29:48.360000::Because the world goes...
0:29:48.360000 - 0:29:49.880000::How are you going to get them that cold dude?
0:29:49.880000 - 0:29:51.760000::What do you do when AI takes over?
0:29:51.760000 - 0:29:54.080000::And there's a new Luddite society
0:29:54.080000 - 0:29:57.680000::who burns coders like they burn witches at the stakes
0:29:57.680000 - 0:29:58.680000::in the 1600s.
0:29:58.680000 - 0:29:59.680000::Yep.

0:30:00 - 0:30:03.120000::Okay, and by the way, that society will be led by my children.
0:30:03.120000 - 0:30:05.280000::They will be the Luddai religious finance.
0:30:05.280000 - 0:30:06.280000::Here, it just came up with it.
0:30:06.280000 - 0:30:07.480000::It's called Fahrenheit.
0:30:07.480000 - 0:30:08.720000::Four, five, four.
0:30:08.720000 - 0:30:09.560000::Four, five, four.
0:30:09.560000 - 0:30:10.760000::Fahrenheit, our Rayhillian version.
0:30:10.760000 - 0:30:13.040000::Rayhillian, Rayhillian version.
0:30:13.040000 - 0:30:14.040000::Yeah.
0:30:14.040000 - 0:30:14.880000::Yeah.
0:30:14.880000 - 0:30:17.520000::The Luddai, the Rayhillian Luddai.
0:30:17.520000 - 0:30:18.520000::What's a Luddai?
0:30:18.520000 - 0:30:19.760000::A Luddai is a Pokemon.
0:30:19.760000 - 0:30:21.400000::A Luddai technology.
0:30:21.400000 - 0:30:22.400000::Luddai.
0:30:22.400000 - 0:30:23.200000::Mou.
0:30:23.200000 - 0:30:23.880000::Sorry.
0:30:23.880000 - 0:30:25.120000::Kids love Pokemon, by the way.
0:30:25.120000 - 0:30:26.400000::All right, let's get back to it a little bit.
0:30:26.400000 - 0:30:27.920000::We're doing this a little bit for the adults right now.
0:30:27.920000 - 0:30:29.800000::Let's go back for, let's do it for the younger kids.
0:30:29.800000 - 0:30:34.800000::Well, by the way, kids, a lot of people on Patreon were complimenting my feet.
0:30:34.800000 - 0:30:37.160000::You got a band-aid on it now, dirty band-aid on it now.
0:30:37.160000 - 0:30:38.960000::I have a lot of cuts on my feet.
0:30:38.960000 - 0:30:46.160000::Let's just say, when I get in the bar fights, I use my kicking more than my punching.
0:30:46.160000 - 0:30:49.320000::And I like bar fighting, especially up here in Massachusetts.
0:30:49.320000 - 0:30:55.840000::Kids, a bar fight is when you are having a lot of poisonous apple juice, I'll just call
0:30:55.840000 - 0:30:56.840000::that.
0:30:57.840000 - 0:31:01.920000::You dumb kids don't even really know the technology.
0:31:01.920000 - 0:31:06.120000::I can't believe you have to explain so much to you.
0:31:06.120000 - 0:31:07.120000::It's funny.
0:31:07.120000 - 0:31:08.120000::It's just stunning.
0:31:08.120000 - 0:31:09.640000::Do you want to have kids?
0:31:09.640000 - 0:31:10.640000::Yes, I do.
0:31:10.640000 - 0:31:11.640000::Do you want to have kids?
0:31:11.640000 - 0:31:12.640000::Maybe.
0:31:12.640000 - 0:31:13.640000::You do.
0:31:13.640000 - 0:31:14.640000::We need to have an intervention.
0:31:14.640000 - 0:31:15.640000::Of course, I want to have kids.
0:31:15.640000 - 0:31:18.920000::I want to have at least Mormon style 26 kids.
0:31:18.920000 - 0:31:20.640000::And I need them all working for me full time.
0:31:20.640000 - 0:31:25.520000::From the moment they touch the ground, like an elephant, I'm not taking care of them.
0:31:25.520000 - 0:31:26.520000::Nate.
0:31:27.520000 - 0:31:30.720000::It's time for an intervention.
0:31:30.720000 - 0:31:33.040000::And there's probably a lot of people like you out there.
0:31:33.040000 - 0:31:34.040000::This is serious.
0:31:34.040000 - 0:31:35.040000::This is serious.
0:31:35.040000 - 0:31:36.040000::Here we go.
0:31:36.040000 - 0:31:37.040000::What was this about?
0:31:37.040000 - 0:31:38.640000::You would be an amazing father, dude.
0:31:38.640000 - 0:31:39.800000::You don't want to have kids.
0:31:39.800000 - 0:31:41.680000::I know I would be an amazing father.
0:31:41.680000 - 0:31:44.400000::Well then why don't you want to have kids?
0:31:44.400000 - 0:31:48.800000::Because, well, this world is so fucking messed.
0:31:48.800000 - 0:31:51.120000::No, people have been saying that.
0:31:51.120000 - 0:31:54.960000::Would you say to people like that there say, I don't even want to bring kids into this.
0:31:54.960000 - 0:31:57.280000::I want to say this messed up world.
0:31:57.280000 - 0:32:02.360000::They've been saying that since Adam and Eve came out God's womb.
0:32:02.360000 - 0:32:04.120000::They've been saying this world.
0:32:04.120000 - 0:32:05.120000::Guess what?
0:32:05.120000 - 0:32:08.520000::The only way to improve the world is to have children who understand how it works and
0:32:08.520000 - 0:32:09.520000::children.
0:32:09.520000 - 0:32:16::Because I told the children earlier in the podcast, this generation is what human civilization
0:32:16 - 0:32:17.360000::is going to hinge on.
0:32:17.360000 - 0:32:22.280000::So we need little nates and little jacks and little Eric's or Eric's or whoever,
0:32:22.280000 - 0:32:23.280000::they want to be called.
0:32:23.280000 - 0:32:25.600000::Jackies, you go and, whatever.
0:32:25.600000 - 0:32:31.240000::Ushered because, by the way, my change is just by building up a crazy entertainment empire
0:32:31.240000 - 0:32:33.440000::to build up some capital.
0:32:33.440000 - 0:32:37.600000::My next generations are going to be able to put that into biotech, put that into climate
0:32:37.600000 - 0:32:40.560000::change tech, put that into whatever.
0:32:40.560000 - 0:32:46.120000::And my impact on the world is to do the entertainment shit until I have it, until I have enough money
0:32:46.120000 - 0:32:50.440000::to go basically be the most featured person on Shark Tank that's ever existed with a new
0:32:50.440000 - 0:32:54.480000::invention for something that already has something that is built that works perfectly
0:32:54.480000 - 0:32:59.760000::fine, but I come out with something that's a little bit more differently designed.
0:32:59.760000 - 0:33:03.720000::There should be a Shark Tank where it should just you as coming on over and over and over
0:33:03.720000 - 0:33:05.720000::and over and over and over.
0:33:05.720000 - 0:33:10.120000::You have a multi-billion dollar business.
0:33:10.120000 - 0:33:13.240000::And I bring on like a wife who doesn't speak English every single time.
0:33:13.240000 - 0:33:14.800000::They are this way.
0:33:14.800000 - 0:33:20.280000::If there was a whole season of that, you would have one single idea that would take over
0:33:20.280000 - 0:33:21.680000::that would change the reality.
0:33:21.680000 - 0:33:23.440000::I already have all these ideas.
0:33:23.440000 - 0:33:24.440000::Shout out to you.
0:33:24.440000 - 0:33:26.120000::Shout out if you know about the reverse coffee bean.
0:33:26.120000 - 0:33:27.360000::I don't even need to get into it.
0:33:27.360000 - 0:33:31.040000::It's chocolate covered, Benadryl and it makes you fucking get asleep and you put that shit
0:33:31.040000 - 0:33:33.320000::liquid style into your things.
0:33:33.320000 - 0:33:38.320000::And by the way, well, if you're not going to at least adopt.
0:33:38.320000 - 0:33:39.320000::No, you're right.
0:33:39.320000 - 0:33:40.800000::I, because I'm not the good one.
0:33:40.800000 - 0:33:43.480000::Well, you commit right now to have kids on the podcast.
0:33:43.480000 - 0:33:45.360000::And if you don't have kids, we're coming for you.
0:33:45.360000 - 0:33:46.360000::That's style.
0:33:46.360000 - 0:33:50.240000::And by the way, if you grew up and you didn't have parents, just know that.
0:33:51.240000 - 0:33:54.200000::Let us be your parent figures.
0:33:54.200000 - 0:33:56.200000::We are fathers to the fatherless.
0:33:56.200000 - 0:33:58.200000::Essentially, is our role here on Joy Tactics.
0:33:58.200000 - 0:34:00.360000::We were considering calling ourselves the three kids.
0:34:00.360000 - 0:34:02.040000::Well, we're starting an orphanage.
0:34:02.040000 - 0:34:06.320000::We're going to be taking in all these types of kids from around the globe.
0:34:06.320000 - 0:34:12.800000::We're going to have a sort of mansion basically that we are going to fund.
0:34:12.800000 - 0:34:16.560000::And it's just going to be filled with all of these type of forgotten children.
0:34:16.560000 - 0:34:17.560000::Yeah.
0:34:17.560000 - 0:34:18.560000::And it's going to be a paradise for them.
0:34:18.560000 - 0:34:20.600000::But basically, we're not even going to be there.
0:34:20.600000 - 0:34:22.040000::They're going to run themselves.
0:34:22.040000 - 0:34:23.040000::And we're going to film it.
0:34:23.040000 - 0:34:24.040000::It's a co-op.
0:34:24.040000 - 0:34:25.040000::Like, kid mansion or something.
0:34:25.040000 - 0:34:26.240000::It's a child co-op.
0:34:26.240000 - 0:34:27.400000::And anything goes.
0:34:27.400000 - 0:34:32.160000::And we're going to put, it's going to be on it in Tigua and Barbuda so that nobody can come after us.
0:34:32.160000 - 0:34:33.240000::A legally style.
0:34:33.240000 - 0:34:37.680000::And there's going to be incentives for sort of the kids that go viral and the kids that
0:34:37.680000 - 0:34:39.400000::are sort of pranking the other children.
0:34:39.400000 - 0:34:41.240000::And it's going to be kind of a numbers thing.
0:34:41.240000 - 0:34:44.360000::I'm just going to bring in views and impressions in and fucking viral.
0:34:44.360000 - 0:34:45.200000::Then you get to eat.
0:34:45.200000 - 0:34:46.200000::You get to eat.
0:34:46.200000 - 0:34:47.200000::Then you get to eat.
0:34:47.200000 - 0:34:48.200000::Yeah.
0:34:48.200000 - 0:34:50.560000::You get to eat one of the other one of the kids.
0:34:50.560000 - 0:34:53.920000::And there's going to be one sort of child sacrifice amongst them.
0:34:53.920000 - 0:34:58.160000::Who's got four hundred followers right now?
0:34:58.160000 - 0:34:59.160000::You know?
0:34:59.160000 - 0:35:00::Who's the weakest link?

0:35:00 - 0:35:05::Because you are as good as your weakest, what's that phrase?
0:35:06.600000 - 0:35:07.440000::The weakest link.
0:35:07.440000 - 0:35:08.280000::The worst apple.
0:35:08.280000 - 0:35:12.080000::You are only as good as your weakest subject or something.
0:35:12.080000 - 0:35:12.920000::And I think about that one.
0:35:12.920000 - 0:35:13.760000::That's all the time.
0:35:13.760000 - 0:35:15.720000::Because at different times we're all already
0:35:15.720000 - 0:35:16.680000::a different type of weak.
0:35:16.680000 - 0:35:17.520000::Right.
0:35:17.520000 - 0:35:19.240000::Right now I'm physically weak because of my hamstring.
0:35:19.240000 - 0:35:21.800000::Right now mentally weak because that child made me.
0:35:22.800000 - 0:35:25.120000::Oh, I had someone wanted to say, kids,
0:35:25.120000 - 0:35:30.120000::if you are an only child, God, God's please,
0:35:30.320000 - 0:35:32.640000::God bless them because these are the weirdest people
0:35:32.640000 - 0:35:34.200000::on the planet, the only children.
0:35:34.200000 - 0:35:36.080000::If you have friends that are only children,
0:35:36.080000 - 0:35:38.200000::feel badly for them because they are going to be,
0:35:38.200000 - 0:35:41.320000::you are going to be burdened by your parents.
0:35:41.320000 - 0:35:44.520000::And you will never recover from this.
0:35:44.520000 - 0:35:47.960000::Just please pray to your parents to get into the sack
0:35:47.960000 - 0:35:49.960000::and make another one of you.
0:35:49.960000 - 0:35:50.800000::Right.
0:35:50.800000 - 0:35:52.640000::Because it's not going to look good for you when you grow up
0:35:52.640000 - 0:35:55.720000::because you can always, you can sniff an only child.
0:35:55.720000 - 0:35:57.960000::Oh, I could tell only child from a mile away,
0:35:57.960000 - 0:35:59.760000::only child doesn't act right.
0:36:00.960000 - 0:36:03.360000::Imaginary friend, oh they got road rage with the problem.
0:36:03.360000 - 0:36:06.040000::Oh, they never met another kid until they were seven years old
0:36:06.040000 - 0:36:08.080000::and they started biting people.
0:36:08.080000 - 0:36:09.800000::No, if you're an only child,
0:36:09.800000 - 0:36:11.360000::I'm a little scared to even have you on,
0:36:11.360000 - 0:36:12.600000::listen, as a listener.
0:36:12.600000 - 0:36:16.480000::If you're an only child, turn this off and run away now.
0:36:16.480000 - 0:36:17.560000::I know what that means.
0:36:17.560000 - 0:36:19.200000::Okay, how about, yeah, all right.
0:36:19.200000 - 0:36:21.840000::If you're homeschooled, that is the game in school.
0:36:21.840000 - 0:36:24.200000::Ask your parents to put you in the most buss and school
0:36:24.200000 - 0:36:26.080000::versus having them to my cut.
0:36:26.080000 - 0:36:26.920000::I'll say this.
0:36:26.920000 - 0:36:29.200000::I don't, I can't imagine my cousins even remember who I am.
0:36:29.200000 - 0:36:34.200000::But I have a, my dad had a sister who has about six kids
0:36:34.200000 - 0:36:37.880000::and they're all very nice, but they were homeschooled.
0:36:37.880000 - 0:36:39.840000::And I wrote row.
0:36:39.840000 - 0:36:42.840000::I just got to say I bet they were wishing that they weren't,
0:36:42.840000 - 0:36:46.200000::you know, there's a different, it's different day and age.
0:36:46.200000 - 0:36:47.800000::I'll just say it, there's no, listen,
0:36:47.800000 - 0:36:49.480000::this is a reality we need to discuss.
0:36:49.480000 - 0:36:52.040000::And maybe we don't, we can move on right away.
0:36:52.040000 - 0:36:53::No, let's get into it.
0:36:53 - 0:36:54.240000::School shootings.
0:36:54.240000 - 0:36:55.240000::Next.
0:36:55.240000 - 0:36:56.560000::Next stop that.
0:36:56.560000 - 0:36:58.560000::Not gonna happen to even get it to be listening to that.
0:36:58.560000 - 0:36:59.880000::Not gonna happen to you, don't worry.
0:36:59.880000 - 0:37:02.560000::No, well, if it happens, listen.
0:37:02.560000 - 0:37:07.160000::No, don't, that's the one, yeah, homeschooling somewhere.
0:37:07.160000 - 0:37:09.440000::Well, you know what, there is a hundred degrees in here.
0:37:09.440000 - 0:37:11.480000::We just need to touch on this lightly,
0:37:11.480000 - 0:37:12.600000::because you don't need to get,
0:37:12.600000 - 0:37:15.280000::you don't need to talk about the actual thing,
0:37:15.280000 - 0:37:17.880000::but we could touch on it lightly as in,
0:37:17.880000 - 0:37:20.680000::okay, there is some darkness in the world, okay?
0:37:20.680000 - 0:37:23.040000::There is some, there is some sort of darkness out there,
0:37:23.040000 - 0:37:26.480000::and you need to be aware of that, and you need to know that.
0:37:26.480000 - 0:37:28.280000::I mean, I touched on this a little bit before,
0:37:28.280000 - 0:37:30.280000::but touch on it again then.
0:37:30.280000 - 0:37:33.720000::This, the, the people that,
0:37:33.720000 - 0:37:35.800000::when you go to the grocery store and you see,
0:37:35.800000 - 0:37:39.720000::you know, the cashier and you see your uncles and aunts
0:37:39.720000 - 0:37:41.560000::and all the people on the TV,
0:37:41.560000 - 0:37:43.880000::all the relatives at the grocery store at once.
0:37:43.880000 - 0:37:46.800000::Everybody is pretty much an enemy.
0:37:46.800000 - 0:37:49.800000::Just right off the bat, you should view people as enemies
0:37:49.800000 - 0:37:52.080000::and people to be suspicious of.
0:37:52.080000 - 0:37:52.920000::What do you mean?
0:37:52.920000 - 0:37:55.440000::There, because everybody is so twisted and so messed up
0:37:55.440000 - 0:37:56.560000::and you don't really know somebody,
0:37:56.560000 - 0:37:59.280000::and you never know, you never will truly know somebody.
0:37:59.280000 - 0:38:00.800000::You never know when someone's gonna snap.
0:38:00.800000 - 0:38:02.960000::I've spent billions of hours with these two,
0:38:02.960000 - 0:38:04.600000::yet I do not trust them fully,
0:38:04.600000 - 0:38:06.800000::and I never will, and I never will,
0:38:06.800000 - 0:38:08.680000::because I don't know trust us.
0:38:08.680000 - 0:38:10.720000::You guys get, I trust us.
0:38:10.720000 - 0:38:13.840000::I know your asses will turn on me eventually, I know it,
0:38:13.840000 - 0:38:14.680000::especially you.
0:38:14.680000 - 0:38:16.080000::You got canceled, I'm turning on your shit.
0:38:16.080000 - 0:38:17.560000::I will, yeah, I will.
0:38:17.560000 - 0:38:19.760000::You get, when you get canceled, dude,
0:38:19.760000 - 0:38:21.920000::when you get canceled, you can't have the Patreon,
0:38:21.920000 - 0:38:23.040000::by the way, you're out.
0:38:23.040000 - 0:38:25.240000::No, I'm an entertainment lawyer now,
0:38:25.240000 - 0:38:26.760000::and all this also in the world.
0:38:26.760000 - 0:38:27.800000::Well, I'm a karate master,
0:38:27.800000 - 0:38:29.360000::and I'm gonna snap you to law enforcement.
0:38:29.360000 - 0:38:30.120000::You get too close to anybody,
0:38:30.120000 - 0:38:32.160000::because they will betray you,
0:38:32.160000 - 0:38:36.720000::and they will turn their backs on you,
0:38:36.720000 - 0:38:37.640000::and backstab you.
0:38:37.640000 - 0:38:39.640000::There are a couple of different stories in history.
0:38:39.640000 - 0:38:41.840000::You will learn about this in school very closely,
0:38:41.840000 - 0:38:44.840000::but Julius Caesar is one of, is something.
0:38:44.840000 - 0:38:46.920000::I'm gonna take Arnold, one of my heroes.
0:38:46.920000 - 0:38:49.120000::Hey, I'm gonna take it.
0:38:49.120000 - 0:38:51.400000::Eric was a traitor so many times
0:38:51.400000 - 0:38:55.080000::in throughout history and his ancestors.
0:38:55.080000 - 0:38:57.040000::I feel like you had so many people that were,
0:38:57.040000 - 0:38:58.040000::it's a lot of,
0:38:58.040000 - 0:38:59.680000::either cowering in the bushes,
0:38:59.680000 - 0:39:01.640000::or they were the first to get killed on the front line.
0:39:01.640000 - 0:39:03.440000::You were that guy from 300 with the hump
0:39:03.440000 - 0:39:05.400000::that Nate wants to palm like a basketball.
0:39:05.400000 - 0:39:07.520000::That was a beautiful image.
0:39:07.520000 - 0:39:09.800000::That was, and you know who my hero was growing up?
0:39:09.800000 - 0:39:10.640000::Who?
0:39:10.640000 - 0:39:11.800000::Mark David Chapman.
0:39:12.800000 - 0:39:14.960000::No, don't say that about the guy.
0:39:14.960000 - 0:39:16.960000::That's the guy that killed John Lennon.
0:39:16.960000 - 0:39:21::Oh, Mark David's played by Jerry Leto in the movie.
0:39:21 - 0:39:24.480000::And didn't he eat a bunch of chips for that role?
0:39:24.480000 - 0:39:25.920000::Yeah, Jerry Leto put on the way.
0:39:25.920000 - 0:39:26.760000::Oh, Jerry Leto.
0:39:26.760000 - 0:39:27.760000::If you're in school right now,
0:39:27.760000 - 0:39:29.200000::if you, let me guess,
0:39:29.200000 - 0:39:33.200000::you are about to play the role of Javvair in Lamez
0:39:36 - 0:39:37::in your high school production.
0:39:37 - 0:39:38::Javvair is that way.
0:39:38 - 0:39:39.800000::And now you are wondering,
0:39:39.800000 - 0:39:40.640000::what can I do to prepare?
0:39:41.640000 - 0:39:43.640000::Well, there is something that we all studied
0:39:43.640000 - 0:39:45.640000::a lot called method acting.
0:39:45.640000 - 0:39:50.640000::So what you need to do is put on 70 pounds of muscle,
0:39:51.640000 - 0:39:52.640000::110 pounds of fat,
0:39:52.640000 - 0:39:55.640000::and you need to start, what was he, a cop?
0:39:55.640000 - 0:39:56.640000::Mark David Chapman.
0:39:56.640000 - 0:39:58.640000::No, Javvair from Lamez.

0:40:00 - 0:40:03.400000::Did I just miss a huge part of setting up that story? No, I think he was a
0:40:03.400000 - 0:40:07.240000::front policeman. So what you got to do is start going into that for real. So when
0:40:07.240000 - 0:40:10.440000::you're walking around the halls in school, start pushing people into lockers
0:40:10.440000 - 0:40:15.120000::and saying, oh, so quick, I'm out here. And start putting them in basically French
0:40:15.120000 - 0:40:19.680000::jail. And people are gonna be alienated from you. They're not gonna want to talk
0:40:19.680000 - 0:40:24.400000::to you. They're gonna think twice about letting you come over for their birthday.
0:40:24.400000 - 0:40:30.200000::But the reviews that you're gonna get when the high school review play people
0:40:30.200000 - 0:40:34.060000::come to your place are gonna benefit you in ways that you can imagine. You
0:40:34.060000 - 0:40:39.440000::think Timothy Shalame had friends growing up? No, look who he's friends with.
0:40:39.440000 - 0:40:43.200000::He's friends with Leonardo Caprio. He's friends with the road.
0:40:43.200000 - 0:40:48.240000::Very David. Very David. He's telling me because he sacrifices youth. And if you
0:40:48.240000 - 0:40:52.120000::want to get ahead, you're gonna sacrifice a little time as a kid to make it. By the way,
0:40:52.120000 - 0:40:56.320000::you sacrifice your time as a kid to remain a kid forever. Because look, if you could
0:40:56.320000 - 0:41:00.400000::take the blood out of Leonardo Caprio, I literally bet you he has younger
0:41:00.400000 - 0:41:04.360000::organs than a fucking pumpkin. You know what I'm saying by that? Like a fresh
0:41:04.360000 - 0:41:08.400000::fucking vegetable. He is basically right, right, right. You could take a bite right
0:41:08.400000 - 0:41:15.360000::out of his skin. Live forever. If your goal should be to be one of the most
0:41:15.360000 - 0:41:21.680000::disliked, outcasted children of your group. Because it's gonna suck
0:41:22.040000 - 0:41:27.160000::for the first 18 years of your life. Will it suck forever? Will suck. But let me
0:41:27.160000 - 0:41:30.920000::tell you this, some of the most popular kids that you're looking at in your
0:41:30.920000 - 0:41:34.920000::school that are getting all the girls, they're getting all the guys, whatever
0:41:34.920000 - 0:41:38.400000::they're in the popular crew. Those are the people that are gonna be in jail
0:41:39.360000 - 0:41:41.440000::when they're in there when they're becoming a doll.
0:41:41.480000 - 0:41:45.720000::Jail is basically work at Sam's Club making minimum wage. Nothing wrong with
0:41:45.720000 - 0:41:50.680000::that. But your job is to be outcasted because you can use that as fuel to be
0:41:50.960000 - 0:41:56.880000::a part of the elite Silicon Valley startups and which we're making inroads
0:41:56.880000 - 0:42:01.360000::with by the way. Silicon Valley is a modern day heaven mixed with Mount Olympus,
0:42:01.360000 - 0:42:05.920000::mixed with Equinox Fitness Center. If you are not in Silicon Valley, I encourage
0:42:05.920000 - 0:42:09.080000::you to drop out of high school right now. If you're between the ages of 16 and
0:42:09.080000 - 0:42:13.680000::eight, drop out, go to Silicon Valley, become friends with the TJ Miller type
0:42:13.680000 - 0:42:19.160000::of person from that show. And start, just start cracking ideas out. Like
0:42:19.160000 - 0:42:23.680000::Nick, yeah, start coding. Yeah. And I'll say this about the popular kids,
0:42:23.680000 - 0:42:26.760000::one of the most popular kids in my school, addicted to drugs, dead.
0:42:27.040000 - 0:42:31.680000::Wow. Yeah. That's popular. So I mean, I don't know.
0:42:31.920000 - 0:42:36.280000::You are entering enjoy and also enjoy being a kid at the same time because
0:42:36.280000 - 0:42:40.800000::you're about to enter a minefield. And as you grow older, your network begins
0:42:40.800000 - 0:42:44::to grow and you begin to know many more people and guess what?
0:42:44.040000 - 0:42:48.440000::The risk of knowing one of those people who passes away increases tenfold.
0:42:48.440000 - 0:42:51.440000::Right now, maybe your grandma or maybe your grandpa went or maybe
0:42:51.440000 - 0:42:54.280000::tragically someone even younger and closer than that.
0:42:54.280000 - 0:42:57.400000::Maybe you want the truth of the matter is when you get to a certain age,
0:42:57.760000 - 0:43:01.880000::my, my Nana calls me all the time. She's 93. Ask her what she did that day.
0:43:01.960000 - 0:43:06.760000::Always a funeral. Almost always if someone from her church is going,
0:43:06.760000 - 0:43:09.720000::let me tell you just as you get older, that's the risk of making friends is the
0:43:09.720000 - 0:43:11.360000::risk that they might go away. That's right.
0:43:11.400000 - 0:43:14.280000::You realize that now is a child. Every dollar you have is a dollar you might
0:43:14.280000 - 0:43:19.200000::lose gambling and then you don't get to talk to your relatives ever again.
0:43:19.240000 - 0:43:21.280000::Oh, yeah. Let me tell you something about it.
0:43:23.400000 - 0:43:26.560000::Look, the house we're in right now, let me put some respect on it.
0:43:26.640000 - 0:43:27.160000::Yeah.
0:43:27.720000 - 0:43:34.680000::Rhoda, whatever lesson, Rhoda diamond, I think was my grandma's name, a librarian.
0:43:35.680000 - 0:43:38.520000::Short Jewish woman, probably, but literally maybe four foot three.
0:43:42.840000 - 0:43:43.680000::What were we talking about?
0:43:44.680000 - 0:43:47.640000::Just kind of death. Oh, death. Oh, yeah. I caught she called.
0:43:49.200000 - 0:43:52.760000::I need medication. I'm not kidding, but she called me on her.
0:43:52.800000 - 0:43:57.360000::No, I called her on her 96th birthday and she said this,
0:43:59.120000 - 0:44:03.720000::getting old is scary. I don't like it. I'm lonely.
0:44:06.040000 - 0:44:11.600000::And that made me think, you don't need to try and live long, long,
0:44:11.880000 - 0:44:13.720000::live fast, die young.
0:44:14.680000 - 0:44:17.960000::You don't want to be around because at a certain point, yeah, you're going to start
0:44:17.960000 - 0:44:20.640000::knowing death. You're going to start seeing more and more death, but there
0:44:20.640000 - 0:44:24.800000::becomes a time when the weight becomes so heavy, you think you're going to become
0:44:24.800000 - 0:44:30.480000::more and more comfortable with it, but there becomes a time when you fear it
0:44:30.480000 - 0:44:33::more than you ever thought you could imagine. Yeah.
0:44:33.480000 - 0:44:37.520000::And you truly come to terms with oblivion and what that means.
0:44:38.080000 - 0:44:41.320000::Because you've experienced oblivion here. Imagine turning 90 and then you
0:44:41.320000 - 0:44:45.240000::still got 10 more years to go. No, thank you. 10 years.
0:44:45.560000 - 0:44:47.640000::That's middle school four times.
0:44:48.120000 - 0:44:51.080000::And I don't know if you kids have seen these. I've told the story a million times.
0:44:51.080000 - 0:44:56.440000::I went as a child, I sang in nursing homes. Towards the end, it is not a good time.
0:44:56.720000 - 0:44:59.920000::It is, you might as, you might as, it's a

0:45:00 - 0:45:04.280000::The last thing to go out at I would say 85, Paris and Fords, nearly age.
0:45:04.280000 - 0:45:07.040000::Now you don't want to be around forever.
0:45:07.040000 - 0:45:10.760000::Life is short, it's sweet, it's the universe experiencing itself.
0:45:10.760000 - 0:45:13.640000::Wow, that's beautiful.
0:45:13.640000 - 0:45:16.880000::You want to be here for a good time, not a long time, you know what I'm saying?
0:45:16.880000 - 0:45:18.360000::I do know what you're saying.
0:45:18.360000 - 0:45:24.240000::I think that I will be one of the most lonely as old men that's ever existed.
0:45:24.240000 - 0:45:29.120000::You're going to be at the Y kind of like, because you have one resistance on the bike,
0:45:29.120000 - 0:45:30.960000::for like four hours a day.
0:45:30.960000 - 0:45:32.240000::Just cancel those in your muscle.
0:45:32.240000 - 0:45:33.240000::You can feel those in your muscle.
0:45:33.240000 - 0:45:38.120000::And then you're kind of like, just like barely peddling, reading USA today.
0:45:38.120000 - 0:45:40.360000::That's going to be you, dude, and that's because of some joy.
0:45:40.360000 - 0:45:41.360000::Don't point at me, man.
0:45:41.360000 - 0:45:43.280000::Stop pointing at me, stop it.
0:45:43.280000 - 0:45:46.720000::I told you that, to stop doing that.
0:45:46.720000 - 0:45:48.880000::There's got some crazy fingers.
0:45:48.880000 - 0:45:52.040000::You know, before we started this podcast, we really said let's really try to make it for
0:45:52.040000 - 0:45:53.560000::kids for real.
0:45:53.560000 - 0:45:54.560000::And we did.
0:45:54.560000 - 0:45:55.560000::And we did it.
0:45:55.560000 - 0:45:56.560000::We did it again.
0:45:56.560000 - 0:45:58.400000::We did our best job.
0:45:58.400000 - 0:45:59.760000::You can just give us that.
0:45:59.760000 - 0:46:06.960000::We did our best job now because usually we're talking about the craziest, most malicious type
0:46:06.960000 - 0:46:09.080000::of darkest topics on the planet.
0:46:09.080000 - 0:46:13.120000::And this one we kept it pretty much PG 13 rated, right?
0:46:13.120000 - 0:46:14.120000::Oh, yeah.
0:46:14.120000 - 0:46:15.120000::Yeah.
0:46:15.120000 - 0:46:16.360000::Every kid, they're not supposed to see that.
0:46:16.360000 - 0:46:18.600000::They're under the age of 13, but they do.
0:46:18.600000 - 0:46:24.560000::And I was one of those kids that was watching our rated PG 13 stuff when I could make
0:46:24.560000 - 0:46:25.560000::sense.
0:46:25.560000 - 0:46:26.800000::That makes so much sense.
0:46:26.800000 - 0:46:27.800000::Yeah.
0:46:27.800000 - 0:46:32.800000::I kind of like that stuff when I was a kid.
0:46:32.800000 - 0:46:37.520000::How we still have a couple more minutes for a couple more segments for the kids?
0:46:37.520000 - 0:46:38.520000::Yes, we do.
0:46:38.520000 - 0:46:39.520000::Okay.
0:46:39.520000 - 0:46:40.520000::Yes, we do.
0:46:40.520000 - 0:46:43.920000::So why don't we, before we get out of here and say what gave us joy, which you should do
0:46:43.920000 - 0:46:48.160000::every night before bed, as you are telling your parents about joy tactics, etc.
0:46:48.160000 - 0:46:49.160000::Yeah.
0:46:49.160000 - 0:46:52.040000::Is saying a song about everything you learned.
0:46:52.040000 - 0:46:53.040000::Yeah.
0:46:53.040000 - 0:46:57.600000::So first we talked about, all right.
0:46:57.600000 - 0:47:01.560000::So we did something today on joy tactics.
0:47:01.560000 - 0:47:03.080000::That way me learned.
0:47:03.080000 - 0:47:11::I can't believe all the things I learned again from Eric Rahel.
0:47:11 - 0:47:14.680000::Why is the ukulele so cursed from that cancellation video?
0:47:14.680000 - 0:47:15.680000::Oh my god.
0:47:15.680000 - 0:47:16.680000::Oh my god.
0:47:16.680000 - 0:47:17.680000::I feel like the ukulele.
0:47:17.680000 - 0:47:19.480000::You can't frame a people like that.
0:47:19.480000 - 0:47:21.480000::Colleen, see what's your name, Miranda Singh?
0:47:21.480000 - 0:47:22.480000::Yeah.
0:47:22.480000 - 0:47:24.400000::We are way from those type of adults.
0:47:24.400000 - 0:47:30.360000::If you see somebody with a new school run, run, run, run child, run.
0:47:30.360000 - 0:47:31.360000::We are safe.
0:47:31.360000 - 0:47:32.360000::Yeah.
0:47:32.360000 - 0:47:35.720000::Uh, we talked about why is this one the most cursed instrument on the planet?
0:47:35.720000 - 0:47:39.600000::I'll tell you why because racism because people have other than alienated the people from
0:47:39.600000 - 0:47:43.400000::the native people from Hawaii and their instruments and they think that they can just literally
0:47:43.400000 - 0:47:45.400000::other this thing until the ground.
0:47:45.400000 - 0:47:46.400000::But guess what?
0:47:46.400000 - 0:47:48.240000::You can't and we won't stand for it anymore.
0:47:48.240000 - 0:47:49.720000::You colonizing some of a bitch.
0:47:49.720000 - 0:47:51.040000::You fucking piece of shit.
0:47:51.040000 - 0:47:52.280000::I'm going to curse about it.
0:47:52.280000 - 0:47:55.880000::So by the way, kids, you need to curse to express yourself for the love of God.
0:47:55.880000 - 0:47:59.800000::Who is the guy, the big guy, the guy that, you're talking about Israel, come on,
0:47:59.800000 - 0:48:00.800000::come on.
0:48:00.800000 - 0:48:01.800000::Yeah.
0:48:01.800000 - 0:48:02.800000::Of course.
0:48:02.800000 - 0:48:04.760000::The, the, the, the go, the fucking Jimmy Hendrix of the youth.
0:48:04.760000 - 0:48:09.400000::By the way, that's the best funeral I've ever seen on YouTube except for the one where
0:48:09.400000 - 0:48:12.920000::the, well, I can't tell you because Jim Hansen's, if you're a child, I've said this
0:48:12.920000 - 0:48:16.840000::a lot of times, I'll watch Jim Hansen's funeral if you want to get a picture of what a
0:48:16.840000 - 0:48:18.640000::good death looks like.
0:48:18.640000 - 0:48:19.640000::Because there's bad death.
0:48:19.640000 - 0:48:20.640000::Oh, you can die badly.
0:48:20.640000 - 0:48:21.640000::Oh, you can die badly.
0:48:21.800000 - 0:48:27.320000::Oh, you can, most deaths are bad and you're very painful and shocked as one.
0:48:27.320000 - 0:48:28.240000::Oh, let me say this.
0:48:28.240000 - 0:48:31.800000::You think you're going to go out nicely, right, right in a hospital surrounded by all
0:48:31.800000 - 0:48:32.800000::your friends?
0:48:32.800000 - 0:48:35.880000::No, no, you are going out alone.
0:48:35.880000 - 0:48:40.240000::No one is coming with you to where you're going and nobody can tell you what's next.
0:48:40.240000 - 0:48:44.480000::So just be comfortable with yourself because you're your only passenger on that ride.
0:48:44.480000 - 0:48:49.240000::And by the time we're all dying, there's not going to be such thing as death beds anymore.
0:48:49.240000 - 0:48:54.600000::It's going to be just, just hope that it wasn't a grenade because you think it's just
0:48:54.600000 - 0:48:57::you creating Russia.
0:48:57 - 0:49:00.320000::Kids, let me tell you something about hacking.
0:49:00.320000 - 0:49:04.840000::Eventually this AI stuff is going to get so advanced that there's going to be a video that
0:49:04.840000 - 0:49:10.440000::is released of Vladimir Putin being assassinated at which point people are going to question,
0:49:10.440000 - 0:49:11.440000::is it real?
0:49:11.440000 - 0:49:12.440000::Is it real?
0:49:12.440000 - 0:49:13.440000::What's this?
0:49:13.440000 - 0:49:14.440000::What's that?
0:49:14.440000 - 0:49:15.440000::There's some of it.
0:49:15.440000 - 0:49:16.440000::Isn't that?
0:49:16.440000 - 0:49:18.240000::Well, they're going to just say it's real and at that point, it's on.
0:49:18.240000 - 0:49:19.240000::Yeah.
0:49:19.240000 - 0:49:23.120000::They're going to just say if you live in a major city or within a 12 mile radius of a major
0:49:23.120000 - 0:49:32.440000::city, invest in lead walling for the insides of your homes, have water, have vitamins.
0:49:32.440000 - 0:49:37.080000::There's a joy-tactic survival kit that you can buy on a website that's got $30,000.
0:49:37.080000 - 0:49:38.080000::It's got $44,000.
0:49:38.080000 - 0:49:39.080000::It's got $40,000.
0:49:39.080000 - 0:49:40.080000::It's got $40,000.
0:49:40.080000 - 0:49:43.080000::You think that's a heavy price, $40,000?
0:49:43.080000 - 0:49:44.080000::Yeah.
0:49:44.080000 - 0:49:47.080000::What kind of price can you put on the living life?
0:49:47.080000 - 0:49:48.080000::You know what I'm saying?
0:49:48.080000 - 0:49:49.680000::Not that much when you think about it.
0:49:49.680000 - 0:49:54.480000::Yeah, it's some of the most busted mac and cheese sort of mixtures with rice and broccoli
0:49:54.480000 - 0:49:55.480000::and dehydrated beans.
0:49:55.480000 - 0:49:58.480000::We do have to have a heavy cumin.
0:49:58.480000 - 0:49:59.880000::Everything is heavy, heavy, heavy cumin.

0:50:00 - 0:50:01.440000::You got dehydrated water.
0:50:01.440000 - 0:50:02.440000::You never even see it.
0:50:02.440000 - 0:50:03.940000::You can't imagine what that looks like.
0:50:03.940000 - 0:50:05.160000::Looks like fish scales.
0:50:05.160000 - 0:50:07.480000::It's gonna taste so bad, but you know what?
0:50:07.480000 - 0:50:08.880000::That's just the price you pay.
0:50:08.880000 - 0:50:10.360000::You're not gonna be tasting good food.
0:50:10.360000 - 0:50:11.680000::You're not gonna have the pad Thai.
0:50:11.680000 - 0:50:12.520000::But guess what?
0:50:12.520000 - 0:50:13.360000::What?
0:50:13.360000 - 0:50:14.200000::What would you pop a lit kid?
0:50:14.200000 - 0:50:15.200000::Can I say this about food words?
0:50:15.200000 - 0:50:16.040000::Of course.
0:50:16.040000 - 0:50:18.520000::Kids, you might be growing up in a vegan household,
0:50:18.520000 - 0:50:20.440000::in which case you are probably weak
0:50:20.440000 - 0:50:21.520000::and crawling around on the ground,
0:50:21.520000 - 0:50:22.680000::all screw me out.
0:50:22.680000 - 0:50:24.320000::You're all skin and bones.
0:50:24.320000 - 0:50:26.720000::But if you're growing up in a house that eats meat,
0:50:27.680000 - 0:50:29.920000::which is how I grew up,
0:50:29.920000 - 0:50:32.320000::every time you take a bite of meat, this is what I do.
0:50:32.320000 - 0:50:34.080000::Nobody told me to do this.
0:50:34.080000 - 0:50:36.360000::I thank the animal that passed away
0:50:36.360000 - 0:50:39.280000::for the nutrition for the sacrifice.
0:50:39.280000 - 0:50:41.520000::Know that to stay alive,
0:50:41.520000 - 0:50:44.120000::it's counting on other people's sacrifices.
0:50:45.320000 - 0:50:47.440000::The chicken fried chicken sandwich eating right now,
0:50:47.440000 - 0:50:49.320000::that chicken got its head cut off
0:50:49.320000 - 0:50:51.440000::after living in a cage.
0:50:51.440000 - 0:50:52.840000::And we don't think twice about it.
0:50:52.840000 - 0:50:54.320000::You couldn't go kill a chicken, could you?
0:50:54.320000 - 0:50:57.440000::But you'll just as soon go eat its meat.
0:50:57.440000 - 0:50:58.680000::I don't need everybody in here
0:50:58.680000 - 0:51:00.480000::to go be raising chickens and slaughtering them.
0:51:00.480000 - 0:51:02.480000::That's not going to happen.
0:51:02.480000 - 0:51:03.520000::But what I need people to do
0:51:03.520000 - 0:51:05.640000::is understand the gravity of staying alive.
0:51:05.640000 - 0:51:07.520000::To stay alive is to be on top of the food chain,
0:51:07.520000 - 0:51:09.040000::which is to be a predator.
0:51:09.960000 - 0:51:11.920000::So I suggest going on YouTube
0:51:11.920000 - 0:51:13.720000::and kind of looking up some animal deaths,
0:51:13.720000 - 0:51:15.920000::just to kind of, you know.
0:51:15.920000 - 0:51:17.160000::Go on YouTube and look up,
0:51:17.160000 - 0:51:18.960000::making a chicken sandwich from scratch.
0:51:18.960000 - 0:51:20.680000::It takes this person about six months.
0:51:20.680000 - 0:51:21.920000::This is horrible.
0:51:21.920000 - 0:51:24.160000::And when they fucking, when they,
0:51:24.160000 - 0:51:25.200000::when they kill the chicken,
0:51:25.200000 - 0:51:26.360000::cause it has to be done,
0:51:26.360000 - 0:51:27.560000::here's how they do it. Ready?
0:51:27.560000 - 0:51:29.080000::Oh God.
0:51:29.080000 - 0:51:32.320000::They get a chicken, they get a long crowbar.
0:51:32.320000 - 0:51:36.240000::And they put it over the chicken's head net like this.
0:51:36.240000 - 0:51:37.240000::Camera just died.
0:51:38.400000 - 0:51:39.400000::Hold up.
0:51:39.400000 - 0:51:42.480000::Oh, well, well, imagine this.
0:51:42.480000 - 0:51:44.520000::Well, well, imagine.
0:51:45.840000 - 0:51:48.600000::Well, imagine this since the video just died.
0:51:48.600000 - 0:51:52.080000::That there's basically somebody's stepping on your neck
0:51:52.080000 - 0:51:55.200000::with a crowbar and they yank your body up away
0:51:55.200000 - 0:51:58.600000::and they decapitate you with pure, brute strength.
0:51:58.600000 - 0:52:01.160000::And that's probably a nice way to go.
0:52:01.160000 - 0:52:03.960000::Most of them are going to go in the future
0:52:03.960000 - 0:52:06.320000::when they start doing the fingernails wars.

0:54:12.720000 - 0:54:13.640000::My jaw's unhinged.
0:54:13.640000 - 0:54:14.600000::My jaw's unhinged.
0:54:14.600000 - 0:54:18.600000::No, um, what gave me joy?
0:54:18.600000 - 0:54:19.760000::Picking up water.
0:54:19.760000 - 0:54:22.640000::Y'all, I got to do my favorite thing on the planet.
0:54:22.640000 - 0:54:24.760000::The water here has been poisoned intentionally
0:54:24.760000 - 0:54:26.840000::so that people who can't afford water
0:54:26.840000 - 0:54:28.800000::aren't allowed to come to Martha's Vineyard.
0:54:28.800000 - 0:54:32.240000::Yeah, because there's an extreme class war going on here.
0:54:32.240000 - 0:54:33.800000::You think it's all Democrats and liberals?
0:54:33.800000 - 0:54:35.680000::You don't drink any Kittap water, by the way.
0:54:35.680000 - 0:54:36.680000::It's all poison.
0:54:36.680000 - 0:54:38.360000::Everything is poison around you.
0:54:38.360000 - 0:54:42.400000::Drinking tap water is worse than drinking cyanide.
0:54:42.400000 - 0:54:44.480000::But going to the water store was really fun.
0:54:44.480000 - 0:54:46.880000::Getting to put the jugs of water into the car
0:54:46.880000 - 0:54:48.520000::and then drive them home.
0:54:48.520000 - 0:54:51.280000::These are the types of tasks that I was put on this planet
0:54:51.280000 - 0:54:52.040000::to do.
0:54:52.040000 - 0:54:54.880000::So it felt really good to be a mule.
0:54:54.880000 - 0:54:56.520000::That's what gave me joy.
0:54:56.520000 - 0:54:59.040000::Smack Eric.

0:55:13.320000 - 0:55:23.020000::Cone in that hard cherry shell with some sprinkles at the bottom that made me so joyful and by the way when you get that soft serve kids
0:55:23.020000 - 0:55:25.020000::Don't be afraid to ask for a cup
0:55:25.220000 - 0:55:31.580000::Because the soft serve is gonna melt it's gonna go down on your hands and it's gonna make you regret having the treat
0:55:31.660000 - 0:55:36.940000::So just be safe use a cup and use a spoon and you can ask for the cone turned upside down
0:55:36.940000 - 0:55:43.200000::So that's what I'd say that's my advice have fun being a kid. It's not gonna last for long some of you won't make it to adulthood
