0:00:30.080000 - 0:00:35.680000::been avoiding talking about for a very long time. Even though we've been to Atlantic City and talked about it.
0:00:36.880000 - 0:00:42.400000::Oh, we should have had a game. We should have had a gambling, a gambling bet that you could make on the
0:00:42.400000 - 0:00:47.440000::Joy Tactics this episode. Okay, that's a good one. Right. So, yeah. We got a certain percentage.
0:00:47.440000 - 0:00:55.200000::Yeah, yeah. Cut off the top of every bet plays just for facilitating. This is how a businessman thinks.
0:00:55.200000 - 0:01:04.240000::Okay. Not a gambling man, a businessman. Oh, no, because the best casino owners never touch their
0:01:04.240000 - 0:01:10.080000::own get high off their own supply. They get high off of business deals, not off of roulette. Okay.
0:01:11.280000 - 0:01:15.840000::I'm a gambling. I'm not a gambling man. I'm gambling man. See what I'm saying?
0:01:16.800000 - 0:01:26.880000::Wow, I'm not a businessman. I'm a business sir. Wow. So let's talk about maybe let's let's get everybody in on this.
0:01:28.320000 - 0:01:35.680000::How did this come about? Why is it relevant to speak on? Is it because life is a gamble?
0:01:35.680000 - 0:01:43.200000::Is it because you won the lottery by being the correct semen molecule? No, it's because of by the way you all did.
0:01:43.200000 - 0:01:50.080000::Well, everybody listening won that damn lottery. The consciousness lottery. Some of them.
0:01:50.080000 - 0:01:57.840000::Some of the molecules ended up as worms and even as trees and dandelions. So you better count your lucky stars that you can.
0:01:57.840000 - 0:02:07.200000::Huh? You're saying that I'm saying. Semen molecules. I don't think that's a semen couldn't turn into a worm dude. Oh, you're saying.
0:02:07.200000 - 0:02:14.400000::No, once consciousness. Wow. Once again, once again, I'm about four steps ahead of you guys. No, I'm talking about all molecules.
0:02:16 - 0:02:22.080000::So what people don't talk about is this is very interesting. Yeah. What people don't talk about is right.
0:02:22.080000 - 0:02:27.360000::Winning the sperm lottery of getting out the nuts. But what comes before that? And I apologize for speaking
0:02:27.360000 - 0:02:33.360000::briefly. Well, it comes before that is the molecule of consciousness going into the even into that. Correct.
0:02:33.760000 - 0:02:39.040000::Pool. So there's even getting into that nut pool. That's right. I know.
0:02:39.040000 - 0:02:43.520000::To get into the nut pool from the cosmic pool is already. That's right. Exactly.
0:02:43.520000 - 0:02:52::So you think there's a button in the pre kind of primordial like a sort of ethos of heaven, whatever
0:02:52 - 0:02:57.460000::exists before this life, we are just balls of consciousness. We press a button.
0:02:57.460000 - 0:03:01.960000::Mosquito, and they're like. Are you kidding me dude? That's right. Are you.
0:03:01.960000 - 0:03:06.700000::Spurm and then you're like, Oh shit, I might have a chance. I might have a chance.
0:03:06.700000 - 0:03:11.920000::Yeah. Fucking five million sperm sperm sperm.
0:03:13.200000 - 0:03:19.040000::Looking pelican. Oh, no, no, no, go again. Not a pelican. No, you don't want to be.
0:03:19.040000 - 0:03:23.920000::Oh, but I bet I bet pelicans pretty high up on the fucking list.
0:03:24.600000 - 0:03:28.520000::You know what I mean? Because what you could be a rock. And if you're a rock, bro,
0:03:28.520000 - 0:03:32.640000::oh, yeah, bro, bro, rocks don't have consciousness, dude.
0:03:33.400000 - 0:03:36.520000::I believe that we are inferred to be careful.
0:03:37.080000 - 0:03:41.760000::Careful, dude. You need you need to be careful about this. All matters, consciousness.
0:03:42.080000 - 0:03:45.840000::You know what I mean? All the very rise. This is conscious, right?
0:03:46.200000 - 0:03:51.160000::Well, everything is all molecules of the universe experiencing itself.
0:03:51.720000 - 0:03:54.360000::Of course, looking at itself in the mirror, checking itself out.
0:03:54.360000 - 0:03:59.160000::The second carl second, Carl's second.
0:03:59.160000 - 0:04:03::That right. He's very smart. I've said that too before he's went.
0:04:03.720000 - 0:04:09::But what I'm saying is, no, I got this. I got this. This is crucial. Come on.
0:04:09 - 0:04:10.520000::What was it? What was it? Dig dig.
0:04:11.680000 - 0:04:12.680000::Please keep going.
0:04:12.680000 - 0:04:16.160000::Dude, push this podcast. People are saying it's slipping.
0:04:16.160000 - 0:04:19.760000::The no, no, no, it's not slipping. The slip up is slip back for his leg.
0:04:24.600000 - 0:04:27.800000::I'm so sad about this man. It was a pretty fun one to talk.
0:04:27.800000 - 0:04:30.080000::A slip up is a setup for a slip back.
0:04:30.600000 - 0:04:34.200000::A slip up is a slip up is a slip back for a slip.
0:04:34.480000 - 0:04:40.680000::So slipping on him. All right. So what I'm saying, click, can we do it where we recap what we just said 12 seconds ago?
0:04:41.640000 - 0:04:48.080000::Yeah, we were talking about the gambling and then we talked about the ultimate gamble, which is the consciousness lottery and how we are all.
0:04:48.080000 - 0:04:50.960000::I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I'm sorry to scream.
0:04:50.960000 - 0:04:54.320000::Okay. But I just remembered what my question was for you guys.
0:04:55.120000 - 0:04:56.520000::Yes, please.
0:04:56.760000 - 0:04:59::Fuck is a rock.
0:04:59.640000 - 0:05:00::Cause when people say,

0:05:00 - 0:05:03.840000::People say rock does clay kind of a rock.
0:05:03.840000 - 0:05:06.040000::Does granite kind of a rock like when I see a rock
0:05:06.040000 - 0:05:07::like what the fuck is that?
0:05:07 - 0:05:07.840000::You know what I'm saying?
0:05:07.840000 - 0:05:09.440000::What is that is rock?
0:05:09.440000 - 0:05:13.280000::Well, all right, how do I break this down for you dude?
0:05:13.280000 - 0:05:16.560000::You know what a mineral is right?
0:05:16.560000 - 0:05:18.560000::Yeah, I put them in my amino water why?
0:05:18.560000 - 0:05:21.080000::And Eric, I wanna apologize to you real quick
0:05:21.080000 - 0:05:25.360000::because I once saw you reading a fifth grade geology book
0:05:25.360000 - 0:05:27.520000::and I said how is this ever gonna pay off?
0:05:28.320000 - 0:05:31.720000::For you, I don't understand why you're reading this
0:05:31.720000 - 0:05:35.080000::and why you're studying this and it's just like,
0:05:35.080000 - 0:05:37.240000::but I just wanna formally apologize you
0:05:37.240000 - 0:05:40.360000::because I know what you're about to say is gonna really,
0:05:40.360000 - 0:05:42.760000::you know, pay off your studies have been paying off.
0:05:42.760000 - 0:05:43.760000::Just look back.
0:05:44.760000 - 0:05:48::Buying like a red flyer wagon full of like fifth grade books
0:05:48 - 0:05:51.360000::and like just studying, highlighting them all
0:05:51.360000 - 0:05:53.480000::like really grinding, just learning.
0:05:54.800000 - 0:05:57.040000::And oh wait, I just wanna say this about consciousness
0:05:57.160000 - 0:06:00.120000::and there's a bug that I almost just squished.
0:06:01.080000 - 0:06:02.400000::It's walking right towards my laptop,
0:06:02.400000 - 0:06:04.040000::I don't want it to go into the infrastructure
0:06:04.040000 - 0:06:07.320000::with the microchips, but I don't wanna kill it
0:06:07.320000 - 0:06:09.880000::after this conversation because Lord knows
0:06:09.880000 - 0:06:11.600000::his bugs are only around for so long.
0:06:11.600000 - 0:06:15.920000::This molecule could have waited 400 million years
0:06:15.920000 - 0:06:19.960000::and that's by the way, baby, baby ship for the universe
0:06:19.960000 - 0:06:20.960000::to become that bug.
0:06:20.960000 - 0:06:24.080000::So I'm not fucking ending that life, let the bugs live.
0:06:24.080000 - 0:06:29.080000::But rocks, okay, so minerals, basically coalesce
0:06:30.840000 - 0:06:35.160000::and different types of minerals will then form something
0:06:35.160000 - 0:06:36::called our rock.
0:06:36 - 0:06:37.520000::Don't bullshit with me right now.
0:06:37.520000 - 0:06:39.640000::Let me give you guys a say you don't know.
0:06:39.640000 - 0:06:42.040000::Let me say a couple words right now.
0:06:42.040000 - 0:06:47.040000::Sedimentary, metamorphic, Ignatius, Ignatius.
0:06:47.720000 - 0:06:49::That's the one for Kenne.
0:06:49 - 0:06:53.760000::That's all fucking addicts has for me.
0:06:53.760000 - 0:06:55.280000::Sedimentary rocks.
0:06:55.280000 - 0:06:57.080000::Sedimentary rocks.
0:06:57.080000 - 0:07:00.120000::Sedimentary rocks are the rocks that are
0:07:01.360000 - 0:07:06.040000::a coagulation of sand and dirt, basically.
0:07:06.040000 - 0:07:07.680000::If I could put it into a simple terms
0:07:07.680000 - 0:07:09.360000::for the layman's out there.
0:07:09.360000 - 0:07:12.960000::Now I could go into the deep molecular,
0:07:12.960000 - 0:07:14.920000::geometric structures of these objects,
0:07:14.920000 - 0:07:16.080000::but I'm not going to.
0:07:16.080000 - 0:07:19.200000::Of course, we all could, but it's just like
0:07:19.200000 - 0:07:22.680000::for the sake of the podcast, let's just keep it high level.
0:07:22.760000 - 0:07:25.720000::So let's get back to the topic again.
0:07:25.720000 - 0:07:27.080000::So what we're discussing.
0:07:27.080000 - 0:07:28.120000::Gambleing.
0:07:28.120000 - 0:07:29.600000::Gambleing.
0:07:29.600000 - 0:07:33.200000::G-A-M-B-L-I-N-G is because Nate and I just
0:07:33.200000 - 0:07:34.880000::did some of that financially.
0:07:35.720000 - 0:07:37.600000::And this is a very good strategy.
0:07:37.600000 - 0:07:40.240000::So if you live in Pennsylvania,
0:07:41.840000 - 0:07:43.640000::Pennsylvania, West Virginia, New Jersey,
0:07:43.640000 - 0:07:45.280000::Connecticut, or Michigan,
0:07:45.280000 - 0:07:50.080000::you have the ability to play Blackjack and Casino games
0:07:50.080000 - 0:07:52.200000::and slot machines on your phone right now.
0:07:53.320000 - 0:07:55.440000::Oh, and I'm just learning this is a perfect chance
0:07:55.440000 - 0:07:57.800000::for me to get a referral code.
0:07:57.800000 - 0:08:00.440000::So to use my drag kings, Nate.
0:08:00.440000 - 0:08:01.600000::I'll put it right there.
0:08:01.600000 - 0:08:02.600000::Just get it.
0:08:02.600000 - 0:08:03.440000::Because that's what happened.
0:08:03.440000 - 0:08:07.280000::Jack gave me his drag kings referral.
0:08:07.280000 - 0:08:11.880000::And I got 100 bucks just to, once I put in five.
0:08:11.880000 - 0:08:14.400000::And dude, I just got basically like 100,
0:08:14.400000 - 0:08:16.680000::I'm up to 117 bucks.
0:08:16.680000 - 0:08:17.480000::Basically free money.
0:08:17.480000 - 0:08:19.480000::It's literally free money, dude.
0:08:19.480000 - 0:08:20.480000::And there's no down to it.
0:08:20.480000 - 0:08:24.680000::South, it will never turn into an addiction ever.
0:08:24.680000 - 0:08:25.360000::No, it couldn't.
0:08:25.360000 - 0:08:26.280000::If you do it this way.
0:08:26.280000 - 0:08:27.840000::And what we did on top of that is,
0:08:27.840000 - 0:08:30.120000::so we said, okay, we're going to Philadelphia.
0:08:31.680000 - 0:08:35::We do, okay, let's get breakfast.
0:08:35 - 0:08:39.280000::Oh shit, I spent $18 on breakfast at Starbucks
0:08:39.280000 - 0:08:40.480000::and getting hands in the bathroom.
0:08:40.480000 - 0:08:42.040000::That's nothing.
0:08:42.040000 - 0:08:42.880000::Okay, guess what?
0:08:42.880000 - 0:08:43.720000::That's nothing.
0:08:43.720000 - 0:08:45.720000::Hit the Blackjack, make it back.
0:08:45.720000 - 0:08:46.560000::Okay, what's for lunch?
0:08:46.560000 - 0:08:48.160000::Be them Bob, 20 bucks.

0:08:50.600000 - 0:08:52.280000::Okay, 20 bucks.
0:08:52.280000 - 0:08:53.480000::Boom, we're eating.
0:08:53.480000 - 0:08:54.320000::Okay, what do you want to do?
0:08:54.320000 - 0:08:55.480000::Go on the roller ring.

0:09:03.160000 - 0:09:04.600000::Draft kings.
0:09:04.600000 - 0:09:05.440000::Draft kings.
0:09:05.440000 - 0:09:06.280000::It is a fun thing.
0:09:06.280000 - 0:09:07.120000::It is a fun thing.
0:09:07.120000 - 0:09:08.920000::I'm trying to beat you guys with a punch for it.
0:09:08.920000 - 0:09:10.360000::Can you do it in the Cali?
0:09:10.360000 - 0:09:11.200000::Is it?
0:09:11.200000 - 0:09:14.040000::I know you can do sports, but can you do like the Blackjack shit?

0:09:30.440000 - 0:09:32.120000::It's that simple.
0:09:32.120000 - 0:09:34.680000::I'm just saying like if you're in one of those states,
0:09:34.680000 - 0:09:37.360000::like just do the get, so you know somebody
0:09:37.360000 - 0:09:39.040000::who's a fucking addicted to gambling,

0:09:42.880000 - 0:09:44.760000::All you gotta do is put five bucks in.
0:09:44.760000 - 0:09:46.760000::Okay, so Nate, let me ask you this.
0:09:46.760000 - 0:09:49.600000::How much more fun was I to hang out with
0:09:49.600000 - 0:09:51.560000::when you could do nothing to get me?
0:09:51.560000 - 0:09:53.400000::I basically didn't even see you.
0:09:55.480000 - 0:09:59.040000::It was like talking to a wall, you know, like it was so,

0:10:00 - 0:10:04.200000::It was like I was not when we were when Jack and I were in Philly.
0:10:05.400000 - 0:10:10.080000::We had to we about a, you know, what month ago now we had it.
0:10:10.080000 - 0:10:11.040000::We did our show.
0:10:11.040000 - 0:10:12.120000::We went to the casino.
0:10:12.120000 - 0:10:14.400000::We still had to drive back to New York that night.
0:10:14.920000 - 0:10:19.520000::It was getting close to midnight to two hour drive back.
0:10:19.840000 - 0:10:22.080000::And I was saying, we had spent about an hour at the casino.
0:10:22.080000 - 0:10:23.080000::I'm saying, Jack, come on.
0:10:23.080000 - 0:10:23.760000::Let's go man.
0:10:24.760000 - 0:10:25.320000::White night.
0:10:25.320000 - 0:10:27.320000::He's white, not going to fucking real.
0:10:27.320000 - 0:10:27.920000::Table.
0:10:28.400000 - 0:10:33.040000::What you don't realize while close you are something while you're down.
0:10:33.320000 - 0:10:34.520000::That's the only way to lose.
0:10:34.520000 - 0:10:36.840000::There are people who use the gambling or people who quit.
0:10:37.240000 - 0:10:37.840000::Okay.
0:10:37.840000 - 0:10:39::You're still in the running.
0:10:39.240000 - 0:10:39.960000::What do they say?
0:10:40.160000 - 0:10:40.480000::Yeah.
0:10:40.480000 - 0:10:45.320000::So when you, when it's just feel so foolish to ever leave a casino when I'm looking at these machines,
0:10:45.320000 - 0:10:49.160000::especially slot machines and I'm analyzing, oh, this is what the mini is.
0:10:49.360000 - 0:10:50.800000::This is what the major is, right?
0:10:50.800000 - 0:10:51.680000::These are the bonuses.
0:10:51.760000 - 0:10:52.200000::Yeah.
0:10:52.200000 - 0:10:53.200000::This one's about to pop.
0:10:53.200000 - 0:10:54.280000::I can see it right now.
0:10:54.280000 - 0:10:54.840000::Oh my God.
0:10:54.840000 - 0:10:56.920000::I'm pushing people out of the way trying to get in here.
0:10:57.160000 - 0:11:01::I'm using all my limbs and like different extenders to like try and hit multiple machines
0:11:01 - 0:11:02.480000::at once and just spin, spin, spin.
0:11:03.200000 - 0:11:05.200000::This is what I've, this is what I've noticed.
0:11:05.200000 - 0:11:07.400000::And I'm going to do this, I'm going to do this right now.
0:11:07.400000 - 0:11:10.760000::I'm going to, I'm going to ask you a question, Jack, and you're going to prove my theory.
0:11:11.240000 - 0:11:11.840000::Correct.
0:11:11.920000 - 0:11:12.800000::And I know you are.
0:11:13.200000 - 0:11:14.400000::I'm going to ask you this question.
0:11:14.400000 - 0:11:17.880000::And all you have to do is simply answer the question.
0:11:18.120000 - 0:11:19.720000::Tell us, will you do what I mean to fuck with you?
0:11:20.080000 - 0:11:23.880000::No, you just have to, you just have to, whatever your, wherever your brain goes to,
0:11:24.360000 - 0:11:25.880000::I don't want to ask you this question.
0:11:25.880000 - 0:11:26.600000::Feel powerless.
0:11:26.680000 - 0:11:31.040000::You have to just answer whatever you, your brain tells you to say, okay?
0:11:32.120000 - 0:11:38.680000::So I'm going to ask you over the course of your life, how much are you up or down just
0:11:38.680000 - 0:11:48.160000::in terms of gambling for, um, it's tough to calculate just how far into the green I am.
0:11:48.520000 - 0:11:50.720000::But so this is, so you just proved my theory.
0:11:50.720000 - 0:11:51.200000::Correct.
0:11:51.560000 - 0:11:56.560000::Everybody, everybody who gambles is like, like,
0:11:56.600000 - 0:11:59.080000::gambles regularly is just down.
0:11:59.280000 - 0:12:00.240000::It's just down.
0:12:00.240000 - 0:12:01.120000::Just just hold on.
0:12:01.120000 - 0:12:01.640000::A lot.
0:12:01.920000 - 0:12:02.960000::They're all down.
0:12:03.040000 - 0:12:07.760000::And immediately when you ask this question, they pivot and they say, well,
0:12:07.800000 - 0:12:12.800000::I was actually up like, no, you're fucking down 11 grand and just say it.
0:12:13.200000 - 0:12:17.240000::And they can't, they, they just say like, well, last week, guys, what's funny is,
0:12:17.440000 - 0:12:19.280000::I actually, I'm a living grand 10 bucks.
0:12:19.280000 - 0:12:20.440000::That's the first thing they say.
0:12:20.480000 - 0:12:21.480000::And then I have to pry them.
0:12:21.640000 - 0:12:26.560000::No, no, no, no, no, I asked you over the course of your life, how much are you up or down?
0:12:26.760000 - 0:12:27.080000::All right.
0:12:27.080000 - 0:12:30.520000::Let me really go through every single one where this is they are.
0:12:30.520000 - 0:12:34.440000::And you don't have to answer the question by the way I'm ahead and screaming about gambling.
0:12:34.960000 - 0:12:40::If you take out, get rid of the 500 followers that I lost on an anti-Gloom barbuda website.
0:12:40.400000 - 0:12:40.520000::Okay.
0:12:40.520000 - 0:12:44.600000::That doesn't get rid of the other $500 that I lost when I had a panic.
0:12:44.600000 - 0:12:46.200000::You'll just never get a straight answer.
0:12:46.200000 - 0:12:49.280000::I went to a Costa Rica and I went to a casino by myself in Maryland.
0:12:49.560000 - 0:12:50.520000::I lost $500 there.
0:12:50.600000 - 0:12:52.840000::That one doesn't count either because it was a mental health crisis.
0:12:53.160000 - 0:12:53.640000::Okay.
0:12:53.840000 - 0:12:54.440000::Now, right.
0:12:54.640000 - 0:12:55::Right.
0:12:55.040000 - 0:12:56.160000::That one doesn't count.
0:12:56.160000 - 0:12:57.880000::So take away a G off of that right away.
0:12:58.720000 - 0:13:06.960000::Now factor in Eric was the us when we went to we both we went up about $40 and Atlantic City with
0:13:06.960000 - 0:13:10.560000::where when wow, that was early days.
0:13:10.560000 - 0:13:11.280000::Okay.
0:13:11.480000 - 0:13:13.560000::That's I'm taking it all the way back.
0:13:13.640000 - 0:13:14.160000::Okay.
0:13:14.280000 - 0:13:20.120000::Now let's think about now let's forget everything that's happened between then and yesterday.
0:13:20.920000 - 0:13:22.880000::How much did we go up yesterday?
0:13:23.080000 - 0:13:24.760000::You $115.
0:13:24.760000 - 0:13:25.760000::Me $120.
0:13:25.760000 - 0:13:27.160000::You're asking me that same question.
0:13:27.640000 - 0:13:28.960000::Eric, you asked me this question.
0:13:29.280000 - 0:13:30.360000::The same question I asked.
0:13:30.960000 - 0:13:37.040000::How how much are you up or down in your lifetime of gamble down about $500 total?
0:13:37.240000 - 0:13:37.960000::That's not nothing.
0:13:37.960000 - 0:13:38.560000::That's nothing.
0:13:40.680000 - 0:13:41.840000::You're down $500.
0:13:41.840000 - 0:13:42.360000::Wow.
0:13:42.360000 - 0:13:44.280000::But I just $500 is nothing.
0:13:44.280000 - 0:13:45.640000::Did you just hear that folks?
0:13:47.520000 - 0:13:49.560000::Dude, Nate, you realize that you are scarce.
0:13:49.720000 - 0:13:50.240000::Wait.
0:13:50.480000 - 0:13:52.680000::Nate, you realize your scarcity mindset, right?
0:13:53.320000 - 0:13:54.880000::You're a clearly scarcity mindset.
0:13:54.880000 - 0:13:58.080000::And I feel what is this topic?
0:13:58.280000 - 0:14:01.360000::Bro, it's scarcity versus abundance mindset.
0:14:01.360000 - 0:14:07.920000::So if you're scarcity mindset, it means that it means that you live your life thinking
0:14:07.920000 - 0:14:08.800000::nothing else is coming.
0:14:08.800000 - 0:14:09.640000::Let's hoard everything.
0:14:09.640000 - 0:14:10.680000::Hold on to what you have.
0:14:10.920000 - 0:14:13.200000::And if someone else gets this thing, that means I can't have it.
0:14:13.640000 - 0:14:14.920000::There's not enough to go around.
0:14:15 - 0:14:16.960000::That's how fucking losers think, dude.
0:14:17.360000 - 0:14:17.840000::Okay.
0:14:17.840000 - 0:14:20.480000::Abundance mindset is I didn't get this one.
0:14:20.520000 - 0:14:21.600000::There's another one out there.
0:14:21.640000 - 0:14:23.040000::This is a big world.
0:14:23.240000 - 0:14:24.040000::Let's keep going.
0:14:24.040000 - 0:14:24.760000::Let's find that.
0:14:25.880000 - 0:14:31::So you're saying here that an abundance mindset is going to the grove and getting
0:14:31 - 0:14:33::Ray Bans and a
0:14:33.680000 - 0:14:34.200000::band.
0:14:34.880000 - 0:14:35.640000::Be very careful.
0:14:35.840000 - 0:14:36.440000::Yes.
0:14:36.840000 - 0:14:37.440000::Yes.
0:14:37.920000 - 0:14:38.520000::It is.
0:14:38.520000 - 0:14:40.120000::That made me laugh so hard.
0:14:40.120000 - 0:14:40.680000::You're, you're
0:14:40.680000 - 0:14:43.920000::there's nothing wrong with getting Ray Bans.
0:14:44.240000 - 0:14:44.760000::Okay.
0:14:46.120000 - 0:14:49.120000::There's nothing wrong with getting Ray Bans that don't fit your face.
0:14:49.400000 - 0:14:52.920000::That's a common and list like there's a suggestion.
0:14:52.920000 - 0:14:59.160000::When I think there's not like a brand that is funny for you to like real
0:14:59.160000 - 0:15:00::realistically purchase.

0:15:00 - 0:15:05::but also funny to, you know, like, it's just endless.
0:15:05.460000 - 0:15:08.800000::Like, you thinking getting right vans is sick is like,
0:15:08.800000 - 0:15:10.840000::it's like something you actually bought,
0:15:10.840000 - 0:15:15.840000::but also like, you're like as your online persona,
0:15:15.960000 - 0:15:18.280000::like, you're, you know, where does it,
0:15:18.280000 - 0:15:20.040000::where does reality start and where,
0:15:20.040000 - 0:15:21.280000::that's a great interview question.
0:15:21.280000 - 0:15:25.800000::Where does it, because this is leading into your persona
0:15:25.800000 - 0:15:29::and where does it end, when does it start?
0:15:29 - 0:15:31.240000::The only person that I'm going to answer that question
0:15:31.240000 - 0:15:32.480000::for is Sean Evans.
0:15:32.480000 - 0:15:34::And so you guys are gonna be like,
0:15:34 - 0:15:36::you're gonna be like, yeah.
0:15:36 - 0:15:37.720000::Okay.
0:15:37.720000 - 0:15:40.640000::In about eight years, I'll be answering that after
0:15:40.640000 - 0:15:44::downing the bomb with no, no reaction.
0:15:44 - 0:15:47.840000::But for real, I did take that,
0:15:47.840000 - 0:15:52.840000::I first was in that, have like, yeah, seizure,
0:15:54.240000 - 0:15:55.160000::that's not funny.
0:15:55.160000 - 0:15:56::Hot ones.
0:15:56 - 0:15:57.200000::But what is your grove review?
0:15:57.200000 - 0:15:58.200000::You're at the grove, right?
0:15:58.200000 - 0:16:02.040000::No, I was at the grove, yes.
0:16:02.040000 - 0:16:03.200000::You're choking us.
0:16:03.200000 - 0:16:04.800000::It's great.
0:16:04.800000 - 0:16:06.480000::Yeah, I'm getting a little emotional about it.
0:16:06.480000 - 0:16:07.720000::I'm not kidding you.
0:16:07.720000 - 0:16:10.120000::You know, Jack, Jack's been to my hometown mall,
0:16:10.120000 - 0:16:11.360000::Alderwood Mall.
0:16:11.360000 - 0:16:12.680000::And when I was a kid, I was like,
0:16:12.680000 - 0:16:15.280000::this is where everybody likes to fucking chill.
0:16:15.280000 - 0:16:16.800000::And people are so happy here.
0:16:16.800000 - 0:16:18.800000::And they have the outdoor seating
0:16:18.800000 - 0:16:20.520000::and little fire places and shit.
0:16:20.520000 - 0:16:23.320000::And everybody's drinking mojitos and.
0:16:23.320000 - 0:16:24.160000::Did we go there?
0:16:24.160000 - 0:16:25.240000::Apatizers.
0:16:25.240000 - 0:16:27.960000::Yeah, we went to the Alderwood Mall to buy hats.
0:16:28.800000 - 0:16:29.400000::Oh, I remember I remember.
0:16:29.400000 - 0:16:30.240000::Buy hats.
0:16:30.240000 - 0:16:31.080000::Real quick.
0:16:31.080000 - 0:16:32.960000::But real quick, just,
0:16:34.560000 - 0:16:38.560000::people are talking about your like Seattle accent
0:16:38.560000 - 0:16:40.400000::in the comments.
0:16:40.400000 - 0:16:43.600000::And is this because I've noticed that you say,
0:16:43.600000 - 0:16:45.840000::happy instead of happy.
0:16:45.840000 - 0:16:46.680000::What's that?
0:16:46.680000 - 0:16:50.880000::A is happy a Pacific Northwest thing,
0:16:50.880000 - 0:16:54.720000::like putting an E affectation on A's.

0:23:49.040000 - 0:23:50.520000::She looks like she's a very good girl.
0:23:50.520000 - 0:23:51.120000::I really enjoyed the car.
0:23:51.120000 - 0:23:52.120000::The intern.
0:23:52.120000 - 0:23:53.920000::You know the movie, The Intern?
0:23:53.920000 - 0:23:54.800000::Yeah, of course I do.
0:23:54.800000 - 0:23:59.640000::This is where Robert De Niro, who's much older,
0:23:59.640000 - 0:24:03.040000::becomes actually her intern.
0:24:03.040000 - 0:24:03.920000::And he's old.
0:24:03.920000 - 0:24:05.320000::I'm going to probably watch that today.
0:24:05.320000 - 0:24:07.320000::I got some time.
0:24:07.320000 - 0:24:10.280000::Not even being ironic about this.
0:24:10.280000 - 0:24:12.760000::I really thought that movie was sweet.
0:24:12.760000 - 0:24:15.080000::OK?
0:24:15.080000 - 0:24:15.880000::That's OK.
0:24:17.680000 - 0:24:19.360000::But back to gambling, man.
0:24:19.360000 - 0:24:23.400000::We're obviously dodging it because it's hurt people close to us.
0:24:23.400000 - 0:24:24.600000::Oh, can I bring some back up then?
0:24:24.600000 - 0:24:25.960000::But we have to not shy away from it.
0:24:25.960000 - 0:24:26.480000::Please.
0:24:26.480000 - 0:24:31.720000::So just to get back to Nate's unfortunate, I don't know what to call it,
0:24:31.720000 - 0:24:33.080000::but it's fucking annoying.
0:24:33.080000 - 0:24:35.960000::But basically, you're saying gambling's bad, right?
0:24:35.960000 - 0:24:36.640000::Don't do it.
0:24:36.640000 - 0:24:37.440000::I did not.
0:24:37.440000 - 0:24:39.080000::Don't put fucking words in my mouth, man.
0:24:39.080000 - 0:24:40.120000::That's what you said, bitch.
0:24:40.120000 - 0:24:41.080000::And you're in person now.
0:24:41.080000 - 0:24:42.680000::So don't you dare talk shit about me.
0:24:42.680000 - 0:24:43.200000::OK.
0:24:43.200000 - 0:24:43.680000::That's right.
0:24:43.680000 - 0:24:45.360000::This is the first time me and I know what.
0:24:45.360000 - 0:24:48.160000::So what I'm saying is if we had gone to Philadelphia
0:24:48.160000 - 0:24:53.800000::with Nate's scary city mindset, we would have had to pay for lunch.
0:24:53.800000 - 0:24:55.840000::We would have had to pay for the train tickets.
0:24:55.840000 - 0:24:58.520000::We would have had to play for roller skating.
0:24:58.520000 - 0:25:00.200000::Amazing.

0:25:00 - 0:25:01.700000::And guess what?
0:25:01.700000 - 0:25:05::Because we went with my abundance mindset,
0:25:05 - 0:25:08.940000::my gambling, why else are you alive if not to risk,
0:25:08.940000 - 0:25:12.800000::you know, take risks, right?
0:25:13.820000 - 0:25:14.940000::So you're gonna fit them.
0:25:14.940000 - 0:25:16.120000::So this is what I'm saying.
0:25:16.120000 - 0:25:18.320000::Don't you realize what a fool you sound like
0:25:18.320000 - 0:25:19.880000::when you say, how much have you made
0:25:19.880000 - 0:25:21.400000::and lost of your whole life?
0:25:21.400000 - 0:25:25.040000::How much have you loved in your whole life?
0:25:25.040000 - 0:25:25.880000::Wow.
0:25:25.880000 - 0:25:27.440000::Do them saying, oh I'm too afraid.
0:25:27.440000 - 0:25:28.920000::Let me tell you this, Nate.
0:25:31.680000 - 0:25:33.400000::Yeah.
0:25:33.400000 - 0:25:34.800000::Oh, I thought the sound cut out.
0:25:34.800000 - 0:25:35.800000::Let me tell you this.
0:25:35.800000 - 0:25:37.440000::I fully was like this.
0:25:39.440000 - 0:25:42::You know what they tell soldiers going into battle
0:25:42 - 0:25:43.360000::to ease their nerves.
0:25:43.360000 - 0:25:44.600000::I'm just here.
0:25:44.600000 - 0:25:45.600000::Do you know about this?
0:25:45.600000 - 0:25:46.440000::What?
0:25:46.440000 - 0:25:49.480000::They say that the bullet that is going to kill you
0:25:49.480000 - 0:25:52.640000::has had, it's had his head, your name written on it
0:25:52.640000 - 0:25:54.920000::since the day you were born.
0:25:54.920000 - 0:25:58.240000::You cannot stop what's gonna happen.
0:25:58.240000 - 0:26:01.360000::So put the pedal in the middle.
0:26:01.360000 - 0:26:02.760000::Try something out in life
0:26:02.760000 - 0:26:05.280000::because see that bullet's gonna kill you anyways.
0:26:05.280000 - 0:26:06.280000::You know what I mean?
0:26:06.280000 - 0:26:08.360000::You might as well just take some risks
0:26:08.360000 - 0:26:09.520000::and see what happens.
0:26:09.520000 - 0:26:11.040000::See if it don't help a little.
0:26:14 - 0:26:15.480000::Wow.
0:26:15.480000 - 0:26:16.520000::I see it sitting you guys.
0:26:16.520000 - 0:26:20.520000::Well, can I, can I, I just need to process all this
0:26:20.520000 - 0:26:23.120000::and I'm gonna take my time to process this
0:26:23.120000 - 0:26:26.360000::because decisions and lifestyle choices aren't made
0:26:26.360000 - 0:26:28.800000::in a second overnight, they take time.
0:26:28.800000 - 0:26:31.880000::They take days, weeks, months, years, decades.
0:26:31.880000 - 0:26:34.200000::So yeah, I might not be able to use the,
0:26:36.520000 - 0:26:37.360000::what did you just say?
0:26:37.360000 - 0:26:38.200000::It's like again.
0:26:39.840000 - 0:26:41.720000::I said for losers at my dude.
0:26:41.720000 - 0:26:43.560000::Oh shit.
0:26:45.080000 - 0:26:45.920000::This is the end.
0:26:45.920000 - 0:26:47.680000::This is how joy check is ends right here.
0:26:47.680000 - 0:26:50.800000::By the way, is it weird that you're in LA Eric
0:26:50.800000 - 0:26:51.920000::and I'm in New York.
0:26:51.920000 - 0:26:55.920000::We just swapped, we just did a wife swap me and Eric.
0:26:55.920000 - 0:26:59.760000::And wife swap, wife swap.
0:26:59.760000 - 0:27:02.640000::Would you guys ever, I would do a wife,
0:27:02.640000 - 0:27:04.520000::well, no, I wouldn't, I meant to say,
0:27:04.520000 - 0:27:07.440000::I wouldn't ever do a wife swap ever.
0:27:07.440000 - 0:27:08.360000::Because you're loyal.
0:27:10.560000 - 0:27:11.560000::Too much loyalty.
0:27:11.560000 - 0:27:15::I don't even wanna think about that shit.
0:27:15 - 0:27:18.280000::I would swap wives if it meant getting medical treatment
0:27:18.280000 - 0:27:19.120000::for the other wife.
0:27:19.120000 - 0:27:22::I was like, oh, I'm swapping wives with somebody
0:27:22 - 0:27:23.720000::from another country and they get a chance
0:27:23.720000 - 0:27:25.880000::to come to America to get medical treatment.
0:27:25.880000 - 0:27:27.360000::Of course I would swap my wife and that.
0:27:27.360000 - 0:27:29.760000::I feel like that's an app.
0:27:29.760000 - 0:27:31.760000::That's a fucking new medical system that we would do.
0:27:31.760000 - 0:27:33.080000::I would do a homie swap.
0:27:33.080000 - 0:27:34.040000::Like a wife swap.
0:27:34.040000 - 0:27:34.920000::A homie swap?
0:27:34.920000 - 0:27:36.200000::The homie swap?
0:27:36.200000 - 0:27:38.560000::Well, yeah.
0:27:38.560000 - 0:27:40.280000::Let me just say, I wanna,
0:27:41.320000 - 0:27:43.280000::how do we get, I'm just wondering how we can do this
0:27:43.280000 - 0:27:45.560000::with Pedro Pascal somehow.
0:27:45.560000 - 0:27:47.200000::You wanna hit him out with his friends?
0:27:47.200000 - 0:27:48.280000::Or with, or with him?
0:27:48.760000 - 0:27:50.320000::No, hit up his friends.
0:27:50.320000 - 0:27:52.080000::Okay, we poach his friends and say,
0:27:52.080000 - 0:27:54.800000::yeah, we have something called a homie swap documentary
0:27:54.800000 - 0:27:55.960000::that we're talking about.
0:27:55.960000 - 0:27:58.440000::Yeah, DM his best friend, find the best friend,
0:27:58.440000 - 0:27:59.800000::and then he's like, well, I guess I have to
0:27:59.800000 - 0:28:03.160000::to throw my best friend into this and it's Pedro Pascal.
0:28:03.160000 - 0:28:05.760000::Uh oh, and I'm switching with Pedro.
0:28:05.760000 - 0:28:07.040000::I'm the one they swapping with.
0:28:07.040000 - 0:28:07.880000::And so I'm out there.
0:28:07.880000 - 0:28:10.720000::Yeah, you gotta go chill with his best friends.
0:28:10.720000 - 0:28:12.640000::Yeah, and I get to fucking go,
0:28:14.240000 - 0:28:15.080000::do ketamine.
0:28:15.080000 - 0:28:16.800000::We're going on bike rides and opening coconuts
0:28:16.800000 - 0:28:19.920000::from street vendors and talking about.
0:28:19.920000 - 0:28:21.240000::Kick coconuts.
0:28:21.240000 - 0:28:22.080000::Yeah.
0:28:23.600000 - 0:28:25.560000::I see a coconut on the side of the road.
0:28:25.560000 - 0:28:28.960000::Here's a funny picture I get from my dad very frequently.
0:28:28.960000 - 0:28:32.200000::Every time he opens, but he gets coconuts
0:28:32.200000 - 0:28:35.080000::from street vendors a lot and every time he gets one,
0:28:35.080000 - 0:28:36.880000::he'll send me a pretty scary selfie of him
0:28:36.880000 - 0:28:39.280000::with a coconut in the middle of the city.
0:28:39.280000 - 0:28:40.360000::It's an odd picture.
0:28:41.520000 - 0:28:43.200000::In Virginia?
0:28:43.200000 - 0:28:46.080000::Yeah, you can get on a bike trail in Virginia up to DC.
0:28:46.080000 - 0:28:47.120000::That's pretty fun.
0:28:47.120000 - 0:28:49.800000::And I'm not going to, I don't want to,
0:28:49.800000 - 0:28:53::you guys are trying to get me not to get keep.
0:28:53 - 0:28:57.360000::Yeah, I'm gatekeeping this coconut street vendor in Virginia.
0:28:57.360000 - 0:28:58.200000::Nice try.
0:28:58.200000 - 0:29:03.160000::Is there a coconut grow that they get the coconuts from?
0:29:03.160000 - 0:29:04.800000::I've been looking for all my whole life.
0:29:04.800000 - 0:29:07.120000::So I don't know, I know that there is one.
0:29:07.120000 - 0:29:07.960000::I don't know.
0:29:07.960000 - 0:29:09.800000::Wait, wait, we're going to find you a coconut grove.
0:29:09.800000 - 0:29:10.640000::And wait, wait, wait.
0:29:10.640000 - 0:29:12.320000::I do want to say, Nate, Nate, say what you're saying,
0:29:12.320000 - 0:29:14.840000::but I have a memory about coconut that I want to get.
0:29:14.840000 - 0:29:15.680000::And then all.
0:29:17.080000 - 0:29:18.240000::Oh, OK.
0:29:18.240000 - 0:29:19.760000::This is what I want to say.
0:29:19.760000 - 0:29:23.680000::I think we need to talk about gatekeeping to be honest.
0:29:23.680000 - 0:29:25.760000::Let me send my coconut shit then real quick.
0:29:25.760000 - 0:29:26.520000::Let me just say the coconut.
0:29:26.520000 - 0:29:28.360000::This is going to be a full, this might be a turn
0:29:28.360000 - 0:29:29.720000::into a four hour discussion.
0:29:29.720000 - 0:29:32.840000::So say your little coconut.
0:29:32.840000 - 0:29:33.360000::Quit.
0:29:33.360000 - 0:29:36.640000::Well, well, well, one of the most beautiful moments
0:29:36.640000 - 0:29:39.480000::of my life was when I worked on the cruise ship,
0:29:39.480000 - 0:29:42.240000::when I went to this, I forget what island this was.
0:29:42.240000 - 0:29:45.280000::But we went to a little island in the Caribbean.

0:34:54.960000 - 0:34:59.120000::sometimes I got I got about four inches on Nate and his hands are about double
0:34:59.120000 - 0:35:02::the size of my hand

0:35:00 - 0:35:17::I want to keep it. I want to just let because people are like, oh, well, Nate said he was going to say something about gatekeeping and I was fucking 10 minutes ago. Yeah, I don't fucking forget what I'm about to say and it was going to bring it up right now.
0:35:17 - 0:35:33::I'm not wrong with that gatekeeping. We need to fucking talk about it. And I know I gate kept a YMCA location in a previous episode, but I personally think that gatekeeping I'm done doing that. I'm never doing it again.
0:35:33 - 0:36:02::And I think that we are in an era where we need to let everybody we are in the era of free information on the internet and why would why in the hell would I withhold knowledge that I have to the next generation because in the end I care about this art form of creativity and I want people to know what I know so that they can make their masterpieces why in the hell would I get keep opportunities people.
0:36:03 - 0:36:32::Technological gear that I know about I want to let people know that shit. Okay. I don't want to get keep anything. I'm an open book. Show them the phone you got. The phone I got Nate's talking about. Well, he was gatekeeping has come from here. It's called T-Mobile. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I got an iPhone 13 now. Nate's been getting to think I would be a T-Mobile on Myrtle and Vanderbilt.
0:36:32 - 0:37:01::And I got scammed. I think they added. There's no. This is what happened. I still don't know the full extent of the scam. I will see it on my bill coming up. But he was like to get this discount. You need to add a line onto your your bill. So now I have three lines. Okay, I too on this. No, Nate. I had to add a line. And then I looked at the contract and there was not one.
0:37:01 - 0:37:29::There was two lines added. So I have two extra phone numbers. I have two extra phone numbers now that I'm not using that I don't know where they are. I don't know how to access them. That can go to somebody. If somebody actually if somebody needs a number, hit me up. If you need a number for your at the bar and you need a number for the side chick that you're talking to. You're talking about that burner phone. You have a burner.
0:37:29 - 0:37:46::I have a burner. How does it work? Where's who do you get the call if they call that number? Yeah, and I will get but I get to text them. Okay, you'll be a wingman. And I get and I guarantee you the digital wingman. I will fucking hook it up. There's no question. You're about to go home with their.
0:37:46 - 0:37:56::Lay it down. Lay it down. I've a T-Mobile account. 17 dudes. So all their side shakes. I'm messaging all them.
0:37:56 - 0:38:01::I find it very hard to get on board with what you're saying, frankly, Nate.
0:38:01 - 0:38:20::To stop gatekeeping. Very hard word to say because I guess this is where what's ironic is my scarcity mindset comes in where I go. I'm not telling people about UC bleep because they have the best improv comedy shows.
0:38:20 - 0:38:25::I'm not telling classes that are going to take you to the next. Let them know, bro. Just let them know I'm not going to. I can't.
0:38:25 - 0:38:39::Because then because I need to because I'm insecure about my bag. Do you see what I'm saying? Right. Why am I going to tell people about the Toyota Rav bleep? Because you know what I'm saying? Right. Well, what's the toy?
0:38:39 - 0:38:51::You know what's curious alert curious alert curious alert. What's curious right now is that yeah, I might have a scarcity mindset when it comes to finances.
0:38:51 - 0:39:03::But where I do have an abundance mindset is in ideas and information that do not have a monetary value associated with them.
0:39:03 - 0:39:21::And polyamory sexual. Yeah, I'm not keeping what is in my. I just. I want to say birthrights are declining and this is people are scoffing that this is in the big deal. This is a big fucking deal. We have built a world around eight nine billion.
0:39:21 - 0:39:35::Pop up population whatever if this goes down horrible things will happen stop monogamy needs to end now stop it now. We need to get out there spread the spread the love spread the one world.
0:39:35 - 0:39:52::We're all in one job. We are acknowledging. That's right. That's right. I want to stop pretending like. You know, we made up all these rules because the Bible told me something. I didn't. And I feel like, you know, it's just.
0:39:52 - 0:40:00::You know, I don't want to be at my deathbed going like what why didn't I just, you know, get down a little more, you know, I'm saying have 20 kids.

0:40:00 - 0:40:01.480000::with 20 different women.
0:40:01.480000 - 0:40:02.480000::That's what I'm saying.
0:40:02.480000 - 0:40:03.580000::And then have 20.
0:40:03.580000 - 0:40:04.420000::Yeah.
0:40:04.420000 - 0:40:07.640000::And then I feel like that might be what's holding back
0:40:07.640000 - 0:40:10.920000::the aliens from coming down is that they're like,
0:40:10.920000 - 0:40:14.120000::if we were all in one gigantic polycule,
0:40:14.120000 - 0:40:16.120000::all right.
0:40:16.120000 - 0:40:17.880000::And then the aliens hop in.
0:40:17.880000 - 0:40:18.720000::Yep.
0:40:18.720000 - 0:40:19.560000::To that.
0:40:19.560000 - 0:40:21.400000::I feel like they're coming down here to hook up.
0:40:21.400000 - 0:40:22.960000::I just got a good idea for you to.
0:40:22.960000 - 0:40:25.360000::Oh, I know that there's.
0:40:25.360000 - 0:40:27.040000::There's sex to us from the aliens.
0:40:27.040000 - 0:40:28.120000::There's no question.
0:40:28.120000 - 0:40:29.360000::They're already down here.
0:40:29.440000 - 0:40:30.720000::Oh, well, look at Mitch McConnell.
0:40:30.720000 - 0:40:32.240000::You already know you could unzip his.
0:40:35 - 0:40:37.440000::He's definitely here on the mission.
0:40:37.440000 - 0:40:41.440000::And his mission is, you know, he's barely, he's barely fitting that.
0:40:41.440000 - 0:40:44.040000::He's barely fitting that big purple ass into that skin.
0:40:44.040000 - 0:40:45.080000::So it's basically.
0:40:45.080000 - 0:40:46.080000::Yeah.
0:40:46.080000 - 0:40:46.600000::Really.
0:40:46.600000 - 0:40:47.400000::Are you kidding me?
0:40:47.400000 - 0:40:48.560000::I see his ass popping out.
0:40:48.560000 - 0:40:49.160000::Yeah.
0:40:49.160000 - 0:40:50.920000::Scarlett Johansson and under the skin.
0:40:50.920000 - 0:40:51.440000::Yep.
0:40:51.440000 - 0:40:52.720000::Watch that last night.
0:40:58.080000 - 0:40:58.560000::Now.
0:40:58.560000 - 0:41:00.840000::We don't talk about people like that.
0:41:00.840000 - 0:41:02.240000::Oh, I've never talked about anybody.
0:41:02.240000 - 0:41:07.160000::But what I'm saying is, not joy tactics, can I remember?
0:41:07.160000 - 0:41:08::Joy tactics.
0:41:08 - 0:41:10.240000::Oh, don't I look like, I look like shit.
0:41:10.240000 - 0:41:11.480000::I look like hey, they're Delilah, right?
0:41:11.480000 - 0:41:12.440000::Stop.
0:41:12.440000 - 0:41:13.560000::Stop it, man.
0:41:13.560000 - 0:41:15.320000::Would you stop it, bro?
0:41:15.320000 - 0:41:17.360000::I look like a fucking baby sucks.
0:41:17.360000 - 0:41:18.640000::I don't know if I'm a great empty.
0:41:18.640000 - 0:41:19.400000::Everybody's complimenting you.
0:41:19.400000 - 0:41:20.520000::I look like someone with a gambling problem
0:41:20.520000 - 0:41:23.440000::in the target 2015 target t-shirt.
0:41:26.160000 - 0:41:27.160000::You look great.
0:41:27.160000 - 0:41:29.600000::Just, you know the mean.
0:41:29.600000 - 0:41:35.200000::It's so pointless to be kind to yourself, to be frank.
0:41:35.200000 - 0:41:36.920000::Because that says a lot.
0:41:36.920000 - 0:41:39.600000::That you think that says a lot, dude.
0:41:39.600000 - 0:41:40.920000::There does say a lot, man.
0:41:40.920000 - 0:41:42.800000::But what am I going to do live?
0:41:42.800000 - 0:41:44.920000::Live by my opinions and my truth.
0:41:44.920000 - 0:41:47.680000::I'd rather just be honest, no matter how dark it is.
0:41:47.680000 - 0:41:48.680000::That's the one thing I'd want you to do.
0:41:48.680000 - 0:41:50.480000::This is what I want to bring up.
0:41:50.480000 - 0:41:52.040000::Nate, wants to bring up pudding.
0:41:52.040000 - 0:41:53.160000::I want to bring up.
0:41:53.160000 - 0:41:58.240000::Do you think that you can gamble with emotions?
0:41:58.240000 - 0:42:01.480000::Sometimes when you're putting yourself out there,
0:42:01.480000 - 0:42:03.680000::do you think that that is a gamble?
0:42:03.680000 - 0:42:07.560000::Because maybe my vulnerability might not
0:42:07.560000 - 0:42:11.640000::be met with kindness, loving affection.
0:42:11.640000 - 0:42:15.600000::Maybe it might backfire me telling somebody something
0:42:15.600000 - 0:42:18::that I thought was going to.
0:42:18 - 0:42:20.440000::Where's your head, man?
0:42:20.440000 - 0:42:22.160000::Dude.
0:42:22.160000 - 0:42:23.800000::I'm sorry.
0:42:23.800000 - 0:42:24.800000::Jack, stop.
0:42:24.800000 - 0:42:28.240000::I like your playful attitude, but it's not the tip.
0:42:28.240000 - 0:42:28.920000::All right.
0:42:28.920000 - 0:42:29.920000::You're right.
0:42:29.920000 - 0:42:31.920000::Sorry.
0:42:31.920000 - 0:42:32.920000::You're saying emotionally.
0:42:32.920000 - 0:42:35.120000::No, that's a great question.
0:42:35.120000 - 0:42:39.560000::People tend to think, I guess just from their conceptions
0:42:39.560000 - 0:42:44.600000::of me, whatever, that I have an unlimited social battery.
0:42:44.600000 - 0:42:46.880000::And it's just frankly not the case.
0:42:46.880000 - 0:42:49.440000::So people want to chill with me basically every night.
0:42:49.440000 - 0:42:54.360000::And it's just a little different from what?
0:42:54.360000 - 0:42:55.280000::No, no, listen.
0:42:55.280000 - 0:42:56.600000::No, no, listen.
0:42:56.600000 - 0:42:58.280000::It's a gamble.
0:42:58.280000 - 0:43:00.760000::Because I'm like, man, I'm on fucking empty right now.
0:43:00.760000 - 0:43:04.760000::I need to go back home and do my whatever, typo,
0:43:04.760000 - 0:43:06.960000::or whatever, do some meat time.
0:43:06.960000 - 0:43:09.560000::Take a two hour shower, put it on the CPAP.
0:43:09.560000 - 0:43:10.240000::But just sit with it.
0:43:10.240000 - 0:43:11.080000::You're self-perioding.
0:43:11.080000 - 0:43:12.080000::I'm on Tiktok.
0:43:12.080000 - 0:43:14.080000::Putting it in a tie-bought DVD.
0:43:14.080000 - 0:43:15.240000::Put it in a tie-bought DVD.
0:43:15.240000 - 0:43:18.080000::Yeah, and then laying down in my bed with the CPAP in my nose
0:43:18.080000 - 0:43:19.720000::and watching Tiktok for three hours.
0:43:19.720000 - 0:43:22.960000::That's what I did yesterday.
0:43:22.960000 - 0:43:26.200000::So I could recharge like that, which I know helps recharge
0:43:26.200000 - 0:43:28.680000::the battery, or I could gamble on a low battery
0:43:28.680000 - 0:43:30.400000::and go out and see my friends.
0:43:30.400000 - 0:43:31.440000::Is that worth it?
0:43:31.440000 - 0:43:32.600000::You know what I'm saying?
0:43:32.600000 - 0:43:35.400000::Is the extraversion going to actually recharge me?
0:43:35.400000 - 0:43:36.440000::That's a gamble.
0:43:36.440000 - 0:43:37.840000::You sometimes you don't, because it's
0:43:37.840000 - 0:43:40.280000::weird for us combo, extroverts, and introverts.
0:43:40.280000 - 0:43:41.600000::There's so few of us.
0:43:41.600000 - 0:43:44.480000::So you want me to just be very careful.
0:43:44.480000 - 0:43:45.320000::Please.

0:43:53.560000 - 0:43:58.280000::So what I'm saying is, yeah, one time, the only time in my life
0:43:58.280000 - 0:44:01.040000::I've ever been depressed, usually I'm never ever like that.
0:44:01.040000 - 0:44:03.080000::But one time, it got me.
0:44:03.080000 - 0:44:05.640000::And I was sad as fuck.
0:44:05.640000 - 0:44:08.280000::And I was thinking, maybe I'll cancel this comedy show,
0:44:08.280000 - 0:44:11.160000::dude, because I don't want to bring my poisonous energy
0:44:11.160000 - 0:44:12.480000::and influence people.
0:44:12.480000 - 0:44:15.680000::I want to dive on the grenade of sadness that is live.
0:44:16.640000 - 0:44:19.480000::And the spiritual realm.
0:44:19.480000 - 0:44:22.040000::And just let it go out.
0:44:22.040000 - 0:44:24.480000::But what I didn't realize is, I said, you know what?
0:44:24.480000 - 0:44:26.800000::Let me get some sushi from the grocery store.
0:44:26.800000 - 0:44:28.520000::I need it on the sidewalk.
0:44:28.520000 - 0:44:31.360000::And then let me just drag my ass.
0:44:31.360000 - 0:44:35.280000::Let me swallow my pride and drag my ass to the comedy show.
0:44:35.280000 - 0:44:36.200000::And what happened when I got there?
0:44:36.200000 - 0:44:37.920000::And you body'd so hard.
0:44:37.920000 - 0:44:39.800000::Oh my god, who a Lou was there.

0:44:41.240000 - 0:44:44.120000::Who was there?
0:44:44.120000 - 0:44:46.280000::No, obviously who Lou was there?
0:44:46.280000 - 0:44:47.400000::It's not where I'm going with this.
0:44:47.400000 - 0:44:48.800000::This is about human connection, dude.
0:44:48.800000 - 0:44:50::It's not about the industry.
0:44:50 - 0:44:51.040000::OK, OK.
0:44:51.040000 - 0:44:53.960000::Even if there was somebody, even if there was,
0:44:53.960000 - 0:44:58.280000::listen, I'm not going to lie and say that, yeah, all right.
0:44:58.280000 - 0:45:00::Three arts was there that is where

0:45:00 - 0:45:05.600000::the story is going and everybody that listens to this is going to recognize three
0:45:05.600000 - 0:45:11.960000::arts. You don't know what three art is turn this off right now because the rest of
0:45:11.960000 - 0:45:16.080000::this episode is going to be boring. I think that you know I'm reading this book
0:45:16.080000 - 0:45:22.240000::Hyperion okay and the very the first two pages of it is just the characters
0:45:22.240000 - 0:45:26.400000::and then it has a description of the characters. It's not even a part of like a
0:45:26.400000 - 0:45:31.520000::chapter. I just like that. Here's the the pilgrims that are you like you're
0:45:31.520000 - 0:45:36.560000::like Avengers Squad. So you can kind of go back and be like oh I for you know
0:45:36.560000 - 0:45:40.600000::because sometimes you you gloss over a character's physical description or
0:45:40.600000 - 0:45:43.160000::something like that and you're like oh I forgot what they even look like and
0:45:43.160000 - 0:45:46.720000::who they are you can go back to this and I think we need a joy tactics version
0:45:46.720000 - 0:45:53.200000::of that where we can list all of the agencies and just any sort of reference
0:45:53.200000 - 0:45:58::that so we don't have to go by the way three arts is a management and agency
0:45:58 - 0:46:02.400000::company in the industry right so you can just rest on those three arts CAA and
0:46:02.400000 - 0:46:06.160000::UTA get them tattooed on your on your bus we could have we could have like CAA
0:46:06.160000 - 0:46:10.960000::in there we could have just tip different types of rum so we reference right
0:46:10.960000 - 0:46:17.240000::but what up WME by the way of course that's a great one that's a great one so what
0:46:17.240000 - 0:46:19.720000::I'm saying is though and that's how I introduce myself every time I meet

0:47:16.440000 - 0:47:25.560000::ask for help and sometimes it's it's a damn escalating because you want people to
0:47:25.560000 - 0:47:30.360000::continue to see you the fur the way you are Jack isn't like I see you as like this

1:04:27.200000 - 1:04:29.960000::And I walked in just to scope it out because
1:04:30.320000 - 1:04:34.920000::Before I take my girl on a date I like to go take myself there first to make sure that's up to standards

1:05:35.400000 - 1:05:39.240000::I was forced to find joy from deep within my pelvis
1:05:39.240000 - 1:05:41.080000::and pull that shit out and say, you know what?
1:05:41.080000 - 1:05:44.680000::I have a business credit card.
1:05:44.680000 - 1:05:47.880000::So I tapped my business credit card
