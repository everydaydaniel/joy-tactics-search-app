0:04:33.960000 - 0:04:38.600000::He seems like he comes in and he's like, the first thing he says after he's introduced,
0:04:38.600000 - 0:04:40.320000::he's like, interesting lecture hall.
0:04:40.320000 - 0:04:42.640000::He's like, I didn't actually attend many of these.
0:04:42.640000 - 0:04:44.160000::I skipped class a lot in college.
0:04:44.160000 - 0:04:46.440000::I was working on my own stuff.

0:04:52.680000 - 0:04:55.080000::literally 12 people in the lecture.
0:04:55.080000 - 0:04:56.680000::Well, because he's and he was a baddie.

0:05:22.040000 - 0:05:23.040000::He did.

0:05:44.120000 - 0:05:47.720000::And he did all of the impression of all the characters.
0:05:47.720000 - 0:05:48.880000::Did he do a poo?
0:05:48.880000 - 0:05:50.920000::Well, he did.
0:05:50.920000 - 0:05:51.920000::It was mostly a poo.

0:05:53.680000 - 0:05:56.080000::No, I don't think he did a poo.
0:05:56.120000 - 0:05:59.440000::He did like, it was just the cringiest thing I've ever seen in my life.
0:05:59.440000 - 0:06:02.720000::Like, really, you think that's cringe?
0:06:02.720000 - 0:06:04.280000::I'd like to see you get even close to that.
0:06:04.280000 - 0:06:05.720000::But you couldn't even do three red lines.
0:06:05.720000 - 0:06:07.400000::I can not even be cringe at all.
0:06:07.400000 - 0:06:10.600000::I've never even gotten close to it in one second in my life.
0:06:10.600000 - 0:06:12.200000::Give me a Bart impression.

0:06:17.560000 - 0:06:19.400000::I didn't even say what he was talking about.
0:06:19.400000 - 0:06:21.120000::That was awful.
0:06:21.120000 - 0:06:22.520000::I forget what he even said.
0:06:22.520000 - 0:06:23.800000::He says my shorts.
0:06:23.800000 - 0:06:25.200000::He just sounded really good.
0:06:25.200000 - 0:06:27.480000::Yeah.

0:06:31.600000 - 0:06:34.840000::What if I came in with that silver tooth?
0:06:34.840000 - 0:06:36.800000::I didn't mean that it was silver tooth.
0:06:36.800000 - 0:06:38.960000::Well, because that way people do that anymore.
0:06:38.960000 - 0:06:42::You know, I just got a good Dracula defense idea.
0:06:42 - 0:06:45.960000::Why don't they just wear, how do you kill him with silver?
0:06:45.960000 - 0:06:46.960000::It's silver bullets.
0:06:46.960000 - 0:06:47.800000::Oh, garlic.
0:06:47.800000 - 0:06:48.880000::No, no, garlic is a myth.

0:06:50.080000 - 0:06:52.520000::Well, I'm saying if it was garlic or silver bullets,
0:06:52.520000 - 0:06:54.600000::all you got to do is make a garlic scarf.
0:06:54.600000 - 0:06:56.360000::And then when he goes to bite your neck,
0:06:56.360000 - 0:06:57.520000::you got to go to garlic on.
0:06:57.520000 - 0:06:59.400000::Oh, that's just one of the fucking they just do.
0:06:59.400000 - 0:07:00.560000::You're gonna hold garlic out.
0:07:00.560000 - 0:07:01.720000::Why aren't they a guy that are on there?
0:07:01.720000 - 0:07:03.560000::And then he just smacks it out of his way and bites it.
0:07:03.560000 - 0:07:04.640000::The poor shell garlic.
0:07:04.640000 - 0:07:06.440000::That was it.

0:08:31.960000 - 0:08:35.040000::demographics of the people that listen to the podcast.
0:08:35.040000 - 0:08:40.560000::And shockingly, it's skewing about 86% male.

0:12:07.060000 - 0:12:10.660000::This question is I would say a very modern question and
0:12:11.580000 - 0:12:13.740000::Jack is playing footsie with me into the table
0:12:13.740000 - 0:12:17.500000::I'm trying to concentrate and make a great record for the podcast. Thanks, man

0:12:28.060000 - 0:12:29.060000::but
0:12:29.060000 - 0:12:32.900000::Why has society turned against on tripin'
0:12:32.900000 - 0:12:35.940000::Wars because we were thinking back in the day
0:12:36.540000 - 0:12:43.260000::We used to glorify these people we really do about the business owner and it was about the American dream is on
0:12:43.260000 - 0:12:47.340000::Tripin' Rurally well entrepreneurs are having
0:12:48.140000 - 0:12:53.220000::Hit they're beating not hit on but there's hit pieces. You know what I mean? Yeah, right on them
0:12:53.460000 - 0:12:55.460000::But it's hitting on them like that
0:12:56.420000 - 0:12:58.420000::What they are is a scapegoat
0:12:58.420000 - 0:13:03.100000::For the system right because everybody's being held down financially and class wise
0:13:03.100000 - 0:13:07.860000::Right and they don't realize that it's the whole system and it's so it's easy to say oh it's Mark Zuckerberg
0:13:07.860000 - 0:13:12.220000::Oh, it's John whatever name a big good one, but these are tycoons. These are not entrepreneurs
0:13:12.660000 - 0:13:15.900000::Well, man, you say that was a good
0:13:16.780000 - 0:13:18.780000::well

0:13:27.380000 - 0:13:34.340000::Hating on them because they're doing something that they know they have within them they're afraid to do and so what they're doing is they are
0:13:35.140000 - 0:13:39.460000::Making themselves feel good by making the people who are doing what they want to do feel bad
0:13:39.460000 - 0:13:42.060000::I just had a revolution your idea

0:14:09.220000 - 0:14:15.020000::It just took three simple ghosts to go through his life and kind of empathize with him and show him
0:14:15.740000 - 0:14:23.380000::Empathy for him to turn around and become donating all of his money to the crippled children and donating all of his money to the
0:14:24.380000 - 0:14:26.380000::Or yet donating
0:14:26.860000 - 0:14:28.860000::Axon oh, you know what we are
0:14:30.100000 - 0:14:35.260000::In the American English these more accents in the language we'll get to that on the list section of the podcast

0:15:05.840000 - 0:15:07.800000::And you know, future is not really a ghost.
0:15:07.800000 - 0:15:09.200000::It's actually just death.
0:15:09.200000 - 0:15:12.880000::Oh, oh, that's right because I come in and I let it get real.
0:15:12.880000 - 0:15:14.760000::Maybe I'm Christmas future, I don't know.
0:15:14.760000 - 0:15:15.760000::I don't know.

0:15:24.400000 - 0:15:27.080000::mostly billionaires are evil, but have you ever thought
0:15:27.080000 - 0:15:28.720000::to ask what they might be feeling?
0:15:28.720000 - 0:15:31.240000::And have you ever thought to consider what pressure
0:15:31.240000 - 0:15:34.160000::is on their shoulders with that money in the bank account?
0:15:34.160000 - 0:15:36.640000::You've never had more than $10,000 in your bank account.

0:16:59.480000 - 0:17:03.360000::Like, I'm like, I have busted out my ear drums from the amount of
0:17:03.360000 - 0:17:04.840000::your years blown out.
0:17:05.160000 - 0:17:05.960000::You guys time.
0:17:05.960000 - 0:17:08.480000::Oh, dude, arcade fire blew my ears out last night.
0:17:11.480000 - 0:17:16.280000::But I am embarrassed because I have legitimately rolled up to like pick up Jane,
0:17:16.280000 - 0:17:18.400000::my girlfriend and just been bullied.
0:17:18.400000 - 0:17:23.520000::Like when I'm in the car by myself, it's, it's I'm in the, I crank it up to the
0:17:23.520000 - 0:17:24.520000::max volume.
0:17:25.960000 - 0:17:28.160000::You're your glass and a baby came orange.
0:17:28.160000 - 0:17:30.440000::So exactly like my face.
0:17:30.440000 - 0:17:31.440000::I attack that.
0:17:32.440000 - 0:17:34.440000::Make it expect me to be listening to.
0:17:34.440000 - 0:17:37.400000::I'm listening to the craziest hardest music you've ever.
0:17:40 - 0:17:41.680000::And Jane is just like, who's that?
0:17:41.680000 - 0:17:43.720000::You know, like she's with people and I'm picking her up.
0:17:43.720000 - 0:17:44.400000::I know.
0:17:44.400000 - 0:17:46.440000::And I, and it's embarrassing.
0:17:46.440000 - 0:17:49::Your kids are going to love going to school when you drop my.
0:17:49 - 0:17:51.400000::Oh God, I cannot wait to embarrass the fuck.
0:17:51.400000 - 0:17:52.240000::I don't mind.
0:17:52.240000 - 0:17:55.400000::I kind of think I like the opposite because I like to keep it mysterious.
0:17:55.640000 - 0:17:58.760000::So everybody's chilling out walking to school, walking across the park.
0:17:59 - 0:18:02.600000::And then all of a sudden this car comes whipping by 150 and a 35.
0:18:03.480000 - 0:18:08.240000::And right when you hear that, you hear this little tinny little yesterday, you hear the Beatles.
0:18:10.600000 - 0:18:15.760000::But for this, my smallest amount of time, because I'm going by so fast that it's
0:18:15.760000 - 0:18:17.640000::Doppler shifting yesterday, you know what I mean?
0:18:19.080000 - 0:18:20.200000::It was like, whoa, shit.
0:18:20.200000 - 0:18:20.720000::What was that?
0:18:20.720000 - 0:18:21.400000::I'm a clarin.
0:18:21.800000 - 0:18:22.760000::You know, I'm at my clarin.
0:18:22.760000 - 0:18:23.440000::F1.
0:18:23.960000 - 0:18:24.720000::Oh, shit.
0:18:24.720000 - 0:18:29.600000::What was Ben singing listening to one barely coming out out of a like little bike speaker that you have.
0:18:31.440000 - 0:18:32.280000::So that's my vibe.
0:18:33.280000 - 0:18:40.040000::And let's see for me, I'm kind of somewhere in the middle where I would, I don't really
0:18:40.040000 - 0:18:43.800000::care about the music because I have, I'm wearing my noise canceling headphones at all times.
0:18:45.640000 - 0:18:46.280000::But I'm driving.
0:18:46.280000 - 0:18:48::I got you know, you're distracted by the horns.
0:18:48.320000 - 0:18:50.200000::Yeah, I'm locked in when I'm driving.
0:18:50.200000 - 0:18:50.920000::So I got that one.
0:18:51.200000 - 0:18:54.600000::But the kind of car I want to drive is I forget what they call these.
0:18:54.600000 - 0:18:56.160000::These are like sleeper cars or something.
0:18:56.160000 - 0:18:59.680000::It's like the cells cops drive these where it's a cop car.
0:18:59.680000 - 0:19:01.680000::It looks like it's a slow car on the outside.
0:19:01.880000 - 0:19:02.320000::Okay.
0:19:02.640000 - 0:19:03.960000::But it's got a crazy ass.
0:19:03.960000 - 0:19:05.560000::It's like the forget for them.
0:19:05.880000 - 0:19:08.760000::It's leaper bills Chevy Impala's are kind of like the sleeper builds.
0:19:09.080000 - 0:19:15.400000::And then when you need to make a manual mode 60, 70 miles an hour as fast as you can go.
0:19:15.400000 - 0:19:16::Right.
0:19:16 - 0:19:16.560000::Go go.
0:19:16.560000 - 0:19:17.320000::Go up to 80.
0:19:18.240000 - 0:19:19::Pressing the rain.
0:19:19 - 0:19:19.840000::Fucker.
0:19:19.840000 - 0:19:20.560000::Surprise motherfucker.
0:19:21.040000 - 0:19:21.360000::Go on.
0:19:21.360000 - 0:19:22.240000::In six.
0:19:22.240000 - 0:19:23.240000::Zing.
0:19:23.760000 - 0:19:24.600000::And home.
0:19:24.800000 - 0:19:25.400000::That's amazing.
0:19:25.400000 - 0:19:31.240000::I would love my dream is always impressing people and shocking people with how good I am at something.
0:19:31.440000 - 0:19:33.440000::My dream is to go 90 miles an hour one day.
0:19:34.320000 - 0:19:35.640000::And this was a tough day.
0:19:35.640000 - 0:19:39.800000::This was a tough question for us to even consider by the way because usually when we hear cars,
0:19:39.800000 - 0:19:43.360000::we want to jump right into the climate change conversation and fossil fuels.
0:19:43.360000 - 0:19:44.120000::I know it's hard.
0:19:44.120000 - 0:19:46.680000::So it was fun for a second to put that aside.
0:19:46.680000 - 0:19:48.920000::We would be seeing more shit happening with the climate.
0:19:48.920000 - 0:19:51.880000::That she was actually the fucking climate changing.
0:19:51.880000 - 0:19:53.800000::I'm like, sorry to curse.
0:19:54.600000 - 0:19:56.160000::It's an emergency at this point.
0:19:56.160000 - 0:19:57.360000::It's climate emergency.
0:19:57.360000 - 0:19:58.600000::We've so you claim.
0:19:58.600000 - 0:19:59.960000::And by the way, just a

0:20:00 - 0:20:03.680000::little caveat if you feel like we didn't answer your question correctly ask it again
0:20:03.680000 - 0:20:06.880000::to get it so I get very much more elaborately in our
0:20:06.880000 - 0:20:11.440000::dams and I know and I just want to say this that most of the questions are
0:20:11.440000 - 0:20:17.200000::directed towards me personally yeah kind of about like because there's about seven of them say like
0:20:17.200000 - 0:20:25.600000::how does that thing get so long and we're not gonna address those we've got the people that are
0:20:25.600000 - 0:20:29.760000::asking those questions it's hard honestly to pick some of these because there's most of them
0:20:30.480000 - 0:20:36.720000::just kind of what you got swinging around down there Nate a Nate uh salivating emoji uh
0:20:36.720000 - 0:20:42.240000::fucking eggplant oh what it looked like when it when it when it when the blood get to the to the
0:20:42.240000 - 0:20:46.480000::the dingaling you guys are a homosexual love it no man all right next question
0:20:46.480000 - 0:20:54.160000::all right next but what will the world be like in 100 years from now that's there are two
0:20:54.160000 - 0:21:03.360000::paths of fora uh before us one path is death and one path is barren and it's desert and it's
0:21:03.360000 - 0:21:10.160000::tumbleweeds and it's overgrown cities with no people left okay except for a few people that are
0:21:10.160000 - 0:21:15.680000::that's not also that are very sick no that's death oh this is all those first one I'm not bad the
0:21:15.680000 - 0:21:24.480000::second one is whatever the very good way where it's new cities all over it's America becomes one
0:21:24.480000 - 0:21:29.520000::giant metropolis you should be Trump's speechwriter for realsies because this is this is the
0:21:29.520000 - 0:21:36.080000::winning me over in a way that is reaching beyond politics uh you see what I'm saying we have a choice
0:21:36.080000 - 0:21:42.800000::it's like do you want to live in a hell with fifth fifths the weeds and deserted uh areas or do
0:21:42.800000 - 0:21:47.360000::you want to have more cities and guess what the choices though y'all way I why what's the
0:21:47.360000 - 0:21:51.760000::new city the place where everybody respects each other everybody's getting along everybody's
0:21:51.760000 - 0:21:57.840000::poly that is the amazing future in 100 years the other one is death guess what the choices y'all get
0:21:57.840000 - 0:22:07.440000::good one hint it's on the ballot okay uh one choice public it republicans one choice democrats
0:22:07.440000 - 0:22:13.200000::and guess which one or which democrats need to take over the world the world right there needs to be
0:22:13.200000 - 0:22:19.200000::a world government run specifically by democrats right right right take over all the yes colonize
0:22:19.200000 - 0:22:25.440000::everybody else in the world will look different if that were to be the case and I am down for Biden
0:22:25.440000 - 0:22:32.640000::to become a full-ass dictator I'm just gonna say straight up right now if we got kerson cinema run
0:22:32.640000 - 0:22:39.840000::in Thailand amazing incredible huh that's how oh my goodness here's a cinema running Thailand
0:22:39.840000 - 0:22:45.600000::oh yeah because because she's democrat right every other government on the planet is so busted
0:22:45.600000 - 0:22:51.600000::except our system and we need to go over to I feel like we were just starting to cook in 2003
0:22:51.600000 - 0:22:56.080000::with on the back and shit and I was like oh here we go it's about to spray if john carry if john
0:22:56.080000 - 0:23:01.360000::fucking carry had been president guess what we would have eliminated the two-term limit he would have
0:23:01.360000 - 0:23:06.640000::been still serving today he's a guy what these are happening but not not john carry you mentioned
0:23:06.640000 - 0:23:12.880000::Edwards I mean poly we need a poly president we need Biden needs to get poly emberus yes what though
0:23:12.880000 - 0:23:18.320000::they are all poly behind closed doors democracy is one giant form of polyamory it's political
0:23:18.320000 - 0:23:25.360000::am I a political right that's why they called it political system because it's poly oh damn I never
0:23:25.360000 - 0:23:29.440000::even thought of it well you understand such a Latin roots that we can imagine I know I know I know
0:23:29.600000 - 0:23:35.120000::basically South American with it the semantics bending your semantics here's the difference here's
0:23:35.120000 - 0:23:40.720000::what democracy is we're always chasing the most direct former democracy right how can we make it
0:23:40.720000 - 0:23:45.120000::wonder how can I talk to you more directly and more and more directly America has mastered it with
0:23:45.120000 - 0:23:50.240000::the by what ever it's called the dual party system right everybody is directly repression
0:23:50.240000 - 0:23:56.080000::represented um I'm a little bit of oh beyond I'm a little bit ashamed of that question
0:23:57.040000 - 0:24:02.240000::a hundred years that's all right you got to be thinking you gotta ask yourself I'm sorry but
0:24:02.240000 - 0:24:07.680000::you gotta ask us even further down the road because a hundred years ago what was 2000 or 1920
0:24:08.240000 - 0:24:14.320000::and so that was where were they were so depressed back then well weren't they having fun no 100
0:24:14.320000 - 0:24:19.680000::years ago is about the great no one was a great depression 1929 yeah probably fine all right so
0:24:19.680000 - 0:24:24.800000::they were actually living it up doing kind of all those cringy dances flapper style and they're
0:24:24.800000 - 0:24:30.400000::you can whatever absinthe and they were getting all fucked up with jazz and so until 29 that's when
0:24:30.400000 - 0:24:36.720000::it went that's when the market crashed if you follow the logical trajectory in that case
0:24:37.520000 - 0:24:47.200000::a hundred more years we're gonna have two more war world wars we're gonna have a new car we're
0:24:47.200000 - 0:24:52.800000::gonna have a new form of movies yep so that's all you have to do to think about what's gonna
0:24:52.800000 - 0:24:58.960000::happen whether through these next kind of 20 years and that's easy I'm so sorry

0:25:00 - 0:25:04.480000::and 20 and 20 years I'll be 40 or I'll be 50 in 20 years.
0:25:04.480000 - 0:25:07.280000::I don't want to think about you being in your feet.
0:25:07.280000 - 0:25:12.920000::I'm going to be so sexual at 50 that you I'm going to unlock some kind of swag in
0:25:12.920000 - 0:25:18.960000::myself by 50 that's I feel like you guys we are living in a alternate reality and I
0:25:18.960000 - 0:25:23.520000::feel like why everything is so fucked up right now is because you were supposed to die
0:25:23.520000 - 0:25:24.520000::at 27.
0:25:24.520000 - 0:25:29.320000::I think I was and I know why was because don't you feel like you're in heaven right now.
0:25:29.320000 - 0:25:37.680000::Oh, there's a crazy breakable chemi Schmidt back for a third see for this season.
0:25:37.680000 - 0:25:40.400000::So much shit we just watch scream.
0:25:40.400000 - 0:25:42.120000::And Kimmy Schmidt again.

0:25:55.080000 - 0:25:56.400000::That was scream six.
0:25:56.400000 - 0:25:58.600000::That was the sixth.
0:25:58.600000 - 0:26:03.520000::Six installment shout out to the guy the guy who says that funny line about a halfway
0:26:03.520000 - 0:26:04.840000::through it that made me laugh.
0:26:04.840000 - 0:26:05.840000::You know who you are.
0:26:05.840000 - 0:26:06.840000::You know who you are.
0:26:06.840000 - 0:26:07.840000::I was really funny with it.
0:26:07.840000 - 0:26:08.840000::Good job.
0:26:08.840000 - 0:26:11.240000::What else we got Nate?
0:26:11.240000 - 0:26:15.720000::Um, okay, if we were in a way I'm going to paraphrase this one.
0:26:15.720000 - 0:26:20.520000::This person wants to know if we were in a band.
0:26:20.520000 - 0:26:25.040000::What kind of genre music would we be playing and what are kind of the band dynamics that
0:26:25.040000 - 0:26:26.040000::would happen?
0:26:26.040000 - 0:26:28.960000::We're in a band existing band.
0:26:28.960000 - 0:26:31.040000::No, we're in a new band.
0:26:31.040000 - 0:26:32.560000::If we were to create a word.
0:26:32.560000 - 0:26:35::So you mean when we created band when we got out.
0:26:35 - 0:26:36::Exactly.
0:26:36 - 0:26:38.520000::We already have a recording company.
0:26:38.520000 - 0:26:39.520000::Yes.
0:26:39.520000 - 0:26:41.520000::What is it?
0:26:41.520000 - 0:26:43::Remember not going to lie.
0:26:43 - 0:26:44::Oh, yeah, not going to lie.
0:26:44 - 0:26:45::NGL productions.
0:26:45 - 0:26:49.840000::I think personally, I think it would be some kind of Simon and Garfunkel situation where
0:26:49.840000 - 0:26:52.320000::there's a third member where or one of it.
0:26:52.320000 - 0:26:53.320000::I don't know.
0:26:53.320000 - 0:26:54.320000::I'm not pointing at you.
0:26:54.320000 - 0:26:56.120000::I'm not really worth it.
0:26:56.120000 - 0:26:57.120000::And they're kind of forgotten.
0:26:57.120000 - 0:26:58.120000::And then.
0:26:58.120000 - 0:27:05.280000::But the two main ones die pretty young and the other one.

0:27:58.360000 - 0:27:59.360000::That's shit.
0:27:59.360000 - 0:28:00.360000::So boring.

0:28:07.360000 - 0:28:09.360000::I know Eric, you would be getting you.
0:28:09.360000 - 0:28:13.360000::I think you couldn't get on stage unless you had like 17 fucking whiskies.
0:28:13.360000 - 0:28:14.360000::You know what I'm saying?
0:28:14.360000 - 0:28:15.360000::Everyone would be like, oh shit.
0:28:15.360000 - 0:28:17.360000::He's like blacked out right now.
0:28:17.360000 - 0:28:20.360000::And it's going to be like a better show because he's going to like go off the go off.
0:28:20.360000 - 0:28:21.360000::I think what to say?
0:28:21.360000 - 0:28:22.360000::Something crazy political.
0:28:22.360000 - 0:28:24.360000::I think here's what would happen.
0:28:24.360000 - 0:28:25.960000::Most of the concerts are ranting.
0:28:25.960000 - 0:28:31.360000::First album I'm wearing like 28 inch waist leather pants.
0:28:31.360000 - 0:28:32.360000::Okay.
0:28:32.360000 - 0:28:34.120000::I'm like looking so fine.
0:28:34.120000 - 0:28:37.360000::I've got like you can see my the gutters.
0:28:37.360000 - 0:28:40.360000::I'm like beyond this size 15 feet.
0:28:40.360000 - 0:28:41.360000::What are you doing?
0:28:41.360000 - 0:28:42.360000::My foot.
0:28:42.360000 - 0:28:44.360000::Most of the floor right now is my foot.
0:28:44.360000 - 0:28:45.360000::I'm hanging up space.
0:28:45.360000 - 0:28:46.360000::Sorry Eric.
0:28:46.360000 - 0:28:47.360000::Sorry.
0:28:47.360000 - 0:28:48.360000::Go ahead.
0:28:48.360000 - 0:28:49.360000::Okay.
0:28:49.360000 - 0:28:50.360000::I think this is what's causing me.
0:28:50.360000 - 0:28:51.360000::I think this is something that I really did not know about the artist.
0:28:51.360000 - 0:28:52.360000::Because that's the way the family is going to get you on stage.
0:28:52.360000 - 0:28:58.760000::So the one is when it comes out I'm kind of the sex symbol of the band, whatever, got long ass
0:28:58.760000 - 0:28:59.760000::hair looking great.
0:28:59.760000 - 0:29:00.760000::I'm on vanity fair, whatever.
0:29:00.760000 - 0:29:04.800000::My alcoholism gets so bad by album three that I'm coming on stage trying to wear the
0:29:04.800000 - 0:29:05.800000::same pants.
0:29:05.800000 - 0:29:10.260000::I've got dried up vomit down my, but this is when the albums are the music is cooking,
0:29:10.260000 - 0:29:11.580000::but my health is declining.
0:29:11.580000 - 0:29:12.580000::Yes.
0:29:12.580000 - 0:29:13.520000::And you guys are the same.
0:29:13.520000 - 0:29:17.160000::You kind of went sober and you started having families, and I went off the fucking
0:29:17.160000 - 0:29:19.160000::deep end, starting dating foreign models, and actors, whatever.
0:29:19.160000 - 0:29:20.640000::What do I come back to?
0:29:20.640000 - 0:29:21.640000::I know you die.
0:29:21.640000 - 0:29:23.240000::You are so sad.
0:29:23.240000 - 0:29:24.760000::No, 100% good.
0:29:24.760000 - 0:29:25.600000::I know that.
0:29:25.600000 - 0:29:26.600000::Deathspo.
0:29:26.600000 - 0:29:28.440000::And then we replace you with your son.
0:29:28.440000 - 0:29:30.960000::That's like AC DC with your with your child.
0:29:30.960000 - 0:29:31.960000::Oh, wow.
0:29:31.960000 - 0:29:35.200000::And he has to take over the band and he's and he resets that.
0:29:35.200000 - 0:29:36.200000::He loves it.
0:29:36.200000 - 0:29:38.120000::No, he loved and everyone like loves him so much.
0:29:38.120000 - 0:29:40.920000::He's like the version of you that you could have been, you know.
0:29:40.920000 - 0:29:42.600000::And maybe I'm such an absent father.
0:29:42.600000 - 0:29:46.440000::So absent because I was battling my addictions so intensely.
0:29:46.440000 - 0:29:49.720000::He never got to know me, but like he gets to know me through the classic.
0:29:49.720000 - 0:29:51.200000::It's like style right.
0:29:51.200000 - 0:29:52::Yeah.
0:29:52 - 0:29:53.200000::Kind of a bit of style.
0:29:53.200000 - 0:29:54.800000::A little bit like style.
0:29:54.800000 - 0:29:59.280000::Kind of kill his father so he could bring peace to the galaxy.
0:29:59.280000 - 0:30:00::And then I don't.

0:30:00 - 0:30:03::want to break your heart, but you know what happens next is the same.
0:30:03 - 0:30:05.320000::He falls in your footsteps and he passes away.
0:30:05.320000 - 0:30:07.120000::And then we got to rock out with your grandson.
0:30:07.760000 - 0:30:11.680000::And then you guys started, we got the, we got the freaking nine year old and the 90 year old,
0:30:12.160000 - 0:30:17.080000::two 90 year olds out here making, you know, who knows what that's not a
0:30:17.080000 - 0:30:21.840000::creativity happening between a really, really, really ancient old people and
0:30:21.840000 - 0:30:26::really young people because that's where the transfer of knowledge needs to happen.
0:30:26 - 0:30:28.200000::From 90 year old to teenagers, you know,
0:30:28.200000 - 0:30:31.160000::true. We need to get those people cooking together.
0:30:31.160000 - 0:30:34.720000::And I want to say this about old people too, because I feel like make an effort,
0:30:34.720000 - 0:30:38.400000::y'all, because they're really young people who are falling in love with the
0:30:38.400000 - 0:30:42.640000::greats because there's, I get it, it's easier when you're younger to appreciate
0:30:42.640000 - 0:30:45.360000::the ancient ones because they have so much literature out there.
0:30:45.680000 - 0:30:48.640000::You can really get to know their whole world, follow up with them and jump in.
0:30:49.320000 - 0:30:53.880000::So it's, I know it's going to take a lot of effort to it for our 90 plus listeners
0:30:54.120000 - 0:30:59.320000::to go on a TikTok and to go in the, you know, get up in the club and to go to
0:30:59.320000 - 0:31:02.480000::the skate park. But just try it.
0:31:02.800000 - 0:31:06.160000::Just try reaching a hand down because I want to hear what type of music that
0:31:06.160000 - 0:31:08.560000::would be. I want to see what type of stories they would tell.
0:31:08.960000 - 0:31:12.240000::Right. We got Clint Eastwood out there doing it solo.
0:31:12.240000 - 0:31:15.680000::He's 93, tried direction his own movies, acting on his own shit.
0:31:16.040000 - 0:31:18.160000::It's one of the last to do it like that.
0:31:18.240000 - 0:31:21.440000::And my Nana, who's all are also cooking. She's 92.
0:31:21.600000 - 0:31:22.360000::Is she an artist?
0:31:23.200000 - 0:31:27.560000::She, let's see. She's no, she's not a artist. She was a pharmacist.
0:31:28.640000 - 0:31:36.400000::Okay. What do you think is the biggest factor holding men back from evolving and growing
0:31:36.400000 - 0:31:37.040000::gravity?
0:31:39.040000 - 0:31:41.840000::Because you think we could be tall as if I could fly.
0:31:41.920000 - 0:31:44.440000::Cause you know, gravity is going to flow around all right.
0:31:44.440000 - 0:31:47.240000::Well, for some of y'all, not for me, because that stretch out every day,
0:31:47.240000 - 0:31:51.480000::vertically. Now, what's holding back men specifically to Sostrom?
0:31:52 - 0:31:54.520000::What would you do if you woke up in Yao Ming's body?
0:31:55.560000 - 0:31:57.360000::And Yao Ming's, oh, I did.
0:31:57.360000 - 0:32:00.200000::Goodness. I go to the grocery store. I hit the, yeah.
0:32:00.400000 - 0:32:03.520000::I take some arthritis medicine right when I wake up because you know his joints are
0:32:03.520000 - 0:32:05.040000::aching. Oh my goodness.
0:32:09.120000 - 0:32:11.920000::And that's funny. And then that's a good.
0:32:11.920000 - 0:32:16.360000::Yao Ming was like, asked us to be a permanent member of joy tactics, but he was
0:32:16.360000 - 0:32:17.760000::kind of like dead weight.
0:32:18 - 0:32:22.760000::Which you guys like, you guys have wanted that, which you guys want him on.
0:32:22.760000 - 0:32:25.040000::Like he kind of like disrupted the flow.
0:32:25.040000 - 0:32:26.040000::And like, all right. Yeah.
0:32:26.040000 - 0:32:27.800000::I had no idea what we were talking about.
0:32:27.800000 - 0:32:29.920000::And we kind of like out of frame the whole time.
0:32:29.920000 - 0:32:31.400000::Like, but he's a great hangout.
0:32:31.400000 - 0:32:32.400000::Side of the side.
0:32:32.400000 - 0:32:33.480000::Outside is just nervous.
0:32:33.480000 - 0:32:37.280000::But once and we're trying to like lock into like man, like if you could just be like he
0:32:37.280000 - 0:32:38.760000::is, it's like chilling with us.
0:32:38.760000 - 0:32:40.080000::Getting right. He's so nervous.
0:32:41 - 0:32:42.320000::He's got to hold the basketball.
0:32:43 - 0:32:43.480000::Yeah.
0:32:43.920000 - 0:32:45.680000::How tall is he seven?
0:32:47.400000 - 0:32:48.400000::Yeah. Yeah.
0:32:48.400000 - 0:32:49.600000::Oh my god.
0:32:49.600000 - 0:32:50.600000::That's not a disorder.
0:32:50.600000 - 0:32:58.720000::I want to be a basketball player that that dunks a lot and is really like disrespectful
0:32:58.720000 - 0:32:59.720000::to backboards.
0:33:00.080000 - 0:33:03.520000::Where you're shattering every ball that comes to me.
0:33:03.520000 - 0:33:05.240000::I would perfect this.
0:33:05.240000 - 0:33:09.400000::My whole thing would be everyone's trying to like perfect the three pointer perfect
0:33:09.400000 - 0:33:10.920000::to the their passes or whatever.
0:33:10.920000 - 0:33:14.880000::I would have spent all of my energy to the point where I don't even know how to like
0:33:14.880000 - 0:33:15.720000::dribble it all.
0:33:15.720000 - 0:33:16.240000::Yeah.
0:33:16.240000 - 0:33:16.560000::Yeah.
0:33:16.560000 - 0:33:19.440000::Shattering the backboard every time I touch it.
0:33:19.440000 - 0:33:22.080000::So it would be like, oh god damn.
0:33:22.080000 - 0:33:23.720000::Like the shatter the game.
0:33:23.720000 - 0:33:24.640000::This is Nate on the court.
0:33:24.640000 - 0:33:28.280000::Nate in this scenario, you are 600 pounds and 10 feet tall.
0:33:28.280000 - 0:33:30.560000::And you do not move.
0:33:30.560000 - 0:33:32.360000::You stay the whole game.
0:33:32.360000 - 0:33:32.880000::No.
0:33:32.880000 - 0:33:33.880000::You stay standing.
0:33:33.880000 - 0:33:34.880000::Not golden.
0:33:34.880000 - 0:33:36.920000::Because you get that's illegal.
0:33:36.920000 - 0:33:41.560000::But you're like just past the half court line and you just stand there and you're kind
0:33:41.560000 - 0:33:44.360000::of maybe eating something or drinking a milkshake or something.
0:33:44.360000 - 0:33:45.360000::Just waiting.
0:33:45.360000 - 0:33:49.840000::And then they every once in a while comes you grab it out of the earth and you put everyone
0:33:49.840000 - 0:33:53.040000::out of the way the refs are all too scared to blow the whistle because you're no sensitive.
0:33:53.040000 - 0:33:55.560000::You're so big in tall that your vocal cords don't work.
0:33:55.560000 - 0:33:56.560000::Everybody else is so.
0:33:56.560000 - 0:34:01.040000::It just sounds like barbled like.
0:34:01.040000 - 0:34:03.760000::But you got a custom made Bentley outside that's like huge.
0:34:03.760000 - 0:34:04.760000::It's like huge as a tank.
0:34:04.760000 - 0:34:05.760000::It's sunglasses.
0:34:05.760000 - 0:34:07.760000::And it's big like a rhino.
0:34:07.760000 - 0:34:08.760000::Wow.
0:34:08.760000 - 0:34:09.760000::Huge basketball shorts.
0:34:09.760000 - 0:34:10.760000::But you got in the college.
0:34:10.760000 - 0:34:12.760000::So you got draft from college I get.
0:34:12.760000 - 0:34:13.760000::Right.
0:34:13.760000 - 0:34:14.760000::Of course.
0:34:14.760000 - 0:34:15.760000::You have to get a college to be.
0:34:15.760000 - 0:34:16.760000::No, no, no, not at all.
0:34:16.760000 - 0:34:17.760000::They pick people up.
0:34:17.760000 - 0:34:21.600000::They're scouts that drive around and they just look at the court.
0:34:21.600000 - 0:34:24.800000::So that's why I'm playing on the park street courts all the time.
0:34:24.800000 - 0:34:25.800000::You're crazy.
0:34:25.800000 - 0:34:26.800000::So sweet.
0:34:26.800000 - 0:34:27.800000::Yeah.
0:34:27.800000 - 0:34:31::You want to know how old the oldest college basketball player is right now?
0:34:31 - 0:34:32.800000::Oh, 23.
0:34:32.800000 - 0:34:34.600000::I think 25.
0:34:34.600000 - 0:34:35.600000::I googled that.
0:34:35.600000 - 0:34:36.600000::Ancient.
0:34:36.600000 - 0:34:39.600000::But what's holding men back?
0:34:39.600000 - 0:34:41.600000::It's the freedom to be themselves.
0:34:41.600000 - 0:34:42.600000::Right.
0:34:42.600000 - 0:34:43.600000::And they're ego.
0:34:43.600000 - 0:34:44.600000::Ego.
0:34:44.600000 - 0:34:45.600000::Let your ego.
0:34:45.600000 - 0:34:46.600000::And just give it up.
0:34:46.600000 - 0:34:47.600000::Males.
0:34:47.600000 - 0:34:48.600000::Give it up.
0:34:48.600000 - 0:34:49.600000::You're done.
0:34:49.600000 - 0:34:50.600000::You know what else is.
0:34:50.600000 - 0:34:56.600000::It's a tough question to ask because what's holding men back these days?
0:34:56.600000 - 0:34:57.600000::Everything.
0:34:57.600000 - 0:34:58.600000::Everything.
0:34:58.600000 - 0:34:59.600000::The world.

0:35:00 - 0:35:05.680000::the world, the food we eat is anti-male genetically modified foods quite literally.
0:35:05.680000 - 0:35:11.600000::Quite literally. I mean the road, the speed limits are too slow. There's so many, you know,
0:35:11.600000 - 0:35:19.520000::it could go on and on. Doctors hate us. Hey me. All right. Let's put another question.
0:35:19.520000 - 0:35:26::All right. That was a good, I mean, that was a great question because a lot of people out there
0:35:26 - 0:35:30.880000::are listening to this and they need us to tell them shit like this. And we're hell-of-qualified
0:35:30.880000 - 0:35:37.200000::to speak on. We really are. That. Okay. Let's see here. Do to be in man.
0:35:38.880000 - 0:35:44::If you nut in space, do it, push it backwards. Come on. Hey, be respectful.
0:35:44 - 0:35:51.600000::No, I grow up. What time is that? What time is that? 3647. Cut that out. Hey,
0:35:51.600000 - 0:35:58.240000::we realize we are professionals. By the way, every time you nut, you are in space just because
0:35:58.240000 - 0:36:01.840000::you're near an object that's gravitationally pulling you in. Right. I'm sick of people
0:36:01.840000 - 0:36:08.800000::calling space. Say outer space, please. Okay. Say outer space. Seriously. This is like
0:36:08.800000 - 0:36:14.640000::GG 13. Neil DeGrasse Tyson would school you. He would be so quickly. He would be flipping you
0:36:14.640000 - 0:36:19.440000::like a pancake. I want to give that man more and more money. I want to give him a foot rub.
0:36:19.920000 - 0:36:24.720000::I want to do some things to him. You know, whatever. Give him make him dinner and stuff.
0:36:24.720000 - 0:36:34::Neil DeGrasse, the rock. The rock. Tyson. Is there an authentic self or is the self
0:36:35.200000 - 0:36:43.360000::in illusion? I have so many problems with that question. That is how he's weirded.
0:36:43.360000 - 0:36:49.920000::That's so many problems. Will you please say that one more time actually? Is there an authentic
0:36:49.920000 - 0:36:58.320000::self or is the self in illusion? And I want to say straight up, the self is an illusion. Whatever
0:36:58.320000 - 0:37:04.720000::you think you are, you are not that because guess what? You are just a ball of consciousness.
0:37:04.720000 - 0:37:10.880000::Correct. That has no form to it. You are in a amorphous blob that can change shift and bold.
0:37:10.880000 - 0:37:17.760000::I could be a radical, crazy ass terrorist next week if I really wanted to. People are so
0:37:17.760000 - 0:37:25.040000::obsessed with identity and they are so obsessed with a mask being put on themselves when they
0:37:25.040000 - 0:37:31.600000::are just a blob of nothingness. Well, before we move on, before we get, before we move on,
0:37:32.800000 - 0:37:39.680000::what is authentic? Why are we defining authentic? Is there an authentic self or is it an illusion?
0:37:39.680000 - 0:37:45.760000::How are we defining illusion as well? Because can you have authenticity in the illusory elements
0:37:45.760000 - 0:37:52.560000::of life? Is anything in life not an illusion? Are we defining an illusion as something that
0:37:52.560000 - 0:38:05.760000::doesn't exist according to our century data or are we defining it by what? So that's not a fair
0:38:05.760000 - 0:38:14.080000::question. Authenticity is defined by the self. Nothing is authentic without the approval of the
0:38:14.080000 - 0:38:24.720000::lens of the self. So I wish this one sentence could have could be a four hour. Well, it could
0:38:24.720000 - 0:38:29.680000::be because I don't have I'll be honest. I don't have a point. This is what this is what they're
0:38:29.680000 - 0:38:36.560000::blasting to the prisoners in Guantanamo. If they had a Benzinger chamber. Oh my god.
0:38:36.560000 - 0:38:42.400000::The Benzinger chamber. Where I get to just sit down and have they give me infinite subway and I'll
0:38:42.400000 - 0:38:46.800000::just sit there and eat fucking I'll eat a fucking half buffalo chicken sandwich and a half
0:38:47.760000 - 0:38:53.920000::cold cut with man on a speaker like no I'm right in front of them. Oh, okay, okay, the IRL. Yeah,
0:38:53.920000 - 0:38:58.080000::I'm right there. Yeah, damn. And I'm just telling them the same sentence 25 different ways.
0:38:58.080000 - 0:39:01.840000::And well, that's interesting because that's torture to them. But to some that's that's actually
0:39:01.840000 - 0:39:05.520000::heavy. Well, it's torture if you can't handle it. Right? Hearing something hard,
0:39:05.520000 - 0:39:10.960000::experience something hard. So like a rock. So well, there's a question really the self,
0:39:11.600000 - 0:39:16::the authentic self. I think you have a good point. You're cooking on something as like, is the
0:39:16.720000 - 0:39:19.840000::what is authentic? You know, I'm saying is it authentic to even
0:39:21.760000 - 0:39:25.760000::you know, like whatever. I'm not I don't even want to get I don't even know honestly don't get
0:39:25.760000 - 0:39:29.120000::with that question. Let's go to next question because nobody can answer this because
0:39:29.120000 - 0:39:34.320000::I forgot. Did you talk Hitler out of some stuff? Of course. Some stuff. Sure. Some of the stuff that
0:39:34.320000 - 0:39:38.400000::like I was gonna sit down with him. Do you think that you could have prevented? Because guess what?
0:39:38.400000 - 0:39:43.680000::I threatened people with words. Right. And I could bring up and I'm so sorry to psychic where I
0:39:43.680000 - 0:39:48.160000::could scare him with some stuff I knew about his life, especially coming from the future. Right.
0:39:48.160000 - 0:39:53.120000::Right. And I would be like, your mom is this person she's say, yeah, I'll bring up all his art
0:39:53.120000 - 0:39:57.840000::school failures, whatever and say like, if you don't do what I tell you right now and free
0:39:57.840000 - 0:39:59.840000::everybody and stop going to war right now.

0:40:00 - 0:40:04.100000::Um, I will do something to you Hitler
0:40:10.200000 - 0:40:12.200000::Yeah, I could talk him out of it using a bullet
0:40:15 - 0:40:18.360000::Yeah, I'll give a convincing I'll give the convincing
0:40:21.400000 - 0:40:25.160000::No mercy man, I go K. Y. Jelly wrestler the style of it
0:40:25.160000 - 0:40:27.160000::And
0:40:27.160000 - 0:40:34::Beat his ass the doors get the K. Y. Jelly. K. Y. Jelly out right now the mental the mental kind
0:40:42 - 0:40:46.680000::Bussen body did Hitler have a nice body. Yeah, the angular type. Yeah
0:40:49.160000 - 0:40:51.160000::He probably had a pink penis
0:40:55.160000 - 0:40:57.640000::He now he fucked up for doing all that
0:40:57.640000 - 0:40:59.640000::Yeah, yeah
0:40:59.640000 - 0:41:06.240000::Tank and I gotta if there was if there was somebody there and are in our in our reality that did go back in time and try to talk him out of it
0:41:06.240000 - 0:41:08.240000::Yeah, you fucked up
0:41:08.240000 - 0:41:13.480000::You fucked it up. I know right if we did have you did do it. Well, I guess we're in the reality where Hitler exists
0:41:13.480000 - 0:41:19.040000::Because if they did go back it would create a new fork in time and then they and maybe there would be somebody
0:41:19.040000 - 0:41:25.080000::Because power there's a vacuum for power right and gonna suck up some other loser who wants to be at my life hell
0:41:25.080000 - 0:41:31.700000::Are you saying if Hitler doesn't exist there would be some other type of guy maybe James maybe names James James with Wesley
0:41:31.700000 - 0:41:32.700000::Guthrie
0:41:33.800000 - 0:41:39.800000::What would it take to forgive someone who murdered your best friend? Not a damn thing you got
0:41:39.800000 - 0:41:44::You got it all right, that's all
0:41:44 - 0:41:49::Whatever we'll see you at the say love you say love you my new best friend
0:41:49 - 0:41:53.800000::I guess yeah, no, I don't take it to that extent because I can forgive someone not not rock with them

0:44:08.880000 - 0:44:10.880000::It was a major literally
0:44:10.880000 - 0:44:17.480000::entertaining people entertaining people like us so much. Yes, they do so this is kind of relevant
0:44:17.920000 - 0:44:22.080000::What is the best way to deal with attention that comes with?
0:44:22.640000 - 0:44:24.640000::Fame
0:44:25.440000 - 0:44:33.520000::Think about this question all the time. This is this is something that is happening to us right now and we honestly we need some advice from
0:44:34.200000 - 0:44:38.960000::From you guys you guys and we need to be hanging out with more famous people
0:44:38.960000 - 0:44:42.240000::I know we are coming up with this shit as we go
0:44:42.240000 - 0:44:48.280000::It is humiliating having a podcast where it's like I know that most of our listeners are more successful than us
0:44:48.280000 - 0:44:51.960000::Right entertainment industry that can only say good things about us though
0:44:52.080000 - 0:44:57::Right, we're our peers are actually I just intimidating. I should right intimidating of course, but I
0:44:57.920000 - 0:44:59.920000::Mean how do you deal with pressure?

0:45:00 - 0:45:04.600000::of fame and fortune you just stay grounded man and how do you stay grounded?
0:45:04.600000 - 0:45:11.880000::Stay on your diet, go to the gym, make sure you're posting on social media as
0:45:11.880000 - 0:45:19.440000::much as possible. You know, don't answer, don't answer every text you get.
0:45:19.440000 - 0:45:26.440000::Anybody that is not like kind of at your echelon, just kind of scraping them.
0:45:26.440000 - 0:45:31.840000::They're done. Yeah, it's we're climbing up the ladder. If people say there's a social
0:45:31.840000 - 0:45:36.120000::climbing, no, it's not. This is a business that we're a part of. And if I don't
0:45:36.120000 - 0:45:40.120000::talk to you anymore and you're not kind of like pop in or something like that,
0:45:40.120000 - 0:45:43.320000::like that's just the way it goes. You know what I'm saying? That has nothing to do
0:45:43.320000 - 0:45:47.560000::with social climbing. Because what is the first one? Nothing to me, by the way,
0:45:47.560000 - 0:45:51.040000::if you're not at my level, I don't want to talk to you. I don't want to know
0:45:51.040000 - 0:45:56.040000::anything about your donut. Exactly. In what way? I eat, you know,
0:45:56.040000 - 0:45:59.960000::I don't even care about donuts. Okay, okay, got it. And I'll say this, I do this
0:45:59.960000 - 0:46:03.640000::with the attention. Ignore it. Pretend it's not happening, even though it's
0:46:03.640000 - 0:46:08.640000::happening at a, it's flooding my life. And if someone ever recognizes me on the
0:46:08.640000 - 0:46:11.640000::street, which happens more than I'd cared for even in the suburbs, even in the
0:46:11.640000 - 0:46:15.360000::five year old Italian gentleman, right? They're always coming up saying, whatever I
0:46:15.360000 - 0:46:21::saw, that Twitter video that you did that was my, making me laugh. I tell them this,
0:46:21.640000 - 0:46:26.760000::I think you got me mistaken, brother. That's not me. And if they say yes, it is,
0:46:26.760000 - 0:46:31.320000::I pull them really close and I pull their head right up to my head, don't fucking say
0:46:31.320000 - 0:46:36.920000::a word. I will end you if you tell anybody I was here. I'll keep it private like
0:46:36.920000 - 0:46:43.480000::Bradley Cooper. Eric, do you know the, what happened to George Harrison of the Beatles?
0:46:43.480000 - 0:46:47.640000::He got cancer and died. Well, okay.
0:46:47.640000 - 0:46:53.880000::What else happened? Well, he was living in basically a castle in
0:46:53.880000 - 0:47:00.440000::exorbitant blood. And I foresee a similar type of reality for you where you are
0:47:00.440000 - 0:47:04.920000::living, you have abandoned the creative, creative fields. You are so rich,
0:47:04.920000 - 0:47:08.920000::out of your rich, out of your fucking mind that you can live whatever way you want to.
0:47:08.920000 - 0:47:13.960000::Yeah. But in that castle, some crazy person broken,
0:47:13.960000 - 0:47:18.840000::and he held him at, are you serious? And robbed his ass. And I feel like that.
0:47:18.840000 - 0:47:22.360000::They got John Lennon too with a gun. They were coming after the Beatles and they got a
0:47:22.360000 - 0:47:26.120000::gun in Britain. Oh my god. Oh, because they have old time, he gunned it. I might be
0:47:26.120000 - 0:47:29.720000::misinterpreting this story. I don't know. But this is the way I kind of remember it.
0:47:29.720000 - 0:47:33.800000::You could take over Britain with one gun. They're not right. Oh, yeah. The cops there just have

0:50:26.920000 - 0:50:29.960000::Like to any filmmaker out there that is like,
0:50:29.960000 - 0:50:31.160000::I hate going to movies.

0:50:37.760000 - 0:50:39.760000::I was looking up the people in the movie.
0:50:39.760000 - 0:50:40.720000::I was so curious.
0:50:40.720000 - 0:50:43.240000::That's how in the movie I am as I'm checking the high.
0:50:43.240000 - 0:50:46.200000::No, I was the first movie that I ever felt comfortable
0:50:46.200000 - 0:50:47.960000::like grabbing my phone.
0:50:47.960000 - 0:50:51.640000::It was kind of a fun vibe because everybody was.
0:50:51.640000 - 0:50:52.640000::Yes.
0:50:52.640000 - 0:50:54.520000::We were in a movie theater that had the lights on.
0:50:54.520000 - 0:50:55.840000::Everybody was in this room.
0:50:55.840000 - 0:50:56.680000::I've never seen that.
0:50:56.680000 - 0:50:57.840000::That was the brightest movie.
0:50:57.840000 - 0:50:58.360000::Yeah.
0:50:58.360000 - 0:50:59.360000::That was bizarre.

0:51:00.960000 - 0:51:01.960000::I like that.
0:51:01.960000 - 0:51:02.800000::That's a good style.
0:51:02.800000 - 0:51:04.320000::It's a good business model for a movie theater.
0:51:04.320000 - 0:51:05.160000::It's correct.
0:51:05.160000 - 0:51:07.320000::It's basically living room style where everyone,
0:51:07.320000 - 0:51:09.080000::you know, you could talk, you could be on your phone.
0:51:09.080000 - 0:51:13.280000::The movie's on, but we're not necessarily watching a movie.
0:51:13.280000 - 0:51:14.440000::We're hanging.
0:51:14.440000 - 0:51:15.440000::Right.
0:51:15.440000 - 0:51:16.440000::That's right.
0:51:16.440000 - 0:51:17.440000::Yeah.

0:51:28.200000 - 0:51:29.400000::Oreo milkshake.
0:51:29.400000 - 0:51:30.720000::That was delicious.
0:51:30.720000 - 0:51:32.880000::What happened is I sucked it up through the straw
0:51:32.880000 - 0:51:34.920000::and they had this new thing on top that I'd never had.
0:51:34.920000 - 0:51:39.200000::That was some type of cream cheese type of stuff on top.
0:51:39.200000 - 0:51:41.920000::It's very rare at my age that I get to try new food.
0:51:41.920000 - 0:51:43.320000::That was amazing.
0:51:43.320000 - 0:51:44.560000::Oh, yeah.

0:51:47 - 0:51:51.160000::What brought me joy was Chicago audiences.
0:51:51.160000 - 0:51:52::Oh, yeah.
0:51:52 - 0:51:53.320000::So we did a show.
0:51:53.320000 - 0:51:56.520000::I will say that there is nothing in the world
0:51:56.520000 - 0:52:01.160000::like a Chicago house of people to perform to.
0:52:01.160000 - 0:52:03.960000::Because people in Chicago want to enjoy themselves.
0:52:03.960000 - 0:52:06.960000::And in New York and LA, they just want to be sad,
0:52:06.960000 - 0:52:07.960000::come on and cross.
0:52:07.960000 - 0:52:09.240000::You want to show me what you got?
0:52:09.240000 - 0:52:09.760000::Yeah, right.
0:52:09.760000 - 0:52:11.240000::Shut the fuck.
0:52:11.240000 - 0:52:14.320000::People in Chicago want to have a good time.
0:52:14.320000 - 0:52:16.960000::And they want to laugh and have fun.
0:52:16.960000 - 0:52:19.880000::And when you are cooking for the crowd,
0:52:19.880000 - 0:52:22.760000::there is nothing like that kinetic energy that brings us
0:52:22.760000 - 0:52:26.200000::all together, the live performance that bonds us
0:52:26.200000 - 0:52:30.640000::and makes us all know that we are actually
0:52:30.640000 - 0:52:32.640000::one with everybody.
0:52:32.640000 - 0:52:34.560000::One love, one universal.
0:52:34.560000 - 0:52:36.880000::One of the other universal.
