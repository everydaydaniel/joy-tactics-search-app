0:07:18 - 0:07:20.200000::And because of the muzzle flashes as well. You can look at their stress
0:07:20.200000 - 0:07:22.200000::Just radical
0:07:22.200000 - 0:07:25.080000::On the ground that I think probably has a more information about it
0:07:25.080000 - 0:07:29.920000::But they know better not to talk about his damn Brazilian damn Brazilian was there he was begging somebody to give him a gun
0:07:30.920000 - 0:07:33.960000::That is a great reaction and what is the sick is it a police?
0:07:33.960000 - 0:07:35.960000::I'm just a police officer officer
0:07:37.880000 - 0:07:40.560000::What is Daniel out to these days and Bill Zarian?
0:07:41.200000 - 0:07:45.200000::Are you getting in with Andrew Tate a little bit? Oh, they were going at each other. They were getting an idea
0:07:45.200000 - 0:07:48.680000::Andrew Tate said like he's he's basically a guy that would pay for a prostitute
0:07:48.680000 - 0:07:50.680000::And I'm a guy that owns a prostitute
0:07:51.560000 - 0:07:56.380000::Diabolical top good good. That's a G top G more like top disrespect top
0:07:56.800000 - 0:08:03.160000::We definitely will be 200 years from now 200 years in the past taking orders from him in battle. Oh my god
0:08:03.160000 - 0:08:07.160000::I don't think he would use us. I think we would be but that's here's me
0:08:07.160000 - 0:08:10.520000::He's fucking ordering me around too much middle of night needle right here
0:08:11.480000 - 0:08:13.480000::Needle just a small
0:08:14.200000 - 0:08:19.020000::Interesting good way to kill somebody I know needle as long as hell a long
0:08:22.040000 - 0:08:24.040000::Yeah, I remember that
0:08:24.040000 - 0:08:27.800000::That kid from Terminator is looking busted which one the robot?
0:08:28.680000 - 0:08:32.400000::What's his name he was an American history x-t Charlie x-t on words?
0:08:32.720000 - 0:08:38.520000::Trilik often well, we all know who is Eric. I think that you were a
0:08:38.520000 - 0:08:44.520000::I think you were not leadership, but you were like up there, you know
0:08:44.520000 - 0:08:49.760000::You were like a some sort of sergeant. I don't know what really but I feel like you came from the back of a line
0:08:49.760000 - 0:08:51.760000::What I feel like you are to already
0:08:52.160000 - 0:08:57.080000::But I'm curious what you say because Jack has has determined they determined it for each other
0:08:57.080000 - 0:08:58.840000::Yeah, this is a conversation. I walked into it
0:08:58.840000 - 0:09:00.840000::But I'm very curious interesting
0:09:03.880000 - 0:09:06.560000::I'm trying to think I think it would be like a
0:09:07.560000 - 0:09:11.120000::Like after the Revolutionary War kind of like 18
0:09:11.480000 - 0:09:14.680000::War of 1812 kind of style and
0:09:17.280000 - 0:09:21.680000::You and you I feel like you're like a sergeant that's like put me on the front lines
0:09:22.240000 - 0:09:26.080000::You know what I'm saying and you go to the very front of the line immediately
0:09:27.960000 - 0:09:32.600000::Good war because you know they line them horizontally. Oh, yeah single file war
0:09:32.600000 - 0:09:36.760000::It's just one on one. Yeah
0:09:37.600000 - 0:09:41.800000::They they've tricked him out and they just send one guy out there and like there's probably a million guys behind him
0:09:41.800000 - 0:09:47.920000::Oh, so they put a suit on the back of the Luzzie dude arm like the Michael Jackson
0:09:49.400000 - 0:09:51.400000::We need more illusionists and war
0:09:56.440000 - 0:09:59.980000::Surely through mirrors especially with the landscape and Kabul and the

0:10:00 - 0:10:01.800000::surrounding areas is you could make,
0:10:01.800000 - 0:10:04.280000::because with the mountains, you could make people see you
0:10:04.280000 - 0:10:05.560000::all over the place shining.
0:10:05.560000 - 0:10:06.400000::It's the desert.
0:10:06.400000 - 0:10:07.640000::Don't give me started on Kabul.
0:10:07.640000 - 0:10:08.800000::Shining all over the place?
0:10:08.800000 - 0:10:10.880000::Well, because of the mirrors reflecting, I should say.
0:10:10.880000 - 0:10:13.520000::And the dust particles would generate the 3D images
0:10:13.520000 - 0:10:15::you guys don't know I'm talking about.
0:10:15 - 0:10:16::I do, I do.
0:10:16 - 0:10:16.840000::All right.
0:10:16.840000 - 0:10:20.960000::And I see Jack in like kind of a future war
0:10:20.960000 - 0:10:22.320000::where like your brain is like kind of,
0:10:22.320000 - 0:10:24.600000::you're just like standing like still in the middle of a room
0:10:24.600000 - 0:10:26.360000::and there's like a couple of like all these cords
0:10:26.360000 - 0:10:27.600000::plugged into your brain.
0:10:27.600000 - 0:10:28.440000::Oh.
0:10:28.440000 - 0:10:31::Like it's, it's essentially like war has just turned
0:10:31 - 0:10:32.160000::into like video gaming.
0:10:32.160000 - 0:10:34.560000::But it's an area like controlling like thousands of people
0:10:34.560000 - 0:10:38::out of the single time you're staring in this solitary
0:10:38 - 0:10:40.560000::white room with all these cords and you're fucking head
0:10:40.560000 - 0:10:42.600000::and you're like throwing up and like pissing your pants
0:10:42.600000 - 0:10:44.600000::and shit.
0:10:44.600000 - 0:10:47::See, I see Jack is emaciated.
0:10:47 - 0:10:48.480000::And what is trench foot?
0:10:48.480000 - 0:10:49.280000::Oh, I agree.
0:10:49.280000 - 0:10:53.360000::But I also see tin type world civil war like before and after
0:10:53.360000 - 0:10:56.440000::before smiling after like half your brain's missing.
0:10:56.440000 - 0:10:57.480000::And you know what I mean?
0:10:57.480000 - 0:10:58.320000::I hear it all messy.
0:10:58.320000 - 0:11:00.360000::One time I found a picture from World War One
0:11:00.360000 - 0:11:02.680000::of these guys like marching and there's a guy
0:11:02.680000 - 0:11:05.480000::that was looking at the camera like this.
0:11:05.480000 - 0:11:06.480000::And it's in a cassette.
0:11:06.480000 - 0:11:07.480000::I was shocked.
0:11:07.480000 - 0:11:09.480000::Yeah, I sent it to Jack and I was like, that'd be you.
0:11:09.480000 - 0:11:10.480000::I'd be confused.
0:11:10.480000 - 0:11:13.840000::I would get, I would maybe do something good on accident.
0:11:13.840000 - 0:11:16.520000::But I can't imagine I'd be good for anything.
0:11:16.520000 - 0:11:17.520000::Definitely.
0:11:17.520000 - 0:11:18.720000::World War One tall body.
0:11:18.720000 - 0:11:19.720000::Yeah.
0:11:19.720000 - 0:11:20.720000::You're always hunched over.
0:11:20.720000 - 0:11:21.720000::Freshly tenant.
0:11:21.720000 - 0:11:22.720000::Look over the fence.
0:11:22.720000 - 0:11:23.720000::There they are.
0:11:23.720000 - 0:11:24.720000::Mm-hmm.
0:11:24.720000 - 0:11:27.560000::Remember the potato masher grenades?
0:11:27.560000 - 0:11:28.560000::No.
0:11:28.560000 - 0:11:30.080000::You don't know this is German grenades.
0:11:30.080000 - 0:11:32.080000::Oh.
0:11:32.080000 - 0:11:33.920000::Those are fucking out of the potatoes.
0:11:33.920000 - 0:11:34.920000::Yeah.
0:11:34.920000 - 0:11:39.280000::And Eric was determined to be like early invasion a rack.
0:11:39.280000 - 0:11:40.120000::Yeah.
0:11:40.120000 - 0:11:41.120000::Oh, for sure.
0:11:41.120000 - 0:11:42.120000::First time.
0:11:42.120000 - 0:11:43.120000::You can see him in 9-11.
0:11:43.120000 - 0:11:44.120000::I might get me wherever we're going.
0:11:44.120000 - 0:11:45.120000::I'm smiling.
0:11:45.120000 - 0:11:46.120000::Yeah.
0:11:46.120000 - 0:11:48.120000::You were the first Metro sexual to hit our eye.
0:11:48.120000 - 0:11:52.120000::Oh, with the V-neck on the fucking backhand.
0:11:52.120000 - 0:11:53.120000::Digital camera.
0:11:53.120000 - 0:11:54.120000::From it.
0:11:54.120000 - 0:11:56.120000::So like, you see Sikaria?
0:11:56.120000 - 0:11:57.120000::Oh, yeah.
0:11:57.120000 - 0:11:58.120000::Yeah, yeah.
0:11:58.120000 - 0:12:00.240000::You know, when they are speaking in Spanish,
0:12:00.240000 - 0:12:02.280000::and they're just like such an American accent,
0:12:02.280000 - 0:12:03.520000::like I love one.
0:12:03.520000 - 0:12:06.680000::You hear like American soldiers doing that in a rack.
0:12:06.680000 - 0:12:08.360000::Like, duck-a-patat.
0:12:08.360000 - 0:12:09.680000::Whatever they say.
0:12:09.680000 - 0:12:11.320000::Whatever the language is being.
0:12:11.320000 - 0:12:12.320000::Right.
0:12:12.320000 - 0:12:14.080000::It's Arabic is a gorgeous language.
0:12:14.080000 - 0:12:15.160000::I'll just say that.
0:12:15.160000 - 0:12:17.200000::Because you know, they're saying stuff that is so beautiful
0:12:17.200000 - 0:12:19.080000::to each other and so sweet.
0:12:19.080000 - 0:12:20.920000::That we just don't do in America.
0:12:20.920000 - 0:12:22.560000::It's just so sweet shit.
0:12:22.560000 - 0:12:23.920000::Women are gorgeous.
0:12:23.920000 - 0:12:24.920000::Absolutely beautiful.
0:12:24.920000 - 0:12:25.920000::Across the country.
0:12:25.920000 - 0:12:26.920000::Across the world.
0:12:26.920000 - 0:12:27.920000::Across the women.
0:12:27.920000 - 0:12:28.920000::Stay being beautiful.
0:12:28.920000 - 0:12:30.920000::And yet, I agree.
0:12:30.920000 - 0:12:32.920000::Absolutely beautiful.
0:12:32.920000 - 0:12:34.920000::Beautiful people.
0:12:34.920000 - 0:12:35.920000::It's wonderful.
0:12:35.920000 - 0:12:38.280000::Looking at it, I really can't believe this.
0:12:38.280000 - 0:12:40.720000::If I was God, I wouldn't have, you're telling me,
0:12:40.720000 - 0:12:43.400000::every single person looked completely different from another.
0:12:43.400000 - 0:12:44.400000::That's what they want us to believe.
0:12:44.400000 - 0:12:46.920000::They could be no way that this is true.
0:12:46.920000 - 0:12:47.920000::Really?
0:12:47.920000 - 0:12:48.920000::No.
0:12:48.920000 - 0:12:49.920000::You know what?
0:12:49.920000 - 0:12:52::I was out of giant bonfire one time in Pennsylvania
0:12:52 - 0:12:54.120000::around a bunch of strangers and somebody came up to me
0:12:54.120000 - 0:12:55.440000::with a video camera and said,
0:12:55.440000 - 0:12:58.560000::what the fuck you look exactly like me?
0:12:58.560000 - 0:13:00.400000::And I never saw him again.
0:13:00.400000 - 0:13:01.400000::Did you?
0:13:01.400000 - 0:13:02.400000::Did I look like him?
0:13:02.400000 - 0:13:04.120000::Probably, but I don't know.
0:13:04.120000 - 0:13:05.640000::Probably a little.
0:13:05.640000 - 0:13:09.800000::What were Conor being?
0:13:09.800000 - 0:13:10.800000::This is my question.
0:13:10.800000 - 0:13:11.800000::This is my presumption.
0:13:11.800000 - 0:13:12.800000::OK.
0:13:12.800000 - 0:13:13.800000::There's a new one.
0:13:13.800000 - 0:13:14.300000::OK.
0:13:14.300000 - 0:13:16.960000::And I've thought this about you, but now I'm thinking about you.
0:13:16.960000 - 0:13:20.480000::I think you were the first ever war individual.
0:13:20.480000 - 0:13:21.640000::There was no such thing as war.
0:13:21.640000 - 0:13:23.840000::And then you probably came along.
0:13:23.840000 - 0:13:26.560000::Before there was any language, first ever war,
0:13:26.560000 - 0:13:27.560000::except the war.
0:13:27.560000 - 0:13:28.640000::But what considers a war then?
0:13:28.640000 - 0:13:29.960000::You're like half-nie underthol.
0:13:29.960000 - 0:13:31.240000::You are Erikai.
0:13:31.240000 - 0:13:32.240000::What is your core?
0:13:32.240000 - 0:13:34.560000::You consider a war considered a war that is too bad against war?
0:13:34.560000 - 0:13:35.840000::No, because it's got to be for a reason,
0:13:35.840000 - 0:13:36.840000::a half.
0:13:36.840000 - 0:13:38.960000::Well, it's got to be for properties over what?
0:13:38.960000 - 0:13:40.840000::2001 space situation.
0:13:40.840000 - 0:13:41.640000::What was that?
0:13:41.640000 - 0:13:45.320000::Space situation.
0:13:45.320000 - 0:13:47.360000::2001, a space situation.
0:13:47.360000 - 0:13:49.280000::2001, a space situation.
0:13:49.280000 - 0:13:51.080000::A space-yield situation.
0:13:51.080000 - 0:13:53.120000::Yeah, I can see you in that type of scenario.
0:13:53.120000 - 0:13:54.040000::Where there's no gravity.
0:13:54.040000 - 0:13:55.080000::Is there a gravity in the beginning
0:13:55.080000 - 0:13:56.200000::when those monkeys are doing their thing?
0:13:56.200000 - 0:13:57.400000::There is definitely gravity.
0:13:57.400000 - 0:13:57.920000::Oh, yeah.
0:13:57.920000 - 0:13:58.760000::There's different formulas.
0:13:58.760000 - 0:14:00.200000::I guess I just saw space in the background
0:14:00.200000 - 0:14:04.240000::and I assumed that it was an anti-gravity zone.
0:14:04.240000 - 0:14:06.080000::Couldn't you see Conor as Erikai?
0:14:06.080000 - 0:14:07.120000::Who is this?
0:14:07.120000 - 0:14:10.600000::This is Laura Lurings, fucking Sauromont's crazy ass army,
0:14:10.600000 - 0:14:13.720000::where all the other orcs are weak and fucking malnourished.
0:14:13.720000 - 0:14:16.120000::But then they have a special breed of orcs.
0:14:16.120000 - 0:14:17.680000::Wait, is that the one that is?

0:15:46.880000 - 0:15:47.880000::Do you hear me?
0:15:47.880000 - 0:15:50.400000::No, I can't because of people who guessed it.
0:15:50.400000 - 0:15:54.040000::But he tried to print out the entirety of millfunture.com.
0:15:54.040000 - 0:15:57.840000::And then he saw that it was like 48 pages.
0:15:57.840000 - 0:16:00.440000::Printed the first page and then stopped it.
0:16:00.440000 - 0:16:03.600000::And then his parents got home and printed something out.

0:16:09.880000 - 0:16:10.880000::Oh.
0:16:10.880000 - 0:16:13.760000::That's also not a public individual.
0:16:13.760000 - 0:16:14.760000::Nope, nope.
0:16:14.760000 - 0:16:16.280000::And he's an amazing guy.
0:16:16.280000 - 0:16:17.280000::And this is a podcast.
0:16:17.280000 - 0:16:18.120000::So, shout out.
0:16:18.120000 - 0:16:18.960000::Yeah.

0:16:22.240000 - 0:16:24.280000::I've talked to Jack about this one.
0:16:24.280000 - 0:16:27.440000::This should be given to teachers who are
0:16:27.440000 - 0:16:32.320000::about to go and teach learning disabled people.
0:16:32.320000 - 0:16:38::Because there's a former LRP, full blown dyslexic learning
0:16:38 - 0:16:39.320000::disabled person.
0:16:39.320000 - 0:16:43.920000::It resembles questions that were had little learning resource
0:16:43.920000 - 0:16:47.760000::program in high school, which also everybody would call LRP,
0:16:47.760000 - 0:16:49.840000::which stands for little, our word people.
0:16:49.840000 - 0:16:51.920000::Oh, yeah, that's what they would say.
0:16:51.920000 - 0:16:53.920000::And everybody who's podcast name is dropped.
0:16:53.920000 - 0:16:55.120000::Everyone was proud of it.
0:16:55.120000 - 0:16:56.400000::Everyone was happy about it.
0:16:56.400000 - 0:17:00.840000::And if you could, if you, this is what it is like to be a
0:17:00.840000 - 0:17:03.800000::dyslexic person is incredibly hard to, if I have to fill
0:17:03.800000 - 0:17:06.280000::an application online, I'd rather kill myself.
0:17:06.280000 - 0:17:08.240000::I don't want to have to think about words or anything like that.
0:17:08.240000 - 0:17:10.880000::See, your dyslexia makes me think, because I'm like,
0:17:10.880000 - 0:17:13.600000::I think I have a little bit of dyslexia, but I don't have
0:17:13.600000 - 0:17:15.880000::like the full blown whatever you got.
0:17:15.880000 - 0:17:17.640000::Like you have it, you have it ramped up.
0:17:17.640000 - 0:17:20.240000::Like you got the full blown, you got the 100% dyslexia.
0:17:20.240000 - 0:17:21.040000::100%.
0:17:21.040000 - 0:17:21.880000::Yeah.
0:17:21.880000 - 0:17:23.880000::100% Irish, 100% dyslexia.
0:17:23.880000 - 0:17:25.080000::That's a difference.
0:17:25.080000 - 0:17:27.320000::That's a good soldier right there.
0:17:27.320000 - 0:17:29.040000::I'll do anything.
0:17:29.040000 - 0:17:33.080000::That's, I think I would definitely, everybody here would be
0:17:33.080000 - 0:17:36.080000::murdered in the first like three minutes of a whole year.
0:17:36.080000 - 0:17:37.080000::No question.
0:17:37.080000 - 0:17:38.080000::And I have no ounce of bravery in me.
0:17:38.080000 - 0:17:39.080000::No.
0:17:39.080000 - 0:17:40.800000::So I'm being murdered in the back because I'm running away
0:17:40.800000 - 0:17:42.040000::from the frontline.
0:17:42.040000 - 0:17:43.040000::You know what I mean?
0:17:43.040000 - 0:17:44.640000::Yeah, I'd probably die before it all happened because I wouldn't
0:17:44.640000 - 0:17:46.360000::be sleeping and I'd have a stroke.
0:17:46.360000 - 0:17:48.560000::I would definitely die in basic training.
0:17:48.560000 - 0:17:50.360000::Because that's like a half year hard.
0:17:50.360000 - 0:17:51.360000::You get mud infection.
0:17:51.360000 - 0:17:52.360000::Yeah.
0:17:52.360000 - 0:17:53.360000::A mud?
0:17:53.360000 - 0:17:54.360000::Yeah.
0:17:54.360000 - 0:17:57.640000::That's the story of a friend that I have that did basic training.
0:17:57.640000 - 0:17:58.640000::Hell yeah.
0:17:58.640000 - 0:18:03.480000::He is a, okay, this is a good friend of mine and he went through
0:18:03.480000 - 0:18:04.480000::basic training.
0:18:04.480000 - 0:18:08.800000::He did the National Guard and he described that like in basic
0:18:08.800000 - 0:18:10.280000::training, you can't jack off.
0:18:10.280000 - 0:18:12.800000::I mean, you can, I guess, but I think it's really hard to.
0:18:12.800000 - 0:18:13.800000::Yeah.
0:18:13.800000 - 0:18:16.320000::So I think you're there for like a couple of months.
0:18:16.320000 - 0:18:21.480000::And so for three months or so, he had like saved up his, his
0:18:21.480000 - 0:18:22.480000::nut.
0:18:22.480000 - 0:18:24.400000::And he told me that.
0:18:24.400000 - 0:18:28::And he's like, he was like, when I jerked off, it was like a
0:18:28 - 0:18:30.400000::seven, he said he called it a 17 roper.
0:18:30.400000 - 0:18:33.160000::Oh, I didn't like it.
0:18:33.160000 - 0:18:35.400000::He also have some other friends for it.
0:18:35.400000 - 0:18:38.400000::Like, epic jack off session or something?
0:18:38.400000 - 0:18:39.400000::I don't think so.
0:18:39.400000 - 0:18:40.400000::Oh, this might be something.
0:18:40.400000 - 0:18:41.400000::That is something.
0:18:41.400000 - 0:18:44.320000::He just called it like a roper and I'd never heard that term
0:18:44.320000 - 0:18:45.320000::roper.
0:18:45.320000 - 0:18:47.880000::And it was like every kind of like, oh, yeah, I know what I mean.
0:18:47.880000 - 0:18:48.880000::I know what I mean.
0:18:48.880000 - 0:18:49.880000::You know, I could imagine.
0:18:49.880000 - 0:18:51.880000::I was like, god damn, and he was like, some of it was like, this
0:18:51.880000 - 0:18:54.960000::dress, but it's like some of it was like discolored and like dead.
0:18:54.960000 - 0:18:56.680000::Oh, no, that's the boss.
0:18:56.680000 - 0:18:57.680000::I don't think that.
0:18:57.680000 - 0:18:59.200000::Oh, well, I think about this lately.

0:33:26.640000 - 0:33:28.640000::Of course he could.

0:34:22.600000 - 0:34:23.600000::It's true.
0:34:23.600000 - 0:34:29.600000::He went over in 2014 and he sat at a computer chair in the city square in the promenade.
0:34:29.600000 - 0:34:30.600000::He set up the face for four months.
0:34:30.600000 - 0:34:31.600000::I don't even know if he was two.
0:34:31.600000 - 0:34:32.600000::Four months.
0:34:32.600000 - 0:34:37.600000::He logged on a runescape, got a couple kills, got out, took a hot bottom flight to fucking...
0:34:37.600000 - 0:34:40.600000::He basically chilled with his friends.
0:34:40.600000 - 0:34:42.600000::Basically got a second city boat to Afghanistan.
0:34:42.600000 - 0:34:44.600000::For people who don't know...
0:34:44.600000 - 0:34:46.600000::For people who don't know without a reference.
0:34:46.600000 - 0:34:52.600000::The second city is a theater in America which many comedic legends have spawned quite...
0:34:52.600000 - 0:34:53.600000::Bill Murray, Jason Cedacus.
0:34:53.600000 - 0:34:54.600000::Bill Murray, Jason Cedacus.
0:34:54.600000 - 0:34:55.600000::No, a very...
0:34:55.600000 - 0:34:56.600000::A very few allegations.
0:34:56.600000 - 0:34:57.600000::A very few allegations.
0:34:57.600000 - 0:34:58.600000::What?
0:34:58.600000 - 0:34:59.600000::What?

0:35:00 - 0:35:11::Well, actually, I would like to point out that also I was, you know, I was, I'm hardcore playground guy.
0:35:11 - 0:35:14::Oh, and the bug got shot up to the bug house.
0:35:14 - 0:35:17::Jason, today he's.
0:35:17 - 0:35:19::He's this.
0:35:19 - 0:35:22::Wait, can you tell the magician's story from your boat?
0:35:22 - 0:35:25::Oh, well, yeah, you've all heard this, but I tell them.
0:35:25 - 0:35:26::I feel like you have a chair this.
0:35:26 - 0:35:27::This is really funny.
0:35:27 - 0:35:30::I think I might cruise ship for some sort of Connor years and years ago.
0:35:30 - 0:35:31::We have shared culture.
0:35:31 - 0:35:32::We have a very.
0:35:32 - 0:35:34::Wait, let's describe this for a second.
0:35:34 - 0:35:38::Like the, the, the second city boat is like a paid gig.
0:35:38 - 0:35:42::She's one of the only paid comedy gigs in Chicago.
0:35:42 - 0:35:43::Yeah.
0:35:43 - 0:35:47::And it's really good money like for more than main stage, right?
0:35:47 - 0:35:48::I think so.
0:35:48 - 0:35:55::Yeah, I was getting like a thousand a week pretext, which when I was 20, three or four when I did that, I was like, good God.
0:35:55 - 0:35:56::Yeah, I mean, fucking.
0:35:56 - 0:35:58::They think you make 800 a week.
0:35:58 - 0:36:00::They fucked you guys show.
0:36:00 - 0:36:01::God damn.
0:36:01 - 0:36:07::But the, it's like a really big payday for there's no, there's absolutely no paid opportunities in Chicago.
0:36:07 - 0:36:09::There's like a couple of them.
0:36:09 - 0:36:10::Yeah.
0:36:10 - 0:36:17::One of them is a second city boat where you get on a ship and you're there for like three months and you're doing like shows for four months.
0:36:17 - 0:36:20::And you're doing shows like eight.
0:36:20 - 0:36:23::Like eight shows a week, ten shows a week or something like that.
0:36:23 - 0:36:24::Yeah, you live on the ship.
0:36:24 - 0:36:28::You get off and port like, you know, one tip, uh, whatever you,
0:36:28 - 0:36:29::it depends.
0:36:29 - 0:36:33::Sometimes you're at sea for a few days and then you, uh, then you stop off a NASA,
0:36:33 - 0:36:34::a NASA bomb.
0:36:34 - 0:36:35::A NASA bomb.
0:36:35 - 0:36:36::Yeah.
0:36:36 - 0:36:39::And I didn't know Connor back then, but when was your boat?
0:36:39 - 0:36:40::2016.
0:36:40 - 0:36:43::Maybe we met right after 2011.
0:36:43 - 0:36:44::Wow.
0:36:44 - 0:36:51::But people would always say like people on my ship who had been doing cruises for ten years, like reference you calling a floating prison.
0:36:51 - 0:36:52::Really?
0:36:52 - 0:36:53::Oh, yeah.
0:36:53 - 0:36:54::I remember I heard that.
0:36:54 - 0:36:58::They would say they would credit someone was like a Connor called it a floating prison.
0:36:58 - 0:36:59::Yeah.
0:36:59 - 0:37:02::I mean, really, you can't get off your lockdown.
0:37:02 - 0:37:04::You're never sleeping on dry land.
0:37:04 - 0:37:05::You're always in.
0:37:05 - 0:37:08::Yeah, guys, that's how bad the prison system is in America.
0:37:08 - 0:37:09::It's a cruise ship.
0:37:09 - 0:37:10::Nice.
0:37:10 - 0:37:12::Well, I'm doing a privilege moment call out.
0:37:12 - 0:37:13::Thank you very much.
0:37:13 - 0:37:14::So we,
0:37:14 - 0:37:16::bikers did have a, they had like a float.
0:37:16 - 0:37:19::Oh, I saw that on the whole hospital bone, right?
0:37:19 - 0:37:20::Really?
0:37:20 - 0:37:23::It's like an old British boat that was prison.
0:37:23 - 0:37:24::I wouldn't, I wouldn't.
0:37:24 - 0:37:25::I wouldn't.
0:37:25 - 0:37:26::I wouldn't ask for the boat.
0:37:26 - 0:37:27::I'm not going to make a lot of prisons.
0:37:27 - 0:37:33::But so here's what happened in Connor, Connor test they bring on entertainers every week or two to like, you know,
0:37:33 - 0:37:34::just entertainer.
0:37:34 - 0:37:35::Guess explain status.
0:37:35 - 0:37:36::What's that?
0:37:36 - 0:37:37::She explains status on the ship.
0:37:37 - 0:37:38::Yeah.
0:37:38 - 0:37:44::Which is it's every, it's kind of like a naval organization where it's really important.
0:37:44 - 0:37:46::If you're an officer, you live in a different place.
0:37:47 - 0:37:50::If you, you know, I met people that were like, I don't see daylight.
0:37:50 - 0:37:51::Like, I'm like, oh yeah.
0:37:51 - 0:37:52::Underneath here all day.
0:37:52 - 0:37:56::And I have like 15 kids, 18 years old and from the Philippines.
0:37:56 - 0:37:59::And they can pay them way less because they have their flag.
0:37:59 - 0:38:02::Their flag shape is based in like the Bahamas.
0:38:02 - 0:38:06::So the, the, the, they're paying people fucking peanuts.
0:38:06 - 0:38:11::But second city got guest entertainer status, which means that you can go everywhere.
0:38:11 - 0:38:12::The crew can go.
0:38:12 - 0:38:14::You have to wear an ID.
0:38:15 - 0:38:19::But when you leave that and you go into the guest area, you become a guest.
0:38:19 - 0:38:20::You take it off.
0:38:20 - 0:38:25::And so, and it would be horrible because you have it off and they're so nice to you.
0:38:25 - 0:38:26::The workers are so nice to you.
0:38:26 - 0:38:29::And then they realize that you're a, oh, also a worker.
0:38:29 - 0:38:33::And it's just like, guess entertainer that it becomes so resentful fairly.
0:38:33 - 0:38:34::Yes.
0:38:34 - 0:38:35::I felt that so much.
0:38:35 - 0:38:40::It was like, sorry, tipping them as much as I could because walking on feeling guilty as fuck all the time.
0:38:41 - 0:38:45::But they would bring on like comedians for a couple nights or magicians, which is where the story is.
0:38:45 - 0:38:48::And then the story that Nate has alluded to is going.
0:38:48 - 0:38:53::And so they bring in this on this guy where it was a two week cruise to the port.
0:38:53 - 0:38:55::We went to Puerto Rico is one of the stops.
0:38:55 - 0:38:57::What the Rico memory and Trump was in that.
0:38:57 - 0:38:59::Oh, oh, when he goes, I don't want to remember that.
0:38:59 - 0:39:00::I don't know.
0:39:00 - 0:39:01::Yeah, don't dignify.
0:39:01 - 0:39:02::I was supposed to.
0:39:02 - 0:39:03::So they have.
0:39:03 - 0:39:08::They had like, we would go see all of these guys entertainers because we were so bored.
0:39:09 - 0:39:13::See every comedian, every magician, every like, yeah, they brought out.
0:39:13 - 0:39:14::Well, secular.
0:39:14 - 0:39:15::And a crazy secular.
0:39:15 - 0:39:18::No, no, no, no, no, from fucking Siberia.
0:39:18 - 0:39:21::Oh, whoa, they have that.
0:39:21 - 0:39:24::They didn't even need a mic.
0:39:24 - 0:39:28::You're just resonating through the great fruit lady shout out.
0:39:28 - 0:39:29::So this magician's coming on.
0:39:29 - 0:39:31::I'm excited because I can see his poster.
0:39:31 - 0:39:33::They're like advertising it.
0:39:33 - 0:39:35::And it's clearly from 1994.
0:39:35 - 0:39:37::And he's like coming out of like a treasure chest.
0:39:37 - 0:39:40::And he has like hoops on his arms and like cards like this.
0:39:40 - 0:39:45::And he has like a little, you know, like what they call the vest when you were in this.
0:39:45 - 0:39:46::Highly.
0:39:46 - 0:39:48::Yeah, just a regular suit vest, whatever.
0:39:48 - 0:39:49::So excited.
0:39:49 - 0:39:54::But then the night before we get some tea from the entertainment coordinator who we were friends with.
0:39:54 - 0:39:58::And she was like, this guy came on last night from Puerto Rico.
0:39:58 - 0:40:00::He got fucked up in San Luis.

0:40:00 - 0:40:03.360000::like black out drunk cause problems getting on the ship
0:40:03.360000 - 0:40:05.800000::and then called her in the morning and was like,
0:40:05.800000 - 0:40:08.160000::I'm so sick, like I became really sick,
0:40:08.160000 - 0:40:09.760000::I can't do the show and she's like,
0:40:09.760000 - 0:40:12.160000::I've seen the footage, I heard reports,
0:40:12.160000 - 0:40:14.800000::I know you were fucking drunk as hell last night.
0:40:14.800000 - 0:40:18.640000::You have to, this guy's like 58, like almost 60.
0:40:18.640000 - 0:40:20.240000::She's like, if you don't do the show tonight
0:40:20.240000 - 0:40:21.440000::because they were counting on it,
0:40:21.440000 - 0:40:23.920000::you were never gonna work on a Norwegian cruise again.
0:40:23.920000 - 0:40:27.840000::And so he had to do it, like devastatingly hung over.
0:40:28 - 0:40:31.680000::And so we go into the show, which is a very sparsely attended
0:40:31.680000 - 0:40:33.360000::with the knowledge that this guy is like,
0:40:33.360000 - 0:40:37.280000::really fucking next level hung over at about 60 years old.
0:40:37.280000 - 0:40:40.320000::And he comes out, he comes out from backstage,
0:40:40.320000 - 0:40:44.960000::his shirt's a little untucked, he's like sweating already,
0:40:44.960000 - 0:40:47.200000::he's been sweating backstage.
0:40:47.200000 - 0:40:52.400000::He's doing tricks that he has done for probably 20 years.
0:40:52.400000 - 0:40:55.200000::And I was crying laughing the whole time.
0:40:55.200000 - 0:40:59.280000::And one of the parts he like gets to audience members,
0:40:59.280000 - 0:41:01.760000::clearly is looking for the least heavy person
0:41:01.760000 - 0:41:03.280000::the audience put on his shoulders.
0:41:03.280000 - 0:41:05.920000::So he finds this poor old Asian grandma
0:41:05.920000 - 0:41:07.520000::who doesn't speak English clearly.
0:41:07.520000 - 0:41:10.720000::He gets her, he gets, pulls her, it's like, I want you.
0:41:10.720000 - 0:41:12.880000::She's not understanding what he's saying.
0:41:12.880000 - 0:41:17.280000::He puts her on his shoulders and then hops on a unicycle.
0:41:17.280000 - 0:41:18.960000::And the ship was like rocking.
0:41:18.960000 - 0:41:20.480000::Yeah.
0:41:20.480000 - 0:41:22::He's on with his like frail.
0:41:22 - 0:41:24.960000::He's also like a 2000 seat theater.
0:41:24.960000 - 0:41:26.400000::It's a huge theater.
0:41:26.400000 - 0:41:28.080000::And there's probably 75 people.
0:41:28.080000 - 0:41:29.880000::Like nobody's home.
0:41:29.880000 - 0:41:33.840000::And this like grandma's on his back, the ship's rocking.
0:41:33.840000 - 0:41:36.440000::And you can see him like trying to like go.
0:41:36.440000 - 0:41:38.160000::And the wheel is a little deflated.
0:41:38.160000 - 0:41:39.600000::Maybe that's on purpose to keep.
0:41:39.600000 - 0:41:41.520000::But it looks so dangerous.
0:41:41.520000 - 0:41:43.080000::And he's like, you can hear him grunting.
0:41:43.080000 - 0:41:44.640000::We're like right up front.
0:41:44.640000 - 0:41:47.440000::And then finally he gets her off and people clap.
0:41:47.440000 - 0:41:49.680000::And he's like making fucking racist jokes.
0:41:49.680000 - 0:41:52.080000::And then he like feels the back of his neck.
0:41:52.080000 - 0:41:54.240000::And he's like, man, my neck's all wet.
0:41:55.520000 - 0:41:57.520000::Piss from from her.
0:41:57.520000 - 0:41:59.680000::No, I think he was saying like he was like turned on.
0:41:59.680000 - 0:42:00.800000::And she didn't get what he's saying.
0:42:00.800000 - 0:42:02.240000::So she's like laughing and clapping.
0:42:02.240000 - 0:42:04.160000::And it was just like hell.
0:42:04.160000 - 0:42:08.320000::And then his last trick is that he made it into a positive.
0:42:08.320000 - 0:42:08.800000::Is what you're saying?
0:42:08.800000 - 0:42:09.760000::I guess a lot.
0:42:09.760000 - 0:42:10.280000::That's correct.
0:42:10.280000 - 0:42:11.280000::He enjoyed his day work.
0:42:11.280000 - 0:42:12::Flip into a positive.
0:42:12 - 0:42:14.240000::And the last set back to set up.
0:42:14.240000 - 0:42:17.520000::The last thing he does is he got got one of the he didn't have
0:42:17.520000 - 0:42:18.560000::like a stock assistant.
0:42:18.560000 - 0:42:21.920000::So he used this a poor like 21 year old guy from the Philippines.
0:42:21.920000 - 0:42:22.880000::The business assistant.
0:42:22.960000 - 0:42:25.520000::And what they do is they like throw a machine.
0:42:25.520000 - 0:42:28::He's on a ladder walking around like this, you know?
0:42:28.800000 - 0:42:31.280000::He's so sweaty, so out of breath.
0:42:31.280000 - 0:42:33.760000::And they're throwing up machetes and he's catching them in his teeth.
0:42:33.760000 - 0:42:36.400000::And he gets to the top of the ladder and he goes like he does.
0:42:36.400000 - 0:42:37.360000::What the hell?
0:42:37.360000 - 0:42:39.520000::You know that joke from like 2000?
0:42:39.520000 - 0:42:40.240000::Nobody laughs.
0:42:42.160000 - 0:42:43.200000::He's throwing the machete.
0:42:43.200000 - 0:42:45.600000::The kid throws the first machete up and he drops it.
0:42:45.600000 - 0:42:47.040000::And the guy gets legit mad.
0:42:49.600000 - 0:42:51.040000::And you can see him like calm out.
0:42:51.920000 - 0:42:53.600000::And then he finally gets a machete in the mouth.
0:42:53.600000 - 0:42:55.040000::I feel like I do that a lot.
0:42:55.040000 - 0:42:55.520000::What?
0:42:55.520000 - 0:42:58.320000::Like I'm not mad like publicly.
0:42:58.320000 - 0:42:59.120000::Yeah.
0:42:59.120000 - 0:43:00::That's fine.
0:43:00 - 0:43:00.800000::Yeah.
0:43:00.800000 - 0:43:01.280000::Yeah.
0:43:01.280000 - 0:43:01.760000::That's really fine.
0:43:01.760000 - 0:43:02.240000::Oh well.
0:43:02.240000 - 0:43:04.320000::Who are you doing that to your assistants?
0:43:04.320000 - 0:43:05.760000::Yeah, my army of assistants.
0:43:06.560000 - 0:43:07.200000::How are they?
0:43:07.200000 - 0:43:08.880000::I did make the alcohol story.
0:43:08.880000 - 0:43:10.400000::It didn't make me think I was thinking about this today.
0:43:10.400000 - 0:43:13.360000::You know how like in the 1800s, if you had a problem,
0:43:13.360000 - 0:43:15.600000::you could just go straight to the White House and wait in the lobby.
0:43:15.600000 - 0:43:16.080000::No.
0:43:16.080000 - 0:43:17.120000::President came out.
0:43:17.120000 - 0:43:17.600000::Really?
0:43:17.600000 - 0:43:19.680000::Yeah, and be like, hey man, I was supposed to get this
0:43:19.680000 - 0:43:21.120000::fucking water heater.
0:43:21.120000 - 0:43:23.200000::But my neighbor said, no, can you sign this thing?
0:43:23.200000 - 0:43:23.920000::Yeah, yeah, yeah, here.
0:43:23.920000 - 0:43:24.720000::And they would like sign it.
0:43:24.720000 - 0:43:27.280000::Like that was like up for a long time.
0:43:27.280000 - 0:43:28.240000::They let them do that.
0:43:28.240000 - 0:43:29.280000::And I think they should bring it back.
0:43:29.280000 - 0:43:31.520000::But for only with guys who got DUIs.
0:43:31.520000 - 0:43:33.040000::And they can stay in the lobby.
0:43:33.040000 - 0:43:34.960000::And they got to get Biden to like, you know,
0:43:34.960000 - 0:43:36.480000::I said fucking, it's not my fault.
0:43:36.480000 - 0:43:39.680000::I was totally not that that fucking hot blue raw.
0:43:39.680000 - 0:43:42.720000::So that's how you fight for the not to have the DUI.
0:43:42.720000 - 0:43:43.680000::It's the pretty good.
0:43:43.680000 - 0:43:44.960000::You killed the president.
0:43:44.960000 - 0:43:46.480000::He was like, okay, well, how much,
0:43:46.480000 - 0:43:47.520000::how many beers did you have?
0:43:47.520000 - 0:43:48.320000::Where were you?
0:43:48.320000 - 0:43:49.440000::Where were you in Wisconsin?
0:43:49.520000 - 0:43:51.360000::And then it's only in Wisconsin maybe.
0:43:51.360000 - 0:43:52.800000::And so he just sits on a chair all day.
0:43:52.800000 - 0:43:53.600000::People don't want to talk.
0:43:53.600000 - 0:43:54.960000::And this other Democratic Party keeps Wisconsin back.
0:43:54.960000 - 0:43:56.720000::Oh, because it's swing state.
0:43:56.720000 - 0:43:57.680000::Oh, yeah, swing state.
0:43:57.680000 - 0:43:59.520000::We need a creative consultant.
0:43:59.520000 - 0:44:00.880000::I love creative consultants.
0:44:00.880000 - 0:44:03.360000::Dude, I would love to, I would love to just spend
0:44:03.360000 - 0:44:05.760000::three, four months in the White House doing content.
0:44:06.800000 - 0:44:07.600000::Oh my god.
0:44:07.600000 - 0:44:08.800000::Don't say that to a lot, man.
0:44:08.800000 - 0:44:09.600000::It's scary.
0:44:09.600000 - 0:44:11.040000::Heading in closet, scaring people.
0:44:12 - 0:44:13.920000::Scaring by any past the way, immediately.
0:44:16.160000 - 0:44:17.840000::I'm stronger than that.
0:44:17.840000 - 0:44:18.880000::Didn't he break his foot?
0:44:18.880000 - 0:44:20.160000::Once, he'll remember that.
0:44:20.160000 - 0:44:21.840000::His skulls melting.
0:44:22.560000 - 0:44:24::Riding skulls melting?
0:44:24 - 0:44:25.920000::You think we said a lot of metal in his body?
0:44:25.920000 - 0:44:26.960000::Hell yeah.
0:44:26.960000 - 0:44:27.520000::I don't know.
0:44:27.520000 - 0:44:28.560000::Like hip replacement.
0:44:28.560000 - 0:44:29.520000::If you got a magnet,
0:44:29.520000 - 0:44:30.720000::it block away from his ass.
0:44:30.720000 - 0:44:32.480000::He's, that'd be a good way to steal somebody.
0:44:32.480000 - 0:44:33.520000::Oh my god.
0:44:33.520000 - 0:44:35.520000::Magnetize the president, take him in the block.
0:44:35.520000 - 0:44:36.400000::Oh my god.
0:44:36.400000 - 0:44:37.200000::Oh my god.
0:44:37.200000 - 0:44:38.160000::Cuba does, oh, man,
0:44:38.160000 - 0:44:39.920000::keep Magneto away from him.
0:44:39.920000 - 0:44:40.720000::I know.
0:44:40.720000 - 0:44:41.600000::I feel like Magneto.
0:44:41.600000 - 0:44:42.400000::Oh, Magneto.
0:44:42.400000 - 0:44:43.360000::He will Magneto.
0:44:44.320000 - 0:44:47.760000::If you had Magneto in a room with you for 10 minutes,
0:44:47.760000 - 0:44:48.400000::what would you do?
0:44:48.400000 - 0:44:49.280000::Where would you suck first?
0:44:49.280000 - 0:44:50.560000::Where would you suck first?
0:44:50.560000 - 0:44:51.280000::That's what we do.
0:44:53.120000 - 0:44:54.320000::You say, where would you need him?
0:44:54.320000 - 0:44:55.920000::The one from X-Men.
0:44:55.920000 - 0:44:58.800000::This is where the special education teachers should really like.
0:44:58.800000 - 0:44:59.920000::We should time stamp.

0:45:00 - 0:45:01::You know what?
0:45:01 - 0:45:02.800000::I had a dream last night.
0:45:02.800000 - 0:45:06::You need to factor Magneto into what class night.
0:45:06 - 0:45:07.200000::That's so close to my fucking name.
0:45:07.200000 - 0:45:09::You know Magneto's name is Eric.
0:45:09 - 0:45:10::Greyhill?
0:45:10 - 0:45:11::Oh yeah.
0:45:11 - 0:45:13::And he was also Holocaust.
0:45:13 - 0:45:14::I know.
0:45:14 - 0:45:16::Okay, glad to see you back.
0:45:16 - 0:45:17::Glad to see you back.
0:45:17 - 0:45:18::That would be good.
0:45:18 - 0:45:19::You should play Magneto in a play in one.
0:45:19 - 0:45:21::Oh my gosh.
0:45:21 - 0:45:22::1x1 man play.
0:45:22 - 0:45:23::That would be so...
0:45:23 - 0:45:24::Yeah.
0:45:24 - 0:45:27::How you could tie Magneto in Vietnam?
0:45:27 - 0:45:30::Everyone brings, yeah, some metal in there.
0:45:30 - 0:45:35::You could put a, yeah, like a teapot under every chair and tie them all with yo-yo strings.
0:45:35 - 0:45:36::Oh my gosh.
0:45:36 - 0:45:40::Yeah, but what you're staying in is with buckets full of spoons in there throwing at you nails.
0:45:40 - 0:45:41::And I'm not going like that.
0:45:41 - 0:45:46::Yeah, Magneto's so fucking sick to be able to affect metal as such.
0:45:46 - 0:45:49::Yes, yes.
0:45:49 - 0:45:51::To say the least and say it.
0:45:51 - 0:45:53::To speak and so to speak.
0:45:53 - 0:45:54::That's it.
0:45:54 - 0:45:59::Now listen, speaking of the special needs of it all, special ed we say.
0:45:59 - 0:46:00::Were you special needs, Nate?
0:46:00 - 0:46:03::No, but my mom is a special education teacher.
0:46:03 - 0:46:06::So in a way, my whole life was a special education class.
0:46:06 - 0:46:07::Yeah.
0:46:07 - 0:46:10::And you also video game addiction battled classic sign.
0:46:10 - 0:46:12::You have battled so many addictions, man.

0:46:14 - 0:46:15::You're a battle thing one right now, man.
0:46:15 - 0:46:16::It seems to be here.
0:46:16 - 0:46:18::No, definitely not.
0:46:18 - 0:46:21::I should have passed a while long time ago for sure.
0:46:21 - 0:46:24::You're supposed to be in Germantown, Ohio.
0:46:24 - 0:46:26::Oh my god, 300 pounds heavier.
0:46:26 - 0:46:27::Big ass.
0:46:27 - 0:46:32::Add to the Superman ride at six likes.
0:46:32 - 0:46:38::Joey tactics in Milwaukee.
0:46:38 - 0:46:40::Shout out damn black in Milwaukee.

1:06:26 - 1:06:27::Remedies in the 15.
1:06:27 - 1:06:28::Oh my God.
1:06:28 - 1:06:29::15 inch here.
1:06:29 - 1:06:30::15 feet.
1:06:30 - 1:06:31::Good.
1:06:31 - 1:06:32::Right.
1:06:32 - 1:06:33::Why that?
1:06:33 - 1:06:34::I got a wide flat one.
1:06:34 - 1:06:35::I've already shown my feet.
1:06:35 - 1:06:36::We do this every other day.
1:06:36 - 1:06:37::It's not a good one.
1:06:37 - 1:06:39::You're going to a wide foot shoe store.
1:06:39 - 1:06:40::Yeah.
1:06:40 - 1:06:41::Well, I need to do that.
1:06:41 - 1:06:44::I just, yeah, I just get wide wide shoes.
1:06:44 - 1:06:45::My sister called me.
1:06:45 - 1:06:47::There's one of these fucking clogs now because it's eight o'clock.
1:06:47 - 1:06:48::Okay.
1:06:48 - 1:06:49::Well, should we say what gave it to you?
1:06:49 - 1:06:50::Let's say we gave it to you.
1:06:50 - 1:06:51::And I have an idea.
1:06:51 - 1:06:54::I'm going to go to Endorphinport.com and buy the mask.
1:06:54 - 1:06:55::Oh, yeah.
1:06:55 - 1:06:56::Endorphin.
1:06:56 - 1:06:57::Right.
1:06:57 - 1:06:59::I have an idea for what gave us all joy.
1:06:59 - 1:07:01::I was going to say what gave us all joy.
1:07:01 - 1:07:02::Oh, no.
1:07:02 - 1:07:03::Oh, no.
1:07:03 - 1:07:05::What else am I going to say?
1:07:05 - 1:07:07::I had fucking sandwiches on it.
1:07:07 - 1:07:08::Yeah.
1:07:08 - 1:07:09::I'm trying to think of what gave me joy this week.
1:07:09 - 1:07:10::Well, you can do something fun.
1:07:10 - 1:07:11::What gave me joy?
1:07:11 - 1:07:13::Conor O'Malley and Dorphinport.com.
1:07:13 - 1:07:16::You know, the film, the mask.
1:07:16 - 1:07:19::It's the most confusing way to have paywall content ever.
1:07:19 - 1:07:20::Yeah.
1:07:20 - 1:07:21::I have it on the website.
1:07:21 - 1:07:22::It's cool.
1:07:22 - 1:07:23::It should be commended.
1:07:23 - 1:07:25::You should be commended as people with a statement.
1:07:25 - 1:07:28::Understandably so, people don't understand the concept.
1:07:28 - 1:07:34::But the money goes directly to the down the drain foundation.
1:07:34 - 1:07:36::Yeah, people don't know that.
1:07:36 - 1:07:39::You're funding like just proxy wars with this.
1:07:39 - 1:07:40::I'm just sending embole.
1:07:40 - 1:07:41::It's just right.
1:07:41 - 1:07:42::You crane on embole.
1:07:42 - 1:07:43::Yeah, right.
1:07:43 - 1:07:44::You just throw out the window.
1:07:44 - 1:07:45::Yeah.
1:07:45 - 1:07:47::The mask is incredible.
1:07:47 - 1:07:48::Starting air.
1:07:48 - 1:07:49::Starting air.
1:07:49 - 1:07:50::Starting Conor O'Malley.
1:07:50 - 1:07:51::Starting Conor O'Malley.
1:07:51 - 1:07:52::Starting SeaWorld.
1:07:52 - 1:07:53::No spoiler.
1:07:53 - 1:07:58::And maybe we can't talk about it, but maybe we got something else.
1:07:58 - 1:08:00::We might have somebody else kicking them.
1:08:00 - 1:08:03::I feel like we do this like on every fight.
1:08:03 - 1:08:04::There's something going on.
1:08:04 - 1:08:05::There's something happening.
1:08:05 - 1:08:06::There's something.
1:08:06 - 1:08:07::There's something.
1:08:07 - 1:08:11::There's something that's painfully slow that's happening.
1:08:11 - 1:08:13::Maybe you can see on the other side of that wall.
1:08:13 - 1:08:14::You can see marinating.
1:08:14 - 1:08:15::It's marinating.
1:08:15 - 1:08:16::It's marinating.
1:08:16 - 1:08:17::Well, it's in the bananas.
1:08:17 - 1:08:19::Always it's something that we're working on in the banana.
1:08:19 - 1:08:20::Stan as well.
1:08:20 - 1:08:21::That's how we just say.
1:08:21 - 1:08:27.400000::What gave me joy was the mask and your port seeing my friends make something fucking funny
1:08:27.400000 - 1:08:28.400000::as hell.
1:08:28.400000 - 1:08:29.400000::Eric.
1:08:29.400000 - 1:08:34::What gave me frankly joy?
1:08:34 - 1:08:39::Well, you know, I've just been getting sick so much.
1:08:39 - 1:08:42::You were like about to cry.
1:08:42 - 1:08:43::You looked right.
1:08:43 - 1:08:46::You were kind of right in the eye.
1:08:46 - 1:08:49.840000::This was sadly my joy about a month ago when I got sick and I was like, I'm so happy
1:08:49.840000 - 1:08:52.120000::to not be sick anymore.
1:08:52.120000 - 1:08:56.600000::And hopefully I'm just praying, God, please don't let me get sick again because I'm tired
1:08:56.600000 - 1:08:59.120000::of feeling that way.
1:08:59.120000 - 1:09:03.800000::It makes me scared too because we're in the car or whatever last week I think.
1:09:03.800000 - 1:09:07.880000::And you said, if I got sick once and then I got sick a second time and now I'm sick
1:09:07.880000 - 1:09:12.560000::a third time in one month, is that immunocompromised?
1:09:12.560000 - 1:09:13.560000::Something's wrong with you.
1:09:13.560000 - 1:09:18.400000::I think my amuses was just down for the count from a COVID early this month and then I
1:09:18.400000 - 1:09:19.400000::got a cold.
1:09:19.400000 - 1:09:20.400000::That's it.
1:09:20.400000 - 1:09:21.400000::I'm healthy as a goat.
1:09:21.400000 - 1:09:23.160000::You skipped the phase where you can catch something early.
1:09:23.160000 - 1:09:27.040000::Like it's out of phase where it's like, yeah, you should have gone to the doctor's.
1:09:27.040000 - 1:09:28.280000::Oh, whatever your disease is.
1:09:28.280000 - 1:09:29.280000::Whatever it is.
1:09:29.280000 - 1:09:31.080000::It's like fully in my task.
1:09:31.080000 - 1:09:32.080000::It's my task.
1:09:32.080000 - 1:09:33.080000::No, I'm fucking good.
1:09:33.080000 - 1:09:34.080000::It's scary word.
1:09:34.080000 - 1:09:38.480000::Well, brought me joy is getting back to health, a full health and I'm rocking with you guys.
1:09:38.480000 - 1:09:40.560000::I'm going to be here for a lot longer.

1:09:41.560000 - 1:09:44.560000::What gave me joy was of course the mask was incredible.
1:09:44.560000 - 1:09:45.560000::I loved it.
1:09:45.560000 - 1:09:48.560000::It was it was so fucking good.

1:09:53.160000 - 1:09:55.920000::If you've only got five bucks, hit me up on Instagram.
1:09:55.920000 - 1:09:58::I'll send you a fucking link, whatever.
1:09:58 - 1:10:00.040000::You got to prove to me that you guys send me.

1:10:04.280000 - 1:10:06.280000::I'm probably the most frugal person on planet Earth.
1:10:06.280000 - 1:10:07.280000::What's that mean?
1:10:07.280000 - 1:10:10.160000::Frugal means you don't like to spend money, cheat person.
1:10:10.160000 - 1:10:13.200000::And I was so fucking gung ho.
1:10:13.200000 - 1:10:14.520000::I bought it and it was like,
1:10:14.520000 - 1:10:15.360000::Hey man.

1:10:24.080000 - 1:10:24.920000::I'll pay five bucks.
1:10:24.920000 - 1:10:26.640000::Conrad remember when we went to the scooters
1:10:26.640000 - 1:10:27.480000::you were going around?
1:10:27.480000 - 1:10:28.320000::That was fun.
1:10:28.320000 - 1:10:29.480000::That was pretty fun.
1:10:29.480000 - 1:10:32.320000::You can see us on scooters in the video.
1:10:32.320000 - 1:10:33.320000::Yeah, that's cool.

1:10:45.920000 - 1:10:47.200000::I may not speak about.
1:10:47.200000 - 1:10:48.560000::Oh no, no, no, no.

1:11:51.720000 - 1:11:54::That bit, specific bit to somebody else for once.
1:11:54 - 1:11:56::That's how it's going to be.
1:11:56 - 1:11:58::How are we going to be in that situation?

1:12:08.680000 - 1:12:09.520000::Look at that.
1:12:09.520000 - 1:12:10.360000::Yeah, I did.
1:12:10.360000 - 1:12:12.480000::I was crying about my report card.
1:12:12.480000 - 1:12:13.320000::All right.
1:12:13.320000 - 1:12:13.840000::Really?
1:12:13.840000 - 1:12:14.680000::Was it bad grades?
1:12:14.680000 - 1:12:15.680000::Bad.
1:12:15.680000 - 1:12:16.680000::It was not important.
1:12:16.680000 - 1:12:17.880000::Yeah, well, I think we should probably get it.
1:12:17.880000 - 1:12:18.720000::I mean, how much?
1:12:18.720000 - 1:12:20.640000::Now we got to go.
1:12:20.640000 - 1:12:22.880000::That's the end.
1:12:22.880000 - 1:12:23.960000::Well, what gave me joy?
1:12:23.960000 - 1:12:24.960000::Oh, sorry.
1:12:24.960000 - 1:12:27.560000::What gave you joy, Connery?
1:12:27.560000 - 1:12:29.760000::I had, I had what did I have?
1:12:29.760000 - 1:12:31.280000::That sandwich today was good.
1:12:31.280000 - 1:12:32.280000::Talk about that.
1:12:32.280000 - 1:12:33.280000::Oh, that was tricky.
1:12:33.280000 - 1:12:34.280000::It was tricky.
1:12:34.280000 - 1:12:35.280000::From where?
1:12:35.280000 - 1:12:36.280000::New York.
1:12:36.280000 - 1:12:37.280000::You can't get anywhere else.
1:12:37.280000 - 1:12:38.280000::From just the regular daily.
1:12:38.280000 - 1:12:39.280000::I'm just wondering what the fuck is that?
1:12:39.280000 - 1:12:40.280000::It's so true.
1:12:40.280000 - 1:12:41.280000::Can't they export that shit?
1:12:41.280000 - 1:12:42.600000::I had a MacGridel for the first time.
1:12:42.600000 - 1:12:44.640000::And I thought, if you are living in New York City
