0:01:49.160000 - 0:01:53.520000::And it was like, I was, I was like losing my mind in a prison cell.
0:01:53.520000 - 0:01:55.160000::So I was like, okay.
0:01:58.120000 - 0:01:59.880000::And you're filming it yourself for Jay.

0:02:20.240000 - 0:02:21.760000::I couldn't feel worse there.
0:02:21.760000 - 0:02:22.720000::There's nothing to be embarrassed.
0:02:22.720000 - 0:02:25.880000::What's embarrassing is if you're some pathetic idiot
0:02:25.880000 - 0:02:29.240000::who's afraid to go for their dreams in the way that you're not.
0:02:29.240000 - 0:02:30.400000::And afraid to express that.
0:02:30.400000 - 0:02:31.240000::That's true.
0:02:31.240000 - 0:02:32.360000::I need, I need a reminder about that.

0:02:38.320000 - 0:02:43.800000::Even if that means, from, even if that means humiliating yourself
0:02:43.800000 - 0:02:47.320000::in front of everybody and having to go bad, you know?
0:02:47.320000 - 0:02:48.320000::Right.

0:03:02.680000 - 0:03:03.560000::I just fucking hit my head on the wall.
0:03:03.560000 - 0:03:04.560000::Did you?
0:03:04.560000 - 0:03:06.560000::All right.
0:03:06.560000 - 0:03:09.720000::You look, you just look pissed at the wall, shocking,
0:03:09.720000 - 0:03:10.920000::but trade by the wall.
0:03:10.920000 - 0:03:11.920000::Don't look to that.
0:03:11.920000 - 0:03:12.920000::I mean, that wall of that wall.
0:03:12.920000 - 0:03:15.520000::Well, fuck with you.
0:03:15.520000 - 0:03:18.920000::Worst audition I've ever had, I told the story recently
0:03:18.920000 - 0:03:23.160000::at our Jack and I show IDGA, F all the G.
0:03:23.160000 - 0:03:26.160000::But the one's the next one and one's the next one promoted right now.
0:03:26.160000 - 0:03:27.920000::It's every, they're provost of.
0:03:27.920000 - 0:03:28.920000::It's every third way.
0:03:28.920000 - 0:03:29.920000::Every day.
0:03:29.920000 - 0:03:33.440000::You know, buy your tickets now because they will sell out.
0:03:33.440000 - 0:03:36.920000::They will sell out about probably 10 minutes before the show.
0:03:36.920000 - 0:03:40.280000::Don't even try to get tickets, honestly, because you probably won't be able to.
0:03:40.280000 - 0:03:41.280000::Sorry.
0:03:41.280000 - 0:03:42.760000::I couldn't come.
0:03:42.760000 - 0:03:48.400000::But no, the worst, the worst audition I ever did was for
0:03:49.480000 - 0:03:51.840000::and we all know people of all of this.
0:03:51.840000 - 0:03:56.120000::There's no shade at the production that happened, whatever, no hard feelings.
0:03:56.120000 - 0:03:59.680000::But it was for a magic mic parody musical.
0:03:59.680000 - 0:04:01.280000::Remember this Nate?
0:04:01.280000 - 0:04:04.880000::Was it a live show?
0:04:04.880000 - 0:04:05.880000::Yes.
0:04:05.880000 - 0:04:06.880000::Oh my god.
0:04:06.880000 - 0:04:07.880000::It was in Chicago.
0:04:07.880000 - 0:04:12.120000::I had like just graduated college and I was like just getting into that scene.
0:04:12.120000 - 0:04:15.080000::And I didn't really know anybody yet.
0:04:15.080000 - 0:04:19.640000::And I was like, I'm going to fucking try my heart because I wanted to be a part of the
0:04:19.640000 - 0:04:22.760000::just any like, quote, unquote, cool show.
0:04:22.760000 - 0:04:23.760000::Right.
0:04:23.760000 - 0:04:24.960000::Until I thought this was kind of it.
0:04:24.960000 - 0:04:31.640000::And so the audition was to go into the CIC theater in Chicago into that black box sort
0:04:31.640000 - 0:04:34.800000::of theater and bring them bring some music.
0:04:34.800000 - 0:04:37.960000::They had a little speaker that they hooked up like a little bike speaker that they played
0:04:37.960000 - 0:04:38.960000::for you.
0:04:38.960000 - 0:04:45.040000::And I found this like sound cloud like, I don't know, like pop song.
0:04:45.040000 - 0:04:48.200000::And it was for two people, two people that were directing it.
0:04:48.200000 - 0:04:51.240000::And you just had to strip, you had to kind of strip down for them.
0:04:51.240000 - 0:04:53.160000::I think I kept my pants on.
0:04:53.160000 - 0:04:57.720000::But took off my shirt and I was already so so conscious about like my body.
0:04:57.720000 - 0:05:00::It was just like, look.

0:05:00 - 0:05:02::and
0:05:02 - 0:05:04::I'm not really sure if you're
0:05:04 - 0:05:06::going to be able to
0:05:06 - 0:05:10::literally like kind of dancing to this little shitty bike speaker
0:05:10 - 0:05:14::in silence and like trying to be like sexy but kind of joking and but also just like
0:05:14 - 0:05:16::feeling so intensely red and sweaty and hot
0:05:16 - 0:05:18::immediately it felt very it went
0:05:18 - 0:05:20::and yeah I went badly and I never
0:05:20 - 0:05:22::never heard from them about that
0:05:22 - 0:05:24::they said thank you
0:05:24 - 0:05:26::you didn't get to know or anything like that
0:05:26 - 0:05:28::didn't get to know
0:05:28 - 0:05:32::that's what that's what people don't realize is you don't even you don't
0:05:32 - 0:05:36::hear anything you know you know hear a damn thing nobody says no to you
0:05:36 - 0:05:40::it's just like you just it's just radio silence with this
0:05:40 - 0:05:42::they're conflict avoidant
0:05:42 - 0:05:46::that's right it's pathetic yeah
0:05:46 - 0:05:48::can can you imagine if they're
0:05:48 - 0:05:50::having during a marriage proposal
0:05:50 - 0:05:54::and somebody said will I met can you marry me and they said
0:05:54 - 0:05:57.840000::nothing in response that would make really a question that
0:05:57.840000 - 0:06:01.840000::would blow up on that blow up on take talk on do more
0:06:01.840000 - 0:06:05.840000::I want to start a casting company that
0:06:05.840000 - 0:06:09.840000::that not only calls you but tells you why you suck just to
0:06:09.840000 - 0:06:13.840000::just kind of differentiate it's like they didn't like it's one of the
0:06:13.840000 - 0:06:17.840000::yeah I addressed it but poor body fat percentage you know we're looking

0:06:33.840000 - 0:06:39.840000::I just want to say it was a mac and cheese commercial
0:06:39.840000 - 0:06:43.840000::for a large company I won't name them but let's just say it rhymes with raft
0:06:43.840000 - 0:06:47.840000::and I was in Chicago as well this is back in the day
0:06:47.840000 - 0:06:51.840000::and I actually went into the audition and they

0:07:07.840000 - 0:07:09.840000::convert-trunch controversial issue
0:07:09.840000 - 0:07:13.840000::and I said like something crazy like
0:07:13.840000 - 0:07:17.840000::I like to take a big bunch of big bite out of it

0:09:37.840000 - 0:09:39.840000::they're framing it as humiliation
0:09:39.840000 - 0:09:41.840000::and they're little whatever
0:09:41.840000 - 0:09:43.840000::they're doing

0:10:04.140000 - 0:10:07.140000::So you're saying humiliation is actually premise swag.
0:10:07.580000 - 0:10:10.080000::Well humiliation means that you're doing something different.
0:10:10.200000 - 0:10:13.160000::It means that and doing something different, by the way, is how they invented
0:10:13.160000 - 0:10:17.160000::the light bulb because light bulbs were very different from the darkness
0:10:17.160000 - 0:10:18.920000::that humanity was living in back then.
0:10:19.260000 - 0:10:24.200000::The light bulbs were so you would want to start a nation of humiliation.
0:10:25.120000 - 0:10:27.240000::Say it again, humiliation.
0:10:27.240000 - 0:10:31.080000::That humiliation, that humiliation, kind of like a group of people.

0:10:41.680000 - 0:10:43.200000::Why is that so hard to understand?
0:10:43.200000 - 0:10:45.720000::We just don't do a lot of wordplay on this podcast.
0:10:45.720000 - 0:10:46.840000::I know. I'm so new.
0:10:46.840000 - 0:10:48.240000::We're like, I love it.
0:10:48.240000 - 0:10:54.560000::I think this is a, this is a, this is a pun free zone.
0:10:54.600000 - 0:10:56.200000::I see I couldn't think of a pun for that.
0:10:56.200000 - 0:10:58.640000::I discovered wordplay though.
0:10:58.640000 - 0:11:02.040000::And you've been having a lot of fun with kind of structuring words in different ways.
0:11:02.040000 - 0:11:06.640000::And it's been, it's been honestly kind of fun to see you work in that way.
0:11:06.760000 - 0:11:10.240000::Which you kind of mostly try to not with like strangers that I respect.
0:11:10.240000 - 0:11:14.040000::I don't know them that well, but I feel like that's my in is trying to work
0:11:14.040000 - 0:11:14.560000::play on them.

0:11:24.840000 - 0:11:26.200000::My stomach hurts.
0:11:26.200000 - 0:11:30.760000::I have to, my stomach hurts so bad that I think I'm going to have to step away
0:11:30.760000 - 0:11:32.760000::from the podcast for about five minutes.
0:11:32.760000 - 0:11:35.040000::I don't think I'm going to throw up, but it's on the table.
0:11:36.120000 - 0:11:36.960000::You need to do it.
0:11:36.960000 - 0:11:38.360000::Do it step away.
0:11:38.360000 - 0:11:38.960000::Step away.
0:11:38.960000 - 0:11:39.680000::Step away.
0:11:39.680000 - 0:11:40.480000::And that's fine.
0:11:40.480000 - 0:11:42.480000::That's how, that's how gracious we are as hosting.
0:11:42.480000 - 0:11:45.080000::Just like, that's why we have three of us, you know what I'm saying?
0:11:45.080000 - 0:11:49.760000::When, when the other person's not talking, we like walk away for a little bit.
0:11:49.760000 - 0:11:51.720000::So it's like we kind of have like planned little breaks.
0:11:51.720000 - 0:11:56.040000::When you think that like Jack's not talking, he's just like going to the kitchen or something.
0:11:56.040000 - 0:12:00.080000::We're taking care of business, money, we're doing multi-taxing.
0:12:00.080000 - 0:12:04.280000::And guess what Nate, nobody's ever heard us do a one-on-one,
0:12:04.280000 - 0:12:05.760000::which is what a lot of people have asked.
0:12:05.760000 - 0:12:10.360000::Well, people are begging and I'm like, shut the fuck up.
0:12:10.360000 - 0:12:12.240000::Like Jack isn't that bad.
0:12:12.240000 - 0:12:13.600000::Like, like, it's not.

0:12:31.760000 - 0:12:32.760000::It's been pretty good.
0:12:32.760000 - 0:12:34.960000::And I think it's because I've been staying busy, dude.
0:12:34.960000 - 0:12:35.960000::That, yes.
0:12:35.960000 - 0:12:38.800000::Because you can't, you don't even have time to confront the demons.
0:12:38.800000 - 0:12:40.320000::You know, the demons can't even...
0:12:40.320000 - 0:12:41.320000::Exactly.
0:12:41.320000 - 0:12:45.360000::Idol, Idol hands are the devil's play things or something like this.

0:12:50.400000 - 0:12:55.360000::And a lot of young men in this country, they got fucking nothing to do.
0:12:55.360000 - 0:12:57.520000::So they turned to hate, dude.
0:12:57.520000 - 0:13:01.560000::And if they had short film screenings to go to and if they had,
0:13:01.560000 - 0:13:04.600000::I'll turn to comedy shows to be going and hosting and if they had...
0:13:04.600000 - 0:13:06.240000::The world would be such a better place.
0:13:06.240000 - 0:13:11::In every body who was doing full comedy and going to short film screenings.
0:13:11 - 0:13:13::And I've been drinking too.

0:13:29.280000 - 0:13:30.280000::Whenever you are in...
0:13:30.280000 - 0:13:33.800000::So anybody who's not in the 30s right now, listen to me.

0:13:53.760000 - 0:13:54.840000::That's also the devil's work.
0:13:54.840000 - 0:13:56.160000::It sucks to throw up.

0:16:48.360000 - 0:16:55.800000::All right, and most because we love you guys and guess what most listeners know this I would say 99% of our listeners are angels
0:16:55.800000 - 0:17:02.560000::But there's 1% haters out there that come for us and want us to fucking die painful deaths
0:17:02.560000 - 0:17:06::I keep getting these messages that want me to die in these ways. I've never even heard of
0:17:07 - 0:17:09::Creative messages
0:17:09 - 0:17:12.960000::I didn't even know you could die like that like that's pretty right
0:17:13.680000 - 0:17:20::Like I'm honestly like impressed by your creativity with that one. Yeah, man. Yeah, but speaking of throwing up Jack
0:17:20 - 0:17:25.120000::We were just telling the younger listeners that basically alcohols coming for them in their later days
0:17:25.880000 - 0:17:33.360000::To wreck how they feel the next day. Don't hang over style. Don't touch it. Don't touch it. Listen to our warning
0:17:33.720000 - 0:17:41.160000::Don't ever touch it. Don't ever feel it because guess what it feels so good and it's more cancerous than cigarettes look it up
0:17:41.880000 - 0:17:44.960000::Is that true? That can't be look it up
0:17:46.360000 - 0:17:50.160000::Unless I'm less cigarettes. I don't want to look that up. I
0:17:50.880000 - 0:17:56.360000::Want to I want to send a message to all the Andrew humans all the people that are out there saying
0:17:56.360000 - 0:18:01.440000::Yeah, you can have two drinks a week and you got to optimize this and this shut the fuck up right now
0:18:03.360000 - 0:18:10.600000::Shut up right now. I don't need you in my ears because I respect these men so much and that's my problem is if I didn't give a fuck about them
0:18:10.600000 - 0:18:11.600000::I could just tune it out
0:18:11.600000 - 0:18:17.480000::But I respect them and their bodies and their health and their messages so much that if they tell me something unfortunately
0:18:17.480000 - 0:18:20.420000::I'm gonna listen, but I don't have the willpower to do what they're saying
0:18:20.420000 - 0:18:25.360000::So I have to know the knowledge and then still be failing. You know, I'm saying which is a horrible
0:18:26 - 0:18:28::Devil's curse that's upon me
0:18:28 - 0:18:32.280000::You know that Andrew Huberman could snap you like a fucking twig air
0:18:32.640000 - 0:18:35.800000::Yeah, I know he good for him good for him
0:18:36.440000 - 0:18:41.680000::For now. Oh, yeah, and that is his bench 185. Oh, please
0:18:42.920000 - 0:18:48.160000::That'd be really you that's really cool man, and that'd be really useful back in the day when everything sucked
0:18:48.600000 - 0:18:54.520000::Bad but now that it doesn't matter if you're strong in fact the big strong people are
0:18:55.400000 - 0:18:57.400000::Doing what now kind of dancing
0:18:57.400000 - 0:19:02.760000::Lifting the rocks being pretty for us. No, no, they wish they were breaking rocks. They're just
0:19:03.200000 - 0:19:06.040000::They're just asked that they're just they're just as the titions
0:19:06.400000 - 0:19:11.800000::They're you know, they're not even cool anymore. It's all about the weak nerds who are really the
0:19:12.320000 - 0:19:19.320000::Savages of this culture the sandbankman frees right I was just reading an article and we're not gonna talk about AI
0:19:19.320000 - 0:19:23.840000::So nobody turned it off because we just brought up AI, but talking about how coders
0:19:23.840000 - 0:19:28.840000::Programmas software engineers are going the way of
0:19:29.680000 - 0:19:31.680000::Do dodo
0:19:31.840000 - 0:19:33.840000::No
0:19:35.400000 - 0:19:36.920000::Dodo
0:19:36.920000 - 0:19:41.680000::Because because AI is gonna be able to basically just do it off of text
0:19:41.680000 - 0:19:49.520000::Come on ever is this so whatever dude. I'm just tired of being alive and not in a scary way, but it's just well
0:19:49.520000 - 0:19:51.920000::We have so many updates all the time
0:19:51.920000 - 0:19:59.480000::We should know stability no stasis human beings adapt. That's what we do

0:20:00 - 0:20:01.920000::So, AI can go and do this in that,
0:20:01.920000 - 0:20:03.880000::but the funny thing about trying to kill something
0:20:03.880000 - 0:20:06.220000::that's shapeless is that it's shapeless.
0:20:06.220000 - 0:20:08.600000::And so, even if you jump poison in a cup,
0:20:08.600000 - 0:20:09.880000::it's still gonna live, you know,
0:20:09.880000 - 0:20:10.960000::it's treated like a liquid.
0:20:10.960000 - 0:20:12.960000::So, learn that.
0:20:12.960000 - 0:20:16.280000::And another thing about the body stuff
0:20:16.280000 - 0:20:18.040000::in the Andrew Huberman giving advice,
0:20:18.040000 - 0:20:22.040000::like people who dull out advice so eagerly are fools.
0:20:22.040000 - 0:20:24.160000::They are damn fools and they are grifters,
0:20:24.160000 - 0:20:25.480000::they're just trying to get your money.
0:20:25.480000 - 0:20:28.520000::Because human beings, let me put this in terms of cars.
0:20:28.840000 - 0:20:31.800000::Every human, if you consider that every human being
0:20:31.800000 - 0:20:33.600000::needs something different in order to keep
0:20:33.600000 - 0:20:36.480000::the oil changed correctly,
0:20:36.480000 - 0:20:38.360000::there's basically eight billion people alive.
0:20:38.360000 - 0:20:41.280000::That's eight billion different vehicles.
0:20:41.280000 - 0:20:43.360000::And to prescribe one thing.
0:20:43.360000 - 0:20:44.200000::Dude.
0:20:44.200000 - 0:20:45.680000::They're fools.
0:20:45.680000 - 0:20:46.520000::There's simply fools.
0:20:46.520000 - 0:20:48.480000::We're complex creatures.
0:20:48.480000 - 0:20:49.320000::They're simply fools.
0:20:49.320000 - 0:20:50.640000::And Jack, you were just talk.
0:20:50.640000 - 0:20:52.520000::Sometimes you speak so,
0:20:54.240000 - 0:20:56.520000::I'm not even joking right now.
0:20:56.520000 - 0:20:58.560000::You don't have necessarily a,
0:20:58.560000 - 0:21:01.520000::in my opinion, a linear way of speaking sometimes,
0:21:01.520000 - 0:21:04.600000::you're coming at it like an AI with like a quantum computer.
0:21:04.600000 - 0:21:05.600000::Where you're going,
0:21:05.600000 - 0:21:06.600000::shink, shoot in the shot right there.
0:21:06.600000 - 0:21:07.600000::Shink, shink, shink, shink.
0:21:07.600000 - 0:21:09.040000::It's like coming all over.
0:21:09.040000 - 0:21:10.920000::And then I'm like, where's it going with this?
0:21:10.920000 - 0:21:13.120000::Comes together in a way where it blows my mind.
0:21:13.120000 - 0:21:16.640000::Comes together like sex on your wedding night.
0:21:17.560000 - 0:21:18.400000::Yeah, exactly.
0:21:18.400000 - 0:21:19.240000::Exactly, dude.
0:21:19.240000 - 0:21:20.840000::I don't even know where you're going with that.
0:21:20.840000 - 0:21:23.360000::But I talked to a mutual friend last night,
0:21:23.360000 - 0:21:24.600000::whose name I won't mention,
0:21:24.600000 - 0:21:25.800000::because there's Liberty.
0:21:25.800000 - 0:21:27.440000::And they were like,
0:21:27.440000 - 0:21:28.600000::I was listening to the podcast
0:21:28.600000 - 0:21:31.640000::and Jack has such a poetic way of speaking.
0:21:31.640000 - 0:21:32.640000::Well, I'm a lyricist.
0:21:32.640000 - 0:21:33.840000::I know I'm not a musician,
0:21:33.840000 - 0:21:34.880000::but I'm a lyricist.
0:21:34.880000 - 0:21:35.720000::Know that.
0:21:35.720000 - 0:21:37.040000::And when my album comes out.
0:21:37.040000 - 0:21:38.400000::You are a musician, dude.
0:21:38.400000 - 0:21:40::The Ave Maria.
0:21:40 - 0:21:41::I'm not a musician.
0:21:41 - 0:21:42.600000::You were going off about music.
0:21:42.600000 - 0:21:43.880000::People hobbiased.
0:21:43.880000 - 0:21:45.040000::I'm a musical hobbyist,
0:21:45.040000 - 0:21:46.960000::but I'm a lyricist at the end of the day.
0:21:46.960000 - 0:21:47.880000::I'm not a comedian.
0:21:47.880000 - 0:21:49.240000::I'm not a filmmaker.
0:21:49.240000 - 0:21:50.400000::I'm not a whatever.
0:21:50.400000 - 0:21:52.880000::They call me in the articles.
0:21:52.880000 - 0:21:54.760000::I am a lyricist,
0:21:54.760000 - 0:21:56.480000::because lyrics are communication.
0:21:56.480000 - 0:21:57.440000::And I just googled it
0:21:57.440000 - 0:21:58.680000::and drinking a bottle of wine
0:21:58.680000 - 0:22:00.720000::carries the same lifetime cancer risk
0:22:00.720000 - 0:22:02.560000::as smoking 10 cigarettes a week.
0:22:03.760000 - 0:22:05.080000::What the?
0:22:05.080000 - 0:22:07.200000::Oh, no, man.
0:22:07.200000 - 0:22:08.560000::Are you fucking serious?
0:22:08.560000 - 0:22:11::A bottle of wine is the same as 10 siggies.
0:22:12 - 0:22:12.840000::A weed?
0:22:12.840000 - 0:22:13.840000::No fucking shit.
0:22:13.840000 - 0:22:15.600000::But this ties off too bad.
0:22:15.600000 - 0:22:17.080000::I'll just tell you that.
0:22:17.080000 - 0:22:18.520000::That's like a cigarette a day, you know?
0:22:18.520000 - 0:22:21.120000::What are you going to say to those old,
0:22:21.120000 - 0:22:23.600000::old 98 year old
0:22:23.600000 - 0:22:25.560000::that are sitting on in Greece,
0:22:25.560000 - 0:22:28.440000::smoking their sigs, drinking their wine,
0:22:28.440000 - 0:22:31::drinking straight up all of oil all day.
0:22:31 - 0:22:34.800000::You want to tell them that they're only consuming cancer?
0:22:34.800000 - 0:22:36.280000::You can't,
0:22:36.280000 - 0:22:37.640000::because they won't understand you in English.
0:22:37.640000 - 0:22:38.720000::They speak Greek.
0:22:38.720000 - 0:22:39.560000::Right.
0:22:39.560000 - 0:22:42.040000::You think they're eating cancer?
0:22:42.040000 - 0:22:44.240000::No, you got to go up on Greek people right now.
0:22:44.240000 - 0:22:45.800000::You got to get off on that one.
0:22:45.800000 - 0:22:46.640000::We got to keep an eye on you.
0:22:46.640000 - 0:22:48::Don't get me fucking started.
0:22:48 - 0:22:50.560000::You know, I hate those fucking acid.
0:22:50.560000 - 0:22:53.560000::If there was any Greek people listening right now,
0:22:53.840000 - 0:22:55.400000::pause shut up.
0:22:55.400000 - 0:22:57.880000::We don't want your ass bitches.
0:22:57.880000 - 0:22:58.600000::Except for stop.
0:22:58.600000 - 0:22:59.520000::Except for stop.
0:22:59.520000 - 0:23:00.200000::Stop.
0:23:00.200000 - 0:23:01.560000::No, no, no, no, stop.
0:23:01.560000 - 0:23:02.880000::I'll put your ass on glass.
0:23:02.880000 - 0:23:03.920000::Fuck you, bitch.
0:23:03.920000 - 0:23:05.480000::No Greeks.
0:23:05.480000 - 0:23:06.600000::Bye Greeks.
0:23:06.600000 - 0:23:07.960000::Your time's up.
0:23:07.960000 - 0:23:09.360000::You had your time.
0:23:10.880000 - 0:23:12.760000::Y'all, you know what I just learned?
0:23:12.760000 - 0:23:14.080000::You know, I just learned this morning
0:23:14.080000 - 0:23:16.920000::that I couldn't believe I learned is that,
0:23:16.920000 - 0:23:18.040000::sorry, motorcycle.
0:23:18.040000 - 0:23:21.280000::I live in a really lively, young area.
0:23:21.360000 - 0:23:25.960000::I learned this morning that Rome, the Romans,
0:23:25.960000 - 0:23:29.240000::the Roman Empire, I hadn't really put it together
0:23:29.240000 - 0:23:30.320000::that they were Italian.
0:23:30.320000 - 0:23:32.040000::Is that correct?
0:23:32.040000 - 0:23:32.960000::Yeah.
0:23:32.960000 - 0:23:35.600000::Because the Roman is in the city of Rome.
0:23:35.600000 - 0:23:38.560000::I just, I had never put that together somehow
0:23:38.560000 - 0:23:40.160000::when I heard of like ancient Romans.
0:23:40.160000 - 0:23:43.240000::I didn't realize that was like Italy's Rome.
0:23:43.240000 - 0:23:46.600000::Can I blow your mind for a second, Jack, for one minute?
0:23:46.600000 - 0:23:47.440000::I wish.
0:23:47.440000 - 0:23:48.280000::I wish you would.
0:23:48.280000 - 0:23:51.720000::Rome, the city of Rome that is in Italy,
0:23:51.720000 - 0:23:55.280000::the empire of Rome extended further
0:23:55.280000 - 0:23:58.240000::than any other empire except for the British
0:23:58.240000 - 0:23:59.760000::has ever expanded.
0:23:59.760000 - 0:24:02.600000::So there were Romans in Britain.
0:24:02.600000 - 0:24:04.880000::There were Romans in Germany.
0:24:04.880000 - 0:24:08::There were Romans in Africa.
0:24:08 - 0:24:10.960000::There were Romans all over the damn place.
0:24:10.960000 - 0:24:12.840000::So what about the human empire?
0:24:12.840000 - 0:24:13.960000::Is that count?
0:24:14.920000 - 0:24:15.760000::No.
0:24:15.760000 - 0:24:16.760000::That's totally different.
0:24:16.760000 - 0:24:17.600000::It's different.
0:24:18.440000 - 0:24:19.440000::All right.
0:24:19.440000 - 0:24:23.840000::We have been studying third grade to sixth grade history
0:24:23.840000 - 0:24:26.440000::for the past couple of weeks.
0:24:26.440000 - 0:24:28::I don't know.
0:24:28 - 0:24:32.400000::It's been really fun to dig into what's happened.
0:24:32.400000 - 0:24:34.400000::Literally every fucking thing.
0:24:34.400000 - 0:24:35.120000::And you know what?
0:24:35.120000 - 0:24:36.520000::Whenever this shit gets brought up,
0:24:36.520000 - 0:24:38.720000::I genuinely have the desire to like share
0:24:38.720000 - 0:24:40.040000::some crazy knowledge with people.
0:24:40.040000 - 0:24:42.840000::Like when I brought this up, I wasn't just joking about.
0:24:42.840000 - 0:24:44.280000::I really wanted to let you know that the
0:24:44.280000 - 0:24:46.120000::the Roman Empire was crazy.
0:24:46.120000 - 0:24:48.760000::We are so fucking dumb.
0:24:48.760000 - 0:24:50.360000::Oh, don't say that, man.
0:24:50.360000 - 0:24:52.120000::No, no, no, just with facts.
0:24:52.120000 - 0:24:54.400000::But spiritually we're very smart.
0:24:54.400000 - 0:24:55.600000::Street smarts, though.
0:24:55.600000 - 0:24:58.520000::Oh, we got, we're the ironstein.
0:24:58.520000 - 0:24:59.520000::I'm the ironstine.
0:24:59.520000 - 0:25:00.520000::I'm the ironstine.

0:25:00 - 0:25:08.080000::Yeah, man. Are people worried that I threw up?
0:25:08.080000 - 0:25:13.920000::Well, I don't know. They should be. They should be because they care about you.
0:25:13.920000 - 0:25:17.040000::Oh, yeah. If you're listening, you're not worried about Jackson. Tell me right now.
0:25:17.040000 - 0:25:20.800000::I think it hurts because it could be much worse than just a virus.
0:25:20.800000 - 0:25:25.840000::And I don't even know if we should put that into the even into the air like that.
0:25:25.840000 - 0:25:28.720000::I'm superstitious like crazy. Oh, I know, Jack. I'm sorry.
0:25:28.720000 - 0:25:32.720000::Well, they're all going to be sending you kinetic vibrational energy to heal you.
0:25:32.720000 - 0:25:35.760000::And it's going to be retro. Can we send it to Jack right now?
0:25:35.760000 - 0:25:40.080000::So just think about Jack in a healing sense and then Jack.
0:25:40.080000 - 0:25:41.680000::Are they doing this from the future?
0:25:42.240000 - 0:25:45.280000::They're doing this from the future, but you can time and space are not.
0:25:45.280000 - 0:25:48.960000::This is cool. I'm in there. So they're you're going to feel it right now.
0:25:48.960000 - 0:25:50.560000::Even though this is recorded in the past.
0:25:50.560000 - 0:25:51.760000::All right, talk to me. Why are you going to be?
0:25:52.640000 - 0:25:54.880000::They're going to be sending this energy back into the past.
0:25:54.880000 - 0:25:57.760000::Yesterday, send that healing energy right now.
0:25:57.760000 - 0:25:58.640000::I just throw up my mouth.
0:25:58.640000 - 0:26:00.640000::So you can say go ahead.
0:26:00.640000 - 0:26:02.880000::Do you guys remember those YouTube videos that you can look up?
0:26:02.880000 - 0:26:10.720000::That's like, it's like at 220 whatever gigahertz frequency that makes you feel high
0:26:10.720000 - 0:26:12.720000::and different frequencies and different things of the body.
0:26:14 - 0:26:17.680000::I can do that with my own voice. I can go to those frequencies.
0:26:17.680000 - 0:26:19.040000::Go to 75 hertz now.
0:26:20.080000 - 0:26:20.720000::All right, all right.
0:26:21.520000 - 0:26:22.960000::I feel like Jack is getting there.
0:26:28.720000 - 0:26:30.720000::I'm not kidding. I'm not kidding.
0:26:31.280000 - 0:26:32.960000::My stomach felt better while you're doing that.
0:26:32.960000 - 0:26:34.880000::And the second you stopped it started hurting again.
0:26:45.600000 - 0:26:46.560000::Feel better, brother.
0:26:47.520000 - 0:26:48.960000::Music is healing.
0:26:49.600000 - 0:26:51.440000::Music really is fucking healing.
0:26:52.080000 - 0:26:59.200000::Oh, music is the only thing in the world that you can consume and consume and there's no downside.
0:27:00.640000 - 0:27:00.960000::Yeah.
0:27:00.960000 - 0:27:02.560000::You know what song I was listening to recently?
0:27:03.440000 - 0:27:07.840000::This is like so lame, but you're not song banned on the run.
0:27:08.560000 - 0:27:10.240000::Band on the run?
0:27:11.440000 - 0:27:15.680000::I mean, is there a better song on the planet than banned on the run?
0:27:15.840000 - 0:27:16.960000::I think I've ever heard it.
0:27:17.840000 - 0:27:20.320000::Because they change it up like crazy.
0:27:20.320000 - 0:27:22.400000::Because there's 17 songs on the song.
0:27:22.640000 - 0:27:26.480000::It was the first time they figured out that you could put multiple of these bitches into one
0:27:26.480000 - 0:27:27.200000::fucking song.
0:27:27.760000 - 0:27:28.880000::I've never heard that song.
0:27:28.880000 - 0:27:33.280000::I feel like I have only heard like 16 seconds of it during like a love sequence
0:27:33.280000 - 0:27:34.560000::in dumb and dumb or something.
0:27:34.560000 - 0:27:39.120000::It's like listening to a whole discography of an artist in two minutes.
0:27:40.240000 - 0:27:41.200000::Holy shit.
0:27:41.200000 - 0:27:45.280000::How many people do you guys think Paul McCartney has done?

0:27:49.600000 - 0:27:52.080000::Even more seconds of the third base.
0:27:52.080000 - 0:27:53.200000::A little better lot.
0:27:53.200000 - 0:27:54.640000::Video of him hitting the blunt.
0:27:55.920000 - 0:27:56.960000::No.

0:28:06 - 0:28:09.760000::He's like, oh, he probably, oh, well, they were tripping.
0:28:09.760000 - 0:28:11.920000::You realize they were the first.
0:28:11.920000 - 0:28:15.280000::They were the first group to get all trippy with it.
0:28:15.280000 - 0:28:15.680000::Yeah.
0:28:17.360000 - 0:28:22.480000::And you know, he had a crazy member of the music video for The Girl's Mine.

0:29:12.800000 - 0:29:15.520000::And they're listening to our Kelly's ignition.
0:29:16.320000 - 0:29:20::And my year Michael doing a little voiceover, I think it was part of like a documentary.
0:29:20 - 0:29:24.240000::He's kind of like, I just like to get us silly and get out crazy with my friends in the
0:29:24.240000 - 0:29:24.960000::car sometimes.

0:29:32.560000 - 0:29:35.600000::And he's like, don't all crazy with his shoulders.

0:30:00 - 0:30:05::Cartney told Michael Jackson about owning the publishing.
0:30:05.460000 - 0:30:07.800000::And he was like, that's where you really make the money
0:30:07.800000 - 0:30:11::of owning your own publishing.
0:30:11 - 0:30:15.040000::And Paul McCartney was doing this interview.
0:30:15.040000 - 0:30:17.640000::And he was like, he was like so pissed off
0:30:17.640000 - 0:30:19.320000::because Michael Jackson was like,
0:30:19.320000 - 0:30:20.800000::hey, that's so funny.
0:30:20.800000 - 0:30:23.600000::Like, you know, that really only,
0:30:23.600000 - 0:30:24.640000::and he thought he was joking around.
0:30:24.640000 - 0:30:27.280000::He was like, hey, I'm gonna buy your fucking publishing man.
0:30:27.280000 - 0:30:28.280000::He was like, hot.
0:30:28.280000 - 0:30:30.720000::All right, all right, Michael, you know, like,

0:30:32.560000 - 0:30:35::He bought all the Beatles publishing.
0:30:35 - 0:30:37.720000::And he said he's written him like,
0:30:37.720000 - 0:30:39.280000::letters trying to say like,
0:30:39.280000 - 0:30:40.960000::hey man, that wasn't cool, what you did.

0:30:42.480000 - 0:30:45.720000::And I think he was a menace.
0:30:45.720000 - 0:30:46.720000::Not even a cool guy.
0:30:46.720000 - 0:30:47.800000::He was saying he like,
0:30:47.800000 - 0:30:49.880000::lots of people like, oh yeah, he's kind of the prankster.
0:30:49.880000 - 0:30:51::Crazy ass prank.
0:30:51 - 0:30:52.440000::Some people, good God.
0:30:53.400000 - 0:30:54.920000::The Michael Jackson prank show.
0:30:54.920000 - 0:30:55.800000::That's what we could have,
0:30:55.800000 - 0:30:57.200000::that's what we're missing out on
0:30:57.200000 - 0:30:58.400000::by him not being a library.
0:30:58.400000 - 0:31:00.840000::That, that, and that plays the juice.
0:31:00.840000 - 0:31:03.360000::Remember that show?
0:31:03.360000 - 0:31:05::No, what was that?
0:31:05 - 0:31:07.840000::You don't know about OJ's juice?
0:31:08.880000 - 0:31:09.720000::I don't think so.
0:31:09.720000 - 0:31:11.480000::Is the prank show that he hosted
0:31:11.480000 - 0:31:14.760000::after the killings in like the late 90s?
0:31:14.760000 - 0:31:16.440000::Have you not seen this?
0:31:16.440000 - 0:31:17.280000::No.
0:31:18.560000 - 0:31:21.760000::And basically the prank in every single one is just like,
0:31:21.760000 - 0:31:25.120000::random situations and then OJ Simpson shows up.
0:31:25.120000 - 0:31:27.240000::And he's still people are like still scared of him
0:31:27.240000 - 0:31:29.320000::because it's like so close to the killing.
0:31:30.320000 - 0:31:31.880000::It was, it's wild.
0:31:31.880000 - 0:31:33.240000::I don't know how they made that.
0:31:34.480000 - 0:31:37.160000::But, oh, you were telling me that Michael Jackson
0:31:37.160000 - 0:31:39.360000::wanted to buy all of Marvel.
0:31:39.360000 - 0:31:41.400000::And you're saying he was kind of a...
0:31:42.520000 - 0:31:45.080000::He's all, he could see into the future, I think.
0:31:45.080000 - 0:31:49.240000::He was tapped into some different kinetic energy.
0:31:49.240000 - 0:31:52.240000::Have I said kinetic energy, 14 times?
0:31:52.240000 - 0:31:53.560000::I know. I haven't heard you say it one.
0:31:53.560000 - 0:31:54.400000::I haven't heard you say it one.
0:31:54.520000 - 0:31:56.360000::I've been saying kinetic energy too much.
0:31:56.360000 - 0:31:57.200000::I don't even know.
0:31:57.200000 - 0:31:58.600000::Well, there's a lot of kinetic energy going on
0:31:58.600000 - 0:32:00.840000::in this podcast right now because we're clicking.
0:32:00.840000 - 0:32:02.760000::We're firing on all the cylinders.
0:32:02.760000 - 0:32:05.720000::And we should say Jack has stepped away again
0:32:05.720000 - 0:32:08.440000::to what have I deal with his tummy?
0:32:08.440000 - 0:32:12.920000::Yes, but he's going to text in opinions and we're...
0:32:12.920000 - 0:32:14.240000::From, from the state.
0:32:14.240000 - 0:32:17.040000::We're talking about Brett Ratner, Michael Jackson and Mark Kelly.
0:32:20.480000 - 0:32:21.480000::What the fuck, guys?
0:32:22.480000 - 0:32:25.640000::No, but Michael Jackson, he saw into the future
0:32:25.640000 - 0:32:26.720000::and he said, I'm going to buy...
0:32:26.720000 - 0:32:30.040000::Right before he was going to die, he was going to buy all of Marvel.
0:32:30.040000 - 0:32:32.480000::Before Marvel did the movies or anything like that,
0:32:32.480000 - 0:32:37.160000::he was going to buy all of the Marvel universe.
0:32:37.160000 - 0:32:39.720000::And he was like, it's so ripe for movies
0:32:39.720000 - 0:32:43.360000::and they'll have theme parks and the merch and all that stuff.
0:32:43.360000 - 0:32:44.520000::And he was like, the money...
0:32:44.520000 - 0:32:46.320000::It was an interview with his business manager.
0:32:46.320000 - 0:32:47.480000::He was like, the money was there.
0:32:47.480000 - 0:32:49.920000::Like, they had already done all the deal,
0:32:49.920000 - 0:32:51.920000::but then he passed away and he couldn't.
0:32:51.920000 - 0:32:53.920000::So Michael Jackson could have owned the...
0:32:53.920000 - 0:32:55.600000::He had died, by the way.
0:32:55.600000 - 0:32:58.080000::I think through Fettino.
0:32:58.080000 - 0:32:58.920000::That was pretty...
0:32:58.920000 - 0:33:01.280000::Did you see his fucking, his...
0:33:03.040000 - 0:33:06.160000::His doctor was like putting him on the craziest type of pills.
0:33:06.160000 - 0:33:11.480000::Like, he was on like the morphine that...
0:33:11.480000 - 0:33:13.200000::Like, it was called Demarol.
0:33:13.200000 - 0:33:15.200000::It's like the...
0:33:15.200000 - 0:33:18.200000::And he talks about it in a song where he's like,
0:33:18.320000 - 0:33:21.760000::Demarol, oh god, he's on Demarol.
0:33:23.360000 - 0:33:24.560000::Michael Jackson does?
0:33:24.560000 - 0:33:25.560000::Yeah, yeah, yeah.
0:33:25.560000 - 0:33:26.840000::It's a small...
0:33:26.840000 - 0:33:28.560000::It's a song that is not a hit,
0:33:28.560000 - 0:33:31.320000::but he's like singing his heart out about Demarol.
0:33:31.320000 - 0:33:34.520000::He liked it or he was afraid to buy it.
0:33:34.520000 - 0:33:35.040000::No, no.
0:33:35.040000 - 0:33:36.920000::He was on like a high dosage of it.
0:33:36.920000 - 0:33:38.320000::And I think it was like a...
0:33:38.320000 - 0:33:42.400000::It was like, I think it's like a really high...
0:33:42.400000 - 0:33:42.920000::I don't know.
0:33:42.920000 - 0:33:46.440000::It's like morphine basically, like a crazier morphine.
0:33:46.480000 - 0:33:48.560000::He was on like every type of medication
0:33:48.560000 - 0:33:51::you can possibly be on, basically.
0:33:51 - 0:33:53::And I think his body just couldn't handle it
0:33:53 - 0:33:54.280000::because he was just like...
0:33:55.600000 - 0:33:56.440000::You know.
0:33:56.440000 - 0:33:57.440000::It was over.

0:34:13.040000 - 0:34:13.880000::This was a while ago.
0:34:13.880000 - 0:34:15.840000::I said, O.J. Simpson.
0:34:15.840000 - 0:34:18.840000::And he just texted a meme of...
0:34:20.240000 - 0:34:21.680000::Mr. O.J.
0:34:21.680000 - 0:34:24.520000::O.J. that says, hide your kids, hide your wife.
0:34:24.520000 - 0:34:25.520000::Your wives.
0:34:26.880000 - 0:34:27.880000::hilarious.

0:34:31.640000 - 0:34:32.640000::I think he did.
0:34:32.640000 - 0:34:33.480000::Isn't that like...
0:34:33.480000 - 0:34:35.840000::I think he had something to do with it, right?
0:34:35.840000 - 0:34:36.840000::I didn't really follow that.
0:34:36.840000 - 0:34:37.680000::I didn't.
0:34:38.640000 - 0:34:39.800000::What's that?
0:34:39.800000 - 0:34:41.560000::No way he didn't have nothing to do with it.
0:34:41.560000 - 0:34:42.400000::Oh yeah.
0:34:42.400000 - 0:34:43.560000::I'm saying I agree.

0:38:26.960000 - 0:38:31.300000::get addicted to being on a music stage because we've been on acting stages
0:38:31.300000 - 0:38:35.900000::comedy but I've never felt the heat of a real how that's there for a band before
0:38:35.900000 - 0:38:41.140000::real truest biggest high on the planet you might be bad for you Eric in a way to
0:38:41.140000 - 0:38:45.100000::feel that I have such an addictive personality but I'm addicted to attention and
0:38:45.100000 - 0:38:48.820000::I'm addicted to different types of attention and this is one of the types of
0:38:48.820000 - 0:38:55.380000::attention that's very rare musical admiration this is so sick because finally
0:38:55.380000 - 0:39:00.700000::music and music and comedy have been so separate for decades why the hell is
0:39:00.700000 - 0:39:05.900000::that except for musical flight and except for the flight of the concords I
0:39:05.900000 - 0:39:12.740000::remember my dad told me this recently where he he was like you know I came to
0:39:12.740000 - 0:39:18.140000::some of your earlier shows when you were first doing comedy in college and I
0:39:18.140000 - 0:39:24.220000::told your stepmother like on the way back like we were kind of talking about
0:39:24.220000 - 0:39:28.900000::how maybe this isn't for Nate you know like maybe this isn't something he
0:39:28.900000 - 0:39:37.540000::should be pursuing yeah and I just thought I was so funny how like how
0:39:37.540000 - 0:39:41.780000::honest he was about that there's something about you can only succeed in this
0:39:41.780000 - 0:39:48.900000::stuff if you have some sort of blind faith in yourself blind right right right
0:39:48.900000 - 0:39:52.940000::right I was just thinking about this earlier today when I was in my kind of 30
0:39:52.940000 - 0:39:59.660000::year old post post drinking existential type of crisis I was like damn like I used
0:39:59.660000 - 0:40:00.860000::to

0:40:00 - 0:40:07.720000::fucking suck so bad at comedy like like so horribly badly and
0:40:08.480000 - 0:40:11.680000::Everyone has to go through that period. So when I see some younger
0:40:12.480000 - 0:40:18.180000::Type comedian or something and I see somebody not doing too well. I have the
0:40:18.880000 - 0:40:23.840000::The most amount of empathy for that person and I will give them the benefit out
0:40:23.840000 - 0:40:29.420000::And I'm like you want they might if they keep going at this they might be the most hilarious as person on the fucking planet and
0:40:29.700000 - 0:40:34.780000::Three years that they keep going with this shit. So I'm never writing anybody off. So if you bomb in front of me
0:40:35.020000 - 0:40:39.360000::It's all good. It's all right. I'm writing you the fuck up. If you bomb in front of me, it's one chance
0:40:40.940000 - 0:40:45.760000::That's it you get nothing else about 10 seconds to make that pressure
0:40:46.580000 - 0:40:48.580000::And then it's over
0:40:49.300000 - 0:40:51.820000::And me and I give people too many things these days
0:40:52.540000 - 0:40:56.020000::I'm just thinking about inventions god damn. I got a lot of ideas
0:40:57.020000 - 0:41:02.900000::I mean if you could make one invention right now, what would it be it would be an outfit where steam comes out of it
0:41:04.300000 - 0:41:07.920000::I am so smart because it's like doesn't wrinkle
0:41:08.460000 - 0:41:11.940000::No, it's not cuz of wrinkling though that is part of an amazing feature of it
0:41:11.940000 - 0:41:18.060000::But the point is that you could walk around with a smoke barrier and have yellow smoke coming off your shoulders every time
0:41:18.060000 - 0:41:23.740000::You try and go in for coffee and you go who's this? Hey, what's your name at Starbucks? Can I get a name yellow smoke?
0:41:24.300000 - 0:41:26.300000::Like you don't even you know what I'm saying like
0:41:27.020000 - 0:41:30.980000::It feels like it should be so easy to make smoke come off you at all times. I'll drop it
0:41:30.980000 - 0:41:33.460000::I'll drop it and I don't want to reveal my business ideas
0:41:34.420000 - 0:41:39.260000::Right, that's I mean you you've already revealed too much. I feel like you've made a couple of real layers
0:41:39.260000 - 0:41:41.260000::I feel like yeah
0:41:42.180000 - 0:41:46.620000::And also like open source every bit of information that I say you know
0:41:46.780000 - 0:41:51.300000::We're not giving I gave out my fucking genius idea on this fucking podcast and I was pissed about it
0:41:51.300000 - 0:41:54.100000::What was it for to dip into other people's feeds?
0:41:54.660000 - 0:41:58.680000::Somebody is gonna somebody these are crazy. Oh, that is a genius. That is a
0:41:58.680000 - 0:42:01.820000::G it genius idea. You could go into Jonah Hills
0:42:01.820000 - 0:42:07.780000::But you would have the most psychopathic people behind those subscriptions trying to get in Chris Evans feed
0:42:07.780000 - 0:42:13.460000::Get a taste away. It's taste to what he's seeing every day getting to peer to elect those feed and see what he's
