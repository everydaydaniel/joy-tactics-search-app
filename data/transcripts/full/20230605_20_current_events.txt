0:00:03.880000 - 0:00:05.080000::It depends on what friend group you're in,
0:00:05.080000 - 0:00:08.400000::but our friend group thinks five inches is pretty small.

0:00:40.200000 - 0:00:47.200000::And damn, damn, damn.
0:00:47.200000 - 0:00:49.240000::Whoa.
0:00:49.240000 - 0:00:53.480000::Yo, I was going to have to do all this shit if we just
0:00:53.480000 - 0:00:56.200000::did cocaine on a regular basis.
0:00:56.200000 - 0:00:57.040000::Yeah.
0:00:57.040000 - 0:00:57.560000::I know.
0:00:57.560000 - 0:00:59.760000::Coke heads can just, that's what they do.
0:00:59.760000 - 0:01:01.600000::They're just like, they can turn it on.
0:01:01.600000 - 0:01:01.960000::I know.
0:01:01.960000 - 0:01:03.560000::I don't do that.
0:01:03.560000 - 0:01:06.320000::That stuff.
0:01:06.320000 - 0:01:09.200000::So what's today's episode?
0:01:09.200000 - 0:01:11.120000::People have been asking us like, we like you.
0:01:11.120000 - 0:01:13.360000::I was podcasting you guys seem to talk a lot and just kind
0:01:13.360000 - 0:01:15::of vibe out and whatever.
0:01:15 - 0:01:16.720000::They're like, we want to get some news, though,
0:01:16.720000 - 0:01:20.640000::because everybody that delivers us news through traditional media
0:01:20.640000 - 0:01:22.440000::is delivering it so badly.
0:01:22.440000 - 0:01:23.640000::And we have a hunch.
0:01:23.640000 - 0:01:25.400000::This is what I'm getting my DMs.
0:01:25.400000 - 0:01:28.080000::It says, we have a hunch that you guys could deliver the news
0:01:28.080000 - 0:01:30.440000::in an amazing way.
0:01:30.440000 - 0:01:32.400000::And so it's so weird.
0:01:32.400000 - 0:01:32.920000::Yeah.
0:01:32.920000 - 0:01:36.800000::I've been getting similar DMs about just regular people
0:01:36.800000 - 0:01:39.920000::complaining about the news in their lives.
0:01:39.920000 - 0:01:44.560000::Like, what if, what if you guys, you know,
0:01:44.560000 - 0:01:45.680000::read off some headlines?
0:01:45.680000 - 0:01:48.320000::I'd like to see your take on a reason media.
0:01:48.320000 - 0:01:50.880000::Nate, that's, that's fucking funny.
0:01:50.880000 - 0:01:54.760000::Because lately, I've been getting DMs of all of these people
0:01:54.760000 - 0:01:59.560000::from basically one person from each state of the continental US
0:01:59.560000 - 0:02:01.800000::saying, hey, Jack, what's up?
0:02:01.800000 - 0:02:02.840000::I'm reading the news every day.
0:02:02.840000 - 0:02:04.880000::It's making me want to kill my KMS.
0:02:04.880000 - 0:02:07.160000::I don't say what that stands for, but it's dark.
0:02:07.160000 - 0:02:11.120000::Would you please take a crack at it, you know,
0:02:11.120000 - 0:02:12.800000::and more innocently?
0:02:12.800000 - 0:02:15.960000::So to sum it up, everybody wants us to dig into the news
0:02:15.960000 - 0:02:19.440000::and give us kind of a different fucking take on this shit.
0:02:19.440000 - 0:02:21.800000::Because we don't, what is a news anchor?
0:02:21.800000 - 0:02:26.520000::A news anchor is just a person that reads basically,
0:02:26.520000 - 0:02:27.600000::and they look pretty.
0:02:27.600000 - 0:02:30.080000::Well, that's what it is today.
0:02:30.080000 - 0:02:33.320000::But it needs to be, remember why they call it that.
0:02:33.320000 - 0:02:37.800000::A news anchor, because they anchor your boat of truth
0:02:37.800000 - 0:02:42.200000::to the reality of the world, essentially, boat.
0:02:42.200000 - 0:02:44.120000::And let me remind people, because I don't know if I've
0:02:44.120000 - 0:02:47.840000::dropped this fact before, but I went to a liberal arts university
0:02:47.840000 - 0:02:51.720000::called Loyola University of Chicago, 2014 alumni.
0:02:52.200000 - 0:02:57.360000::And I studied there very, I studied there so hard,
0:02:57.360000 - 0:03:00.800000::and I studied journalism and communications
0:03:00.800000 - 0:03:03.840000::and theater minor, okay?
0:03:03.840000 - 0:03:04.680000::Wow.
0:03:04.680000 - 0:03:05.920000::You are the total package area.
0:03:05.920000 - 0:03:06.920000::I know, dude.
0:03:06.920000 - 0:03:09.640000::I mean, that's what the, I was, it was so weird to be torn
0:03:09.640000 - 0:03:12.560000::between two departments, we're like the journalism department
0:03:12.560000 - 0:03:14.080000::wanted me so bad.
0:03:14.080000 - 0:03:17.120000::And the theater department wanted me even more batter.
0:03:17.120000 - 0:03:19::It's where they draw on each other.
0:03:19 - 0:03:21.680000::It's real life draws some art draws from real life,
0:03:21.680000 - 0:03:26.280000::like who, you know, is chicken in the egg, essentially.
0:03:26.280000 - 0:03:28.880000::But to be honest, actually, I had a professor
0:03:28.880000 - 0:03:31.080000::in the communications department that was like a hard ass
0:03:31.080000 - 0:03:34.480000::former journalist pulled me aside after one of the radio.
0:03:34.480000 - 0:03:36.640000::We did like a radio news hour every morning,
0:03:36.640000 - 0:03:37.920000::for like three hours, you would like,
0:03:37.920000 - 0:03:40.120000::we'd like do the research in the morning,
0:03:40.120000 - 0:03:43.640000::and then go on air and deliver it like an anchor.
0:03:43.640000 - 0:03:44.480000::Yeah.
0:03:44.480000 - 0:03:47.440000::And I just was so fucking bad at it, I would laugh every single
0:03:48.440000 - 0:03:50.920000::single time I was delivering the news, whatever.
0:03:50.920000 - 0:03:52.520000::And I had her pull me aside.
0:03:52.520000 - 0:03:53.960000::Bitch, man.
0:03:53.960000 - 0:03:55.560000::You silly goofy son of a bitch.
0:03:55.560000 - 0:03:57.920000::You lucky got into comedy if comedy didn't exist.
0:03:57.920000 - 0:03:59.120000::People would be mad at you, man.
0:03:59.120000 - 0:04:00.320000::You're lucky son of a gun.
0:04:00.320000 - 0:04:02::No, he would be a viral on.
0:04:02 - 0:04:03.080000::Yeah, I know.
0:04:03.080000 - 0:04:06.760000::With the loopers, these viral, but my journalism professor
0:04:06.760000 - 0:04:09.400000::pulled me aside and said, you're not built for this dude.
0:04:09.400000 - 0:04:09.920000::You are not.
0:04:09.920000 - 0:04:10.880000::You will never be.
0:04:10.880000 - 0:04:13.080000::She basically said like, unless you get this together,
0:04:13.080000 - 0:04:14.760000::you will never be a serious journalist.
0:04:14.760000 - 0:04:16.120000::Everybody else, that's the class.
0:04:16.120000 - 0:04:17.120000::She's a suicide.
0:04:17.120000 - 0:04:19.880000::And I left feeling for some reason, I didn't even want
0:04:19.880000 - 0:04:22.040000::it that bad, but I left feeling like she's fucking right.
0:04:22.040000 - 0:04:23.360000::I'll never be a journalist.
0:04:23.360000 - 0:04:27.080000::Well, today we're proving her wrong.
0:04:27.080000 - 0:04:30.840000::By the way, my guidance counselor in high school,
0:04:30.840000 - 0:04:35::she pulled me aside and said, hey, you're in a lot of trouble
0:04:35 - 0:04:35.760000::lately.
0:04:35.760000 - 0:04:37.600000::You're not standing for the national anthem.
0:04:37.600000 - 0:04:39.280000::You're talking back to people.
0:04:39.280000 - 0:04:41.760000::And I'll put it bluntly, you've gained weight.
0:04:41.760000 - 0:04:43.080000::You've gotten big.
0:04:43.080000 - 0:04:45.440000::And you've gotten accepted to zero colleges.
0:04:45.440000 - 0:04:46.720000::Did she say that to you?
0:04:46.720000 - 0:04:47.240000::Yeah.
0:04:47.240000 - 0:04:48.680000::Did you gain weight in high school?
0:04:48.680000 - 0:04:52.520000::Yeah, I guess I gained weight senior year and she told me that.
0:04:52.520000 - 0:04:54.440000::But guess what?
0:04:54.440000 - 0:04:57.960000::I did get into college after not going to college
0:04:57.960000 - 0:04:59.720000::for the first year because I didn't get in.
0:04:59.720000 - 0:05:00.720000::So good.

0:05:00 - 0:05:00.840000::Guess what?
0:05:00.840000 - 0:05:02.080000::And then I did drop out, but guess what?
0:05:02.080000 - 0:05:04.040000::That depends who asked me.
0:05:04.040000 - 0:05:08.280000::If I want you to think I did graduate or not, I will lie.
0:05:09.440000 - 0:05:10.280000::So.
0:05:10.280000 - 0:05:12.040000::The thing is, a college means nothing right now.
0:05:12.040000 - 0:05:15.040000::And these professors think they have such a hold over us.
0:05:15.040000 - 0:05:19.560000::They thought that they knew exactly what is in the cards for us,
0:05:19.560000 - 0:05:20.560000::but guess what?
0:05:20.560000 - 0:05:23.160000::Nobody checks that shit on resume.
0:05:23.160000 - 0:05:24.920000::You don't learn anything in college.
0:05:24.920000 - 0:05:25.920000::It's pointless now.
0:05:25.920000 - 0:05:28.840000::So if you're going to college, drop out right now.
0:05:28.840000 - 0:05:30.840000::And if your parents have some trouble with it,
0:05:30.840000 - 0:05:33.800000::just send them this podcast and tell them how credible we are
0:05:33.800000 - 0:05:36.480000::and how we know what we're talking about, how successful
0:05:36.480000 - 0:05:38.080000::we are in our lives.
0:05:38.080000 - 0:05:41.280000::And I think that they'll understand.
0:05:41.280000 - 0:05:43.240000::One time I had a philosophy professor
0:05:43.240000 - 0:05:45.320000::that I overheard making fun of me to the TA.
0:05:45.320000 - 0:05:48.800000::What?
0:05:48.800000 - 0:05:49.080000::Why?
0:05:49.080000 - 0:05:49.920000::For what?
0:05:49.920000 - 0:05:53.480000::Because I came into college thinking I was such hot.
0:05:53.480000 - 0:05:55.880000::Because I was on Vivance and my mind brain was all
0:05:55.880000 - 0:05:58.120000::at old and I'd stay up all night writing.
0:05:58.120000 - 0:05:59.560000::I would go way over the page,
0:05:59.560000 - 0:06:01.760000::element like right way too much.
0:06:01.760000 - 0:06:02.760000::So holy crap.
0:06:02.760000 - 0:06:04.040000::I messed out.
0:06:04.040000 - 0:06:06.160000::And I thought I was crushing it.
0:06:06.160000 - 0:06:08.840000::And I started getting all these C-minuses and whatever.
0:06:08.840000 - 0:06:10.720000::And I heard it making fun of me.
0:06:10.720000 - 0:06:12.320000::And that aren't my feelings badly.
0:06:12.320000 - 0:06:14.520000::And you know, I have been doing to all my professors
0:06:14.520000 - 0:06:16.240000::that underestimated me.
0:06:16.240000 - 0:06:17.200000::Drogging them.
0:06:17.200000 - 0:06:21::I have been sending them the highlight clips from my four lines.
0:06:21 - 0:06:22.600000::And I think you should leave.
0:06:22.600000 - 0:06:24.320000::Wow.
0:06:24.320000 - 0:06:25.320000::Did the highlight ring.
0:06:25.320000 - 0:06:26.640000::I'm sending it as myself.
0:06:26.640000 - 0:06:30.640000::I'm sending it from like a sort of anonymous V for Vivant.
0:06:30.640000 - 0:06:32.240000::It's like so clear.
0:06:32.240000 - 0:06:33.960000::Yes, so clear to you.
0:06:33.960000 - 0:06:34.480000::Oh, dude.
0:06:34.480000 - 0:06:38.280000::And I think you think you know what I mean.
0:06:38.280000 - 0:06:39.520000::And I've been doing the same thing.
0:06:39.520000 - 0:06:42.240000::I send my guidance counselor clips from tuning out the news,
0:06:42.240000 - 0:06:45.120000::showing them how buff my cartoon character is that I play.
0:06:45.120000 - 0:06:49::So that fucking shows her how big I'm fat I got.
0:06:49 - 0:06:51.040000::I'm going to show you how fat I am.
0:06:51.040000 - 0:06:52.200000::How fat I am.
0:06:52.200000 - 0:06:54.080000::How does that?
0:06:54.080000 - 0:06:54.840000::OK.
0:06:54.840000 - 0:06:57.720000::Well, that's the TikTok for those who are Gen Z.
0:06:57.720000 - 0:07:02.240000::I'm going to show you how great I am.
0:07:02.240000 - 0:07:02.880000::Macklemore.
0:07:02.880000 - 0:07:03.480000::That's Macklemore.
0:07:03.480000 - 0:07:05.400000::Shout out to Macklemore.
0:07:05.400000 - 0:07:08.880000::Basically, the reverse version of what 2016 was when
0:07:08.880000 - 0:07:13.680000::Macklemore came out in whatever 2012.
0:07:13.680000 - 0:07:18.520000::It was not a dumpster fire, but a dumpster celebration.
0:07:18.520000 - 0:07:20.600000::So let's get into the news here.

0:09:20 - 0:09:21::I don't want to hear it.
0:09:21 - 0:09:22.800000::Evan and the chipmunks, where are they at?

0:09:30.480000 - 0:09:37.600000::It would be great if somebody that you know already had that, but weirdly there's never

0:10:24.240000 - 0:10:26.200000::As a bait as a child, the breaker.
0:10:26.200000 - 0:10:26.800000::Oh, wait a minute.
0:10:26.960000 - 0:10:31.560000::Well, is that a, is that an angle maybe to go into the news is like in good news
0:10:31.560000 - 0:10:35.800000::today, you are not the person, the beloved man who died by suicide.
0:10:36.160000 - 0:10:37.680000::And you are not, oh, yeah.
0:10:37.680000 - 0:10:38.680000::That's the end.
0:10:38.680000 - 0:10:42.160000::And you're not going to find out what his widow wants others to understand.

0:10:51.720000 - 0:10:54.120000::No, this is a work of a lot of people.
0:10:54.160000 - 0:10:55.320000::No, this is a loophole.
0:10:55.320000 - 0:10:56.120000::That's a lazy way.
0:10:56.680000 - 0:11:01.240000::Here, I just found a, I just found a miracle website that must have been designed by God
0:11:01.240000 - 0:11:02.040000::or some angels.
0:11:02.040000 - 0:11:04.760000::It's called the good news network.org holy crap.
0:11:04.920000 - 0:11:09.280000::And literally, in the headline is not an advertisement.
0:11:09.280000 - 0:11:10.240000::This is crazy.
0:11:10.240000 - 0:11:11.520000::All of these companies are so greedy.
0:11:11.520000 - 0:11:15.960000::They're filling these pages with ads, trying to suck money from your interest in death and pain.
0:11:16.680000 - 0:11:22.800000::This website, instead of a news, instead of an ad, whatever, it's a quote by Voltaire, the go.
0:11:23.040000 - 0:11:26.880000::It's and it says judge a man by his questions rather than his answers.
0:11:27.760000 - 0:11:30.840000::What the hell Voltaire is the fucking.
0:11:30.840000 - 0:11:32.640000::Oh, I always said that.
0:11:32.640000 - 0:11:33.720000::The goat is Lebron.
0:11:34.200000 - 0:11:35::It's Voltaire.
0:11:35.240000 - 0:11:35.640000::Nope.
0:11:35.680000 - 0:11:38.120000::It's Voltaire, the man who invented thinking.
0:11:38.880000 - 0:11:42.320000::I always thought Voltaire sounded like a techian character, like a,
0:11:42.760000 - 0:11:48.760000::a soul caliber type character, but he was just a regular man that had a bigger brain than the rest of us.
0:11:49.360000 - 0:11:51.920000::But you guys want to hear some of these things from good news network.
0:11:51.920000 - 0:11:53.080000::I need it.
0:11:54.840000 - 0:11:55.240000::Okay.
0:11:55.240000 - 0:11:56::Well, here's one.
0:11:56 - 0:11:56.480000::It's drawn.
0:11:56.800000 - 0:11:57.240000::Okay.
0:11:57.360000 - 0:11:57.760000::This one.
0:11:57.760000 - 0:11:58.440000::I don't know.
0:11:58.440000 - 0:11:59.800000::This one seems a little scary.
0:12:00.840000 - 0:12:07.480000::Astronomers discover hundreds of mysterious filaments pointing towards our Milky Way's black, massive black hole.
0:12:07.800000 - 0:12:08.520000::Is that hair?
0:12:11.360000 - 0:12:12.520000::I don't fucking know what is that.
0:12:12.520000 - 0:12:13.400000::What is a filament?
0:12:13.680000 - 0:12:14.640000::Oh, I see one.
0:12:14.680000 - 0:12:15.320000::Look at this.
0:12:15.360000 - 0:12:16.280000::You see a filament?
0:12:16.880000 - 0:12:17.640000::No, no, no.
0:12:17.680000 - 0:12:18.720000::This is another headline.
0:12:18.720000 - 0:12:22.720000::First recorded stand-up comedy sketch from 500 years ago,
0:12:22.720000 - 0:12:25.440000::discovered in 15th century manures.
0:12:26.960000 - 0:12:27.680000::I think it would.
0:12:27.680000 - 0:12:28.320000::It could be.
0:12:28.320000 - 0:12:28.560000::Yeah.
0:12:28.560000 - 0:12:29.280000::Can we hear it?
0:12:29.280000 - 0:12:30.280000::Is that an ancient?
0:12:30.960000 - 0:12:32.840000::The ancient, I think you should leave sketch.
0:12:33.880000 - 0:12:35.320000::Going crazy back in.
0:12:35.840000 - 0:12:37.440000::I think, wait, how many years ago?
0:12:38.400000 - 0:12:38.920000::Five.
0:12:38.920000 - 0:12:39.440000::Five.
0:12:39.440000 - 0:12:40.800000::Oh, my God.
0:12:40.800000 - 0:12:45.560000::We were just getting fingers and toes at that point in terms of how long we were around.
0:12:45.600000 - 0:12:50.200000::No, 500 years ago, somebody was already swimming well on their way,
0:12:50.200000 - 0:12:51.200000::swimming over to America.
0:12:53.480000 - 0:12:56.400000::So that was probably about something relatable.
0:12:56.400000 - 0:12:57.960000::Does it say what this sketch is about?
0:12:58.680000 - 0:12:59.680000::Hello, I'm British.
0:12:59.680000 - 0:13:00.680000::I'm British.
0:13:01.320000 - 0:13:08.760000::It says reminiscent of Monty Python's killer rabbit sketch in their film Monty Python and the whole at grill.
0:13:09.160000 - 0:13:10.360000::Oh, that's a hunting.
0:13:10.960000 - 0:13:15.480000::Oh, it's like the hunting of the hair is a rhyming.
0:13:15.480000 - 0:13:16.920000::Burlesque romance.

0:13:20.080000 - 0:13:22.240000::They're not really going into the much of the detail.
0:13:23 - 0:13:25.240000::So it's a burlesque freestyle about rabbits.
0:13:25.240000 - 0:13:28.840000::What did they play this right after the fucking execution for sure?
0:13:28.840000 - 0:13:32.640000::It would be execution first up first set of the night is one execution.
0:13:33.040000 - 0:13:34.480000::I was like, then you get a sketch.
0:13:34.680000 - 0:13:36.920000::Then you get a fucking tomato stomping.
0:13:37.560000 - 0:13:39.680000::Whatever tomato stomping.
0:13:41.480000 - 0:13:43.680000::Yeah, yeah, tomatoes were really funny.
0:13:44.080000 - 0:13:46.440000::Tomatoes were the iPhones of the first 2000 years.
0:13:46.720000 - 0:13:48.960000::Oh, you could look at that thing suck on it.
0:13:48.960000 - 0:13:49.400000::Taste it.
0:13:49.400000 - 0:13:50::Suck on it.
0:13:50 - 0:13:51.360000::Throw what you can't taste the phone.
0:13:51.680000 - 0:13:54.120000::No, you want to come over and suck on some tomatoes.
0:13:54.120000 - 0:13:56.640000::Throw up a full tomato spit it in some of them.
0:13:57.240000 - 0:13:59.760000::So I have a question of really sidebar Eric.
0:14:00.560000 - 0:14:01.840000::You use the word execution.

0:14:10.560000 - 0:14:10.920000::Okay.
0:14:11.920000 - 0:14:13.480000::That is a good question.
0:14:13.480000 - 0:14:16.960000::I've been wondering for years, dude, and I don't think anybody has an answer.
0:14:16.960000 - 0:14:17.720000::All right.

0:25:12.080000 - 0:25:16.760000::Understanding is you get reincarnated as the nearest most recently born thing
0:25:16.760000 - 0:25:21.680000::Well, that's just science if electricity comes off of a battery it grounds on to the most conducting thing nearby
0:25:21.920000 - 0:25:25::So damn and I don't mean to make it and that yeah, that's right
0:25:25 - 0:25:29.640000::And I know sometimes you are you are just so quick with this. I'm not kidding dude
0:25:30 - 0:25:36.040000::There's a genius. Here's why because I'm very this is what but I could if I could summarize my brain
0:25:36.280000 - 0:25:39::I'm very smart. I just don't know any
0:25:39.920000 - 0:25:47.440000::Anything solid so I could figure something out, but not anything that is real or matters or exists
0:25:47.760000 - 0:25:50.240000::So I don't know if that even had sense
0:25:50.640000 - 0:25:54.560000::But here's the thing I only speak on this topic so
0:25:55.400000 - 0:26:03.040000::Humorously and not only because I know that we're a comedy podcast and I want to make sure that people are
0:26:03.560000 - 0:26:05.920000::You know entertained but the truth is
0:26:07.280000 - 0:26:13.760000::If people find out that reincarnation is real that's the type of thing we're gonna have to start worrying about
0:26:13.960000 - 0:26:16.440000::Once people find out what the afterlife is
0:26:16.880000 - 0:26:19.100000::We're gonna have to start worrying about you know
0:26:19.100000 - 0:26:21.560000::Is that a sweeter deal than what I have now? Am I gonna?
0:26:21.800000 - 0:26:24.800000::You know who's gonna be in the workforce if they're all like well shit
0:26:24.960000 - 0:26:31.680000::Would I rather work for six dollars an hour making trying to fucking sell sandwiches at the pool or would I rather?
0:26:32.480000 - 0:26:37.160000::Just choke myself out right here and now with my own arms wrap around my fucking neck
0:26:37.400000 - 0:26:40.960000::Yeah, next thing you know, I'm gonna wake up and I'm gonna be in a pool of gelatin
0:26:40.960000 - 0:26:45.200000::I can flip and coins and eat them because gold is edible and if you in heaven
0:26:46.320000 - 0:26:50.320000::Crazy possum. I mean so religion actually has a larger responsibility
0:26:50.320000 - 0:26:55.360000::Then we realize which is to make sure we better for everybody's sake
0:26:55.360000 - 0:26:58.480000::We better make sure that nobody finds out what is next and
0:26:59.680000 - 0:27:05.260000::Yeah, I mean here's my thing is I think my hunch and what I've known since I was a child before I knew what reincarnation was
0:27:05.260000 - 0:27:12.100000::I knew my past life so well right and I have been around since the beginning some people are new guys are pretty new
0:27:12.100000 - 0:27:19.340000::Souls I could tell I have been fucking cursed and burdened with being a human being for millions of years right as we're evolving
0:27:19.340000 - 0:27:24.620000::I got consciousness first whatever I was there with the Romans the Egyptians the fucking Greeks though fucking the Ottomans
0:27:25.140000 - 0:27:31.360000::Everybody through Europe. I've seen so much and sometimes it's a short life. Sometimes I'm a child soldier that goes crazy in the battlefield

0:32:04 - 0:32:09::The temple, the church of worshiping not.
0:32:09 - 0:32:16::We need to have a priest come on a high priest in some sort of orthodox type like religion.
0:32:16 - 0:32:20::Something that's like, you know, not a lot of people are a part of and we need them to
0:32:20 - 0:32:25::bless us and do some cyber ritual and ceremony on the podcast.
0:32:25 - 0:32:30::Russ and cleanse some sort of spirits in our bodies.
0:32:30 - 0:32:36::Are there monks you think that member from Dan Brown's trilogy, Mona Lisa's not

0:32:51 - 0:32:53::Does anybody still do that you think?
0:32:53 - 0:32:54::Oh, yeah.
0:32:54 - 0:32:57::I think people do that and some neighbors and Brooklyn too.
0:32:57 - 0:33:01::But being on the moon is like one of the worst lives you can possibly have.
0:33:01 - 0:33:05::Like it's, I think it's like torture and then for two years it's like at the end of your
0:33:05 - 0:33:12::life 89 through 92 is probably like you're just feeling like kind of good.
0:33:12 - 0:33:19::But it's worth it because it's like.
0:33:19 - 0:33:22::It just feels amazing for those like four years at the end.
0:33:22 - 0:33:24::I think we should get a taste of what they go.
0:33:24 - 0:33:28::I think they they I think we should get a taste of that like barbed wire getting wrapped around
0:33:28 - 0:33:32::our like some some to just like raise the stakes a little bit.
0:33:32 - 0:33:33::You know what I mean?
0:33:33 - 0:33:40::Well, you know they had back in the day they had you know rituals for like people becoming
0:33:40 - 0:33:44::men and women and they would have to go out into like 300 style.
0:33:44 - 0:33:46::They'd have to go out and like kill a wolf or something like that.
0:33:46 - 0:33:53::The walk about we would not have any we have we have a society filled of ritual ritual
0:33:53 - 0:33:55::this children.
0:33:55 - 0:33:56::That's a lot of.
0:33:56 - 0:33:59::And we know it's all floating.
0:33:59 - 0:34:03::That's why we're such children starting all these bitter fights with each other.
0:34:03 - 0:34:12::Everyone's petty because we haven't had to go out into the wilderness and you know had your your hands and legs tied up
0:34:12 - 0:34:19::and then they just like throw you out from a helicopter into the wilderness and get the crawl around and try to find like the nearest
0:34:19 - 0:34:22::dandelion and live off of that for three months.
0:34:22 - 0:34:27::So I don't know why you should do a video where you do every step of the way where you you play the elders that give you the mission.
0:34:27 - 0:34:32::You play you you put on makeup and give yourself a little wig so you're like a kid again and like any
0:34:32 - 0:34:36::trophy style like like a normal style like.
0:34:36 - 0:34:41::Yeah, and you got to go through this too because I think you are really missing that.
0:34:41 - 0:34:50::And Nate, once you go through it, I really think if you're open to this you should open this to the
0:34:50 - 0:34:51::community.
0:34:51 - 0:35:00::Basically offering a joy tactics barb bot mitzvah style service where you study at some book that Nate wrote about a bunch of stories about

0:35:00 - 0:35:05.080000::his life and what's happened to him and you study those stories and then you have a ceremony
0:35:05.080000 - 0:35:11.240000::where you read one of the stories of Nate's life and then Nate like fucking puts a bag
0:35:11.240000 - 0:35:15.440000::over your head, throws you in the back of an Uber, dries out.
0:35:15.440000 - 0:35:19.800000::I guess you maybe you have a car and then fucking drive out.
0:35:19.800000 - 0:35:20.800000::It's crazy.
0:35:20.800000 - 0:35:26.400000::And he fucking puts, puts roller blades on your feet and pour cement in them so you
0:35:26.400000 - 0:35:31.320000::can't get out and puts like a thumbtacks on your forehead so you can't scratch your
0:35:31.320000 - 0:35:34.880000::eyeball without getting all scratched up on your palms.
0:35:34.880000 - 0:35:38.880000::Just something that's basically saying, yep, now I'm a person.
0:35:38.880000 - 0:35:39.880000::Now I'm a human being.
0:35:39.880000 - 0:35:46.320000::Now I'm ready to enter the workforce and provide meaning to this world and not just sit around

0:36:52.560000 - 0:36:56.600000::I needed someone to fucking throw me around not you know what you know what I mean but

0:39:40.360000 - 0:39:45.800000::Here's another instance he said that he was a door to door magazine salesman and he
0:39:45.800000 - 0:39:52::one of the doors he knocked on was a group of prostitutes that had were crying because
0:39:52 - 0:39:58.200000::their pimp just got killed and he became their pimp like in there's kind of like Santa he
0:39:58.200000 - 0:39:59.840000::was like in like the Santa Claus.

0:40:00 - 0:40:01.840000::like, but the Pimp version of it.
0:40:01.840000 - 0:40:06.560000::And he just became their Pimp, which I don't know.
0:40:06.560000 - 0:40:09.960000::I was like, that sounds like kind of crazy that somebody would
0:40:10.960000 - 0:40:14.100000::trust the door to door salesmen to just all of a sudden get into the
0:40:14.100000 - 0:40:15.160000::Pimping industry.
0:40:16 - 0:40:20.880000::And what was the stuff about the FBI or like giving water to orphans
0:40:20.880000 - 0:40:23.360000::and, oh yeah, maybe Haiti or something?
0:40:24.040000 - 0:40:27.040000::He said he went on a mission trip for two years when he was like,
0:40:27.360000 - 0:40:31.040000::and he said he was in the Marines.
0:40:31.480000 - 0:40:31.840000::Right.
0:40:31.840000 - 0:40:35.560000::But they figured out after basic training that he was underage.
0:40:35.640000 - 0:40:36.840000::I was like, no way.
0:40:36.840000 - 0:40:40.520000::Like, he was like, they disbarred me after I went through basic training
0:40:40.520000 - 0:40:43.680000::because they figured out I was like 16.
0:40:43.680000 - 0:40:46.840000::And I was like, there's no way you could have gotten into basic training.
0:40:46.840000 - 0:40:49.200000::Like they, well, he's from a different time.
0:40:49.200000 - 0:40:49.880000::You're thinking about it.
0:40:49.880000 - 0:40:51.080000::Maybe I don't know.
0:40:51.080000 - 0:40:52.360000::Maybe he's from the 80s.
0:40:52.360000 - 0:40:54.040000::He is 66 years old.
0:40:54.040000 - 0:40:54.800000::No, he's not.
0:40:54.800000 - 0:40:56.720000::Cat Wimsy is not 66.
0:40:56.960000 - 0:40:57.960000::All right, he's 51.
0:40:57.960000 - 0:40:59.160000::But you could believe it.
0:40:59.960000 - 0:41:01.720000::You could believe it somehow.
0:41:01.960000 - 0:41:05.480000::Maybe he does have some of the funniest standup of all.
0:41:05.480000 - 0:41:07.360000::I want to say this.
0:41:07.360000 - 0:41:12.040000::I want to believe all that because that like cat Williams is hilarious.
0:41:12.040000 - 0:41:14.840000::And he's just lived a crazy.
0:41:15.440000 - 0:41:18.080000::Here's the fact he's definitely lived a crazy ass life.
0:41:18.080000 - 0:41:21.040000::That's different than a lot of people's.
0:41:21.040000 - 0:41:21.840000::You know what I'm saying?
0:41:21.840000 - 0:41:26.680000::And it's from a person and he and it seems like he had so many like crazy interactions.
0:41:26.680000 - 0:41:35.200000::As a kid that it just formed what you see today as the cat Williams that is, you know,
0:41:35.200000 - 0:41:38::but you guys have kind of turning on him.
0:41:38 - 0:41:41.600000::So did you guys have friends when you're, have we already talked about this in the podcast?
0:41:41.600000 - 0:41:46.160000::Did you guys have friends growing up that were like the most crazy liars of all time?
0:41:46.160000 - 0:41:47.160000::Yes.
0:41:47.160000 - 0:41:48.160000::Yes.
0:41:48.160000 - 0:41:53.440000::And I was the kid that believed every, you could lie to me a hundred times.
0:41:53.440000 - 0:41:56::And I'd be like, are you, you're kidding me, do you?
0:41:56 - 0:42:00.680000::You guys know, you guys know my most crazy thing that I believed when I was way too old.
0:42:00.680000 - 0:42:01.680000::What?
0:42:01.680000 - 0:42:07.600000::I, everybody here knows that I would go seeing at the retirement homes.
0:42:07.600000 - 0:42:09.720000::Go seeing the Christian.
0:42:09.720000 - 0:42:11.320000::I'm one of the most charitable.
0:42:11.320000 - 0:42:12.320000::Yeah.
0:42:12.320000 - 0:42:13.120000::One of the best things you could ever done.
0:42:13.120000 - 0:42:16.440000::And I did that with pride and I always wanted to go.
0:42:16.440000 - 0:42:20.440000::Anyways, one time one of the kids friends came along.
0:42:20.440000 - 0:42:24.280000::This random, like it was a homeschool of kids so that you know we're off to an interesting
0:42:24.280000 - 0:42:25.280000::start.
0:42:25.280000 - 0:42:26.680000::And he is talking to me.
0:42:26.680000 - 0:42:31.720000::He's a little older and he's like, dude, yeah, I'm here with my dragon right now, like
0:42:31.720000 - 0:42:33.720000::my dragon's right over there.
0:42:33.720000 - 0:42:35.040000::And I think I was like 11 years old.
0:42:35.040000 - 0:42:37.040000::I'm like, what are you talking about, dude?
0:42:37.040000 - 0:42:39.200000::It's just fucking hatched.
0:42:39.200000 - 0:42:42.400000::Like I'm the only one you can see it though.
0:42:42.400000 - 0:42:45.880000::Everybody has one if you, if you like, but I would have to give it.
0:42:45.880000 - 0:42:49.920000::And so he made it, he made it up this like home mythology about this like everybody gets
0:42:49.920000 - 0:42:52.920000::an invisible egg and you got to protect the egg.
0:42:52.920000 - 0:42:57.200000::And then when you're in an of age, the egg hatches and you get your own type of dragon
0:42:57.200000 - 0:43:00::and it might not be a dragon, it might be a different type of creature.
0:43:00 - 0:43:02.360000::And so he was like, you want the egg?
0:43:02.360000 - 0:43:07.400000::And for some reason, I believed every, every part of this and I went home and I was like
0:43:07.400000 - 0:43:14.320000::talking to the egg, put it under my bed and waiting for it to hatch and now it was invisible.
0:43:14.320000 - 0:43:21.080000::Also, the fucking, the child of doctors missed out on you as a kid.
0:43:21.080000 - 0:43:23::Like you must, you probably would have been the easiest.
0:43:23 - 0:43:24.160000::Oh my God.
0:43:24.160000 - 0:43:28.560000::The most pleasing like, hey, yeah, whatever, do whatever.
0:43:28.560000 - 0:43:31.720000::Oh snap, where were, yeah, yeah, I would have been there.
0:43:31.720000 - 0:43:36.320000::No, but I think about that now and think what was going on in my head?
0:43:36.320000 - 0:43:40.600000::Maybe two days later, I was like, oh, this might not be real.
0:43:40.600000 - 0:43:42.840000::But I, but I wanted to believe so badly.
0:43:42.840000 - 0:43:48.160000::Well, we're missing out on that right now as adults is that believing in the mystical
0:43:49.160000 - 0:43:52.960000::because you were just a little child that was just like, wow, like maybe there are
0:43:52.960000 - 0:43:54.160000::dragons, you know what I'm saying?
0:43:54.160000 - 0:43:59.400000::And now we hear anything that's a little bit incredulous like, you know, cat will
0:43:59.400000 - 0:44:03.680000::come in the Santa Claus fucking Pimp and we say, oh, that can't be true.
0:44:04.160000 - 0:44:05.280000::But you know what I'm saying?
0:44:05.280000 - 0:44:07.960000::Like, we have lost the magic we've lost.
0:44:07.960000 - 0:44:10.200000::We've lost the magic is out there.
0:44:10.200000 - 0:44:12.720000::And I'm saying, you know, I hate to go back to Harry Potter.
0:44:12.720000 - 0:44:16.320000::We haven't brought his ass up in a long time because people were sick of us talking about it.
0:44:16.840000 - 0:44:20.520000::But you know about what the people who can't do magic in Harry Potter are, right?
0:44:20.520000 - 0:44:21.200000::Muggles.
0:44:21.720000 - 0:44:24.680000::We have entered the world of muggles.
0:44:24.920000 - 0:44:25.360000::Okay.
0:44:25.360000 - 0:44:27.920000::And we're so satisfied living here and we don't give a fuck.
0:44:28.360000 - 0:44:30.560000::Can we rise up and bring the magic back?
0:44:30.560000 - 0:44:35.440000::Please, please, somebody and Ron DeSantis is trying to take it out of Florida by
0:44:35.440000 - 0:44:36.280000::taking Disney away.
0:44:36.480000 - 0:44:37.200000::You can't take that.
0:44:37.200000 - 0:44:38.400000::What the hell were they going to put it?
0:44:38.400000 - 0:44:41.080000::And I'll be right there with my fucking sword all sharpened.
0:44:41.280000 - 0:44:44.120000::If you try to get, if you're trying to break into Disney World and destroy it,

0:44:52.480000 - 0:44:54.720000::I will say this 100%.
0:44:54.720000 - 0:44:56.120000::It's done for your ass.

0:46:22.320000 - 0:46:23.360000::A cop
0:46:23.360000 - 0:46:30.640000::Not that I was being arrested, but we were wrestling in a sanctioned environment when I was training wrestling

0:47:10.080000 - 0:47:11.600000::but he
0:47:11.600000 - 0:47:13.600000::got a concussion while he was on
0:47:14.560000 - 0:47:16.560000::Snowboarding and
0:47:16.960000 - 0:47:20.400000::He had had a concussion before that so it's like easier to get a concussion
0:47:21.040000 - 0:47:28.080000::The you know the next time your head gets hit and he basically blacks out and is just kind of like sleep walking
0:47:28.880000 - 0:47:31.440000::Into the forest of this mountain
0:47:32.160000 - 0:47:38.480000::And he's like calling people on his phone. He's calling his dad and like talking about past lives and stuff like that
0:47:39.040000 - 0:47:42.720000::And he said he remembers chucking his phone like throwing it
0:47:43.440000 - 0:47:46.880000::And it's lost. He doesn't know where it's at he takes off his board
0:47:47.440000 - 0:47:51.280000::He takes off all of his clothes and is just wandering into the forest and
0:47:52.640000 - 0:47:54.640000::he uh is
0:47:54.960000 - 0:48:00.240000::This is like eight hours is going by as it's not good. He's completely blacked out like
0:48:00.800000 - 0:48:02.800000::Has no idea what's going on and
0:48:03.680000 - 0:48:12.400000::He eventually like gets to a highway and is flagging down cars and he said the first car seemed like a creep in
0:48:12.880000 - 0:48:17.520000::Even though he was in like an emaciated he could tell he was like he was like yeah, I'll take the next
0:48:18.960000 - 0:48:25.680000::Person that wants to help me. Oh my god. They eventually helped him and he had a he had a really high ambulance bill
0:48:26.080000 - 0:48:30.080000::Because they had to get in there. They get it from the mountain. They had to uh
0:48:30.080000 - 0:48:32.720000::No, he eventually made his way to like the side of a road
0:48:32.880000 - 0:48:34.960000::But he was like wandering through the forest like
0:48:35.680000 - 0:48:39.760000::With a blanket on and had lost all of his gear and everything but
0:48:40.240000 - 0:48:44.400000::Great he had hypothermia he had hypothermia and
0:48:45.200000 - 0:48:49.760000::I think he was at the edge of death because you know you're not supposed to sleep when you have a concussion and he went to bed
0:48:50.160000 - 0:48:55.520000::He was like he fell asleep for like a tiny second, but it's like I think he was like very close to
0:48:55.920000 - 0:49:03.760000::Oh god, so thank god. He's still here with us, but be careful that the snowboarding and these mountain sports just don't do it

0:50:16.880000 - 0:50:17.400000::Yeah.
0:50:18.240000 - 0:50:22.680000::The mountain that I grew up snowboarding on, it was like they had it, it was an old
0:50:22.680000 - 0:50:28.120000::operation. And so at least when I was going up, they used to have these old
0:50:28.120000 - 0:50:30.960000::chairs that were just the two seaters. Have you guys ever been on these?
0:50:30.960000 - 0:50:35.080000::And they're like so rickety. You know, now they have these like Cadillac
0:50:35.080000 - 0:50:40.600000::chair lifts that are like so smooth and the lever comes now or the, you know,
0:50:40.600000 - 0:50:42.320000::like pole comes down. You hold onto that.
0:50:42.560000 - 0:50:48.200000::These were just these rickety little like busted seat cushions like like steel
0:50:49.280000 - 0:50:50.960000::chairs and they were so and you could swing them.
0:50:50.960000 - 0:50:54.920000::Your friends could kind of swing it and you'd be like, and there's no bar.
0:50:54.920000 - 0:50:58.480000::I mean, if you fall off, it's that is at least a shattered fucking hip.
0:50:59.040000 - 0:50:59.600000::You want to mean,
0:50:59.600000 - 0:51:03.480000::points of fear and a, you know, going to do a trick on the way down.
0:51:03.600000 - 0:51:04.880000::Hey, right, right. Exactly.
0:51:05.320000 - 0:51:09.600000::And wait, Nate, the the past lives and the concussion makes me think of what
0:51:09.600000 - 0:51:14.280000::happened on the ship in Costa Rica. That's my favorite story of all time to that girl.
0:51:15.280000 - 0:51:16.320000::Wait, what was this?
0:51:16.320000 - 0:51:20.200000::I don't know. Well, do you remember we went on the, the booze crews in Costa Rica?
0:51:20.840000 - 0:51:21.320000::Oh, yeah.
0:51:21.320000 - 0:51:23.840000::And there were all those teens that were like fucked up on acid.
0:51:23.880000 - 0:51:25.840000::They must have been like 20, 21.
0:51:26.320000 - 0:51:27.200000::Oh, yeah, yeah.
0:51:27.640000 - 0:51:32.160000::And there was one girl we saw go out and these were all kind of like super hippie
0:51:32.160000 - 0:51:34.720000::type teens like backpacking in Costa Rica.
0:51:35.120000 - 0:51:37.240000::And the one girl goes out and she's looking out in the water.
0:51:37.240000 - 0:51:41.720000::And I think you or Danny heard her say like, I just, I just realized what my past
0:51:41.720000 - 0:51:44.880000::live was. And she was crying. Oh, yes.
0:51:44.880000 - 0:51:48.520000::Remember that. And then their friend, so they're all fucked up on acid, Jack, you know,
0:51:48.520000 - 0:51:49.400000::the story, do you know this?
0:51:49.560000 - 0:51:50.560000::I love it. Yeah.
0:51:51.280000 - 0:51:54.440000::And one of them is doing, they're all doing like flip.
0:51:54.440000 - 0:51:55.840000::We're jumping with a part the boat.
0:51:55.840000 - 0:51:58.680000::We're all doing jumps off the top of the ship into the water.
0:51:58.680000 - 0:52:00.120000::It's like maybe a 10 foot drop.
0:52:01.360000 - 0:52:05.280000::And this one girl, this one girl is like scared, but then ends up like doing a belly
0:52:05.280000 - 0:52:07.560000::flop kind of and smacks her head on the water.
0:52:08 - 0:52:09.760000::And when she, she's on acid.
0:52:10.040000 - 0:52:14.560000::And when she comes out of the water, blood is coming out of her, of her eyes.
0:52:14.560000 - 0:52:15.360000::Do you remember this Nate?
0:52:15.920000 - 0:52:16.800000::Yeah, I was laughing.
0:52:17.480000 - 0:52:23.480000::And then she, and I think she must have got a, because she was asking like, I'm okay.
0:52:23.480000 - 0:52:25::And her friends are like, I think so.
0:52:25.240000 - 0:52:28.680000::But you can see that they're like so fucking scared because there's blood coming out
0:52:28.680000 - 0:52:30.280000::of her eyeballs. Good.
0:52:30.280000 - 0:52:31.280000::God.
0:52:31.280000 - 0:52:32.280000::That was.
0:52:33.120000 - 0:52:38.040000::I'll be willing to bet a large sum of money that I've hit my head about 100 times more
0:52:38.040000 - 0:52:40.800000::violently than any of y'all to in your lives combined.
0:52:40.800000 - 0:52:45.400000::Would you smank that thing on just growing up riding on that God damn skateboard.
0:52:45.400000 - 0:52:48.160000::I have had the craziest busted head injuries.
0:52:48.520000 - 0:52:54.040000::You know, in the cartoon when it goes like this boy, I had a whole big
0:52:54.040000 - 0:52:55.520000::old one coming out my forehead.
0:52:55.800000 - 0:52:59.280000::Can I ask what is in that in those swellings?
0:52:59.280000 - 0:53:00.200000::Is it just blood?
0:53:00.720000 - 0:53:01.480000::I have no idea.
0:53:01.480000 - 0:53:03.160000::I'm not squishy.
0:53:04.160000 - 0:53:05.160000::So what the hell is it?
0:53:05.160000 - 0:53:06.480000::Is it, is it, it's not muscle?
0:53:06.520000 - 0:53:09::Not like the muscles are reconfiguring to be a woman.
0:53:09.320000 - 0:53:12.640000::Nobody tells us the purpose and leave it there for good.
0:53:13.640000 - 0:53:15.760000::Cosmetically, I don't know.
0:53:15.760000 - 0:53:15.960000::I don't know.
0:53:15.960000 - 0:53:16.760000::I'm doing them.
0:53:16.760000 - 0:53:18.600000::Did you guys see this girl at Best Buy?
0:53:18.600000 - 0:53:20.840000::That got the display thing.
0:53:21.400000 - 0:53:26.400000::She was working at the cashier and like the display, whatever background behind her
0:53:26.600000 - 0:53:27.400000::came crashing down.
0:53:27.400000 - 0:53:27.800000::Oh, no.
0:53:27.800000 - 0:53:31.600000::Like hit her in the neck and you see her going like holding her head and she's still standing
0:53:31.600000 - 0:53:32.600000::up.
0:53:32.600000 - 0:53:36.800000::But in the guy that other employees rush over to like fix the display and don't check
0:53:36.800000 - 0:53:37.800000::on her.
0:53:37.800000 - 0:53:41.680000::But as it turns out, she had like some arteries severed in her,
0:53:42.440000 - 0:53:46.200000::in her neck and it gave her like multiple strokes and she's like,
0:53:46.200000 - 0:53:47.600000::we're covering edges now, we're covering.
0:53:48.720000 - 0:53:50.040000::But that's how love man.
0:53:50.040000 - 0:53:50.720000::I didn't see that.
0:53:50.720000 - 0:53:51.720000::What the fuck?
0:53:51.960000 - 0:53:52.520000::What do you mean?
0:53:52.520000 - 0:53:53.880000::Did we hear about what the fuck?
0:53:54.520000 - 0:53:56.320000::You didn't see this TikTok that I watched last night.
0:53:56.320000 - 0:53:57.320000::I didn't see that.
0:53:58.200000 - 0:53:58.720000::What are you?
0:53:58.720000 - 0:53:59.520000::What is your?
0:53:59.760000 - 0:54:00.360000::No, I don't know.
0:54:00.360000 - 0:54:01.480000::Why did I bring that up?
0:54:01.480000 - 0:54:03.080000::Oh, because we are this.
0:54:03.080000 - 0:54:06.280000::We are all inside of our own social media bubbles.
0:54:06.280000 - 0:54:09.680000::Like this is just the news that everybody knows about.
0:54:09.680000 - 0:54:15.280000::But you are in your own echo chamber area and every video that you watch is
0:54:15.280000 - 0:54:18.080000::telling you to keep on believing in the thing that you're believing.
0:54:18.080000 - 0:54:23.240000::And I think that both of everyone on this podcast is just out of their minds
0:54:23.240000 - 0:54:28.240000::on in and has no actual clue what's going on in the world.
0:54:28.240000 - 0:54:32.240000::We've been so tortured by these news cycles in social media.
0:54:32.240000 - 0:54:33::Yeah.
0:54:33 - 0:54:35.560000::I'm saying, which is where a lot of people are getting their news from these days,
0:54:35.560000 - 0:54:36.560000::which I don't agree with.
0:54:36.560000 - 0:54:40.480000::I think it should be the old fashioned channel for nine p.m. style news.
0:54:40.480000 - 0:54:41.240000::Yeah.
0:54:41.240000 - 0:54:45.200000::With the with the gregally, you know, alcoholic anchor.
0:54:45.200000 - 0:54:47.520000::Those people were part of my family.
0:54:47.520000 - 0:54:50.960000::We would watch that shit every night until I asked to stop watching it
0:54:50.960000 - 0:54:53.160000::because it was scaring me at about a date.
0:54:53.720000 - 0:54:55.760000::I feel about Fantasia Burino.
0:54:56.400000 - 0:54:57.960000::Who's Fantasia Burino?
0:54:58.680000 - 0:54:59.880000::Fantasia Burinos.

0:55:00 - 0:55:06.820000::Jay Hudson. Oh, American Idol. Yeah. Yeah. We've been
0:55:06.820000 - 0:55:11.920000::stuttered. Man. All right. Let's let's say what gave our asses joy this week,
0:55:11.920000 - 0:55:15.680000::because as you all know, we've been down, but we're coming back.
0:55:15.680000 - 0:55:19.920000::Did not. The news is once again proven that the best lack all conviction and
0:55:19.920000 - 0:55:24.640000::the worst speak with passion, intensity. Say it from the back. So yeah,
0:55:24.640000 - 0:55:33.120000::what gave us joy? Well, here I'll get it going. Please. What gave me joy? We were
0:55:33.120000 - 0:55:37.040000::out there on the picket line. I'll say it. Fuck it. I'm not afraid to admit it.
0:55:38 - 0:55:41.200000::And we were out there doing this thing. We're out there from four in the
0:55:41.200000 - 0:55:44.160000::mornings. And people out there from two in the morning trying to shut down this
0:55:44.160000 - 0:55:49.600000::whatever ghost busters production. Let them know. We're disrupting here.
0:55:49.600000 - 0:55:53.200000::And so we felt like such fools, because I think we'd thought we'd kind of messed
0:55:53.200000 - 0:55:58.240000::up, but we just kept on keeping on and talking to all the people, crew, and
0:55:58.240000 - 0:56:00.800000::extras. And they're also nice. And then all of a sudden out of the blue, they
0:56:00.800000 - 0:56:05.920000::said, you know what? We're going to shut down for the rest of the day. And that
0:56:05.920000 - 0:56:13.600000::felt like. Respect. You got to respect a little bit of joy was injected
0:56:13.600000 - 0:56:17.760000::into my brain after that. Then I went home and got a turkey sandwich with
0:56:17.760000 - 0:56:23.200000::thousand island dressing. And then I fell asleep at 7 p.m.
0:56:25.280000 - 0:56:31.440000::That's excellent. Okay. What gave my eyes joy? Well, let's see. Oh, I've been playing
0:56:31.440000 - 0:56:35.280000::chivalry too, which you guys haven't been wanting to play with my eyes. I'm playing. I'm getting
0:56:35.280000 - 0:56:41.040000::better than you can imagine with the axe with the broad sword with the fucking foult she on sword.
0:56:41.040000 - 0:56:47.520000::And that game is hard. It's a basically for everybody listening to medieval multiplayer battle.
0:56:47.520000 - 0:56:53.120000::Okay. And it's hard and you're slicing people and people slicing you. And I've been playing
0:56:53.120000 - 0:56:57.360000::that and just getting some wild enjoyment out of it. And last night I'll tell you what,
0:56:57.360000 - 0:57:04.320000::I made some fried rice and that shit was delicious. And I played chivalry too. I hate my rice and
0:57:04.320000 - 0:57:09.200000::just had a little night. And so, you know, you got to take the small wins. You have to take the small
0:57:09.200000 - 0:57:14.560000::wins. And trust me, other stuff is cooking that's going to bring me more joy than anybody's ever
0:57:14.560000 - 0:57:21.280000::felt, but now it's a small win. Small and a small win looks mighty big in the mirror. You know what I
0:57:21.280000 - 0:57:26.480000::mean? That's right. Small wins full-sized wins looking at itself in the mirror. Right. Right.
0:57:26.480000 - 0:57:31.280000::Nate, we're all wondering, man. Well, let's see here. I went on probably a,
0:57:33.200000 - 0:57:38.800000::I went about a 35 minute run, which is like kind of my record right now with my,
0:57:38.800000 - 0:57:44.480000::my back's all fucked up. And I'm slowly getting back into running shape. But I can run so slowly.
0:57:44.560000 - 0:57:51.840000::Like I'm afraid to like go really fast. And I've stopped going to physical therapy because I'm like,
0:57:51.840000 - 0:57:58.160000::I think I don't really need to do this, which might, I hope it's not a mistake. But I've just been
0:57:58.160000 - 0:58:07.280000::slowly increasing my, my running and, and I'm like, okay, I think I might be like starting to just
0:58:07.280000 - 0:58:14.320000::come back. Please God, can I just go out for a fucking run? Because should we all do this body shot,
0:58:14.320000 - 0:58:19.360000::compare, we're changing our bodies by Christmas. It's the Christmas challenge. Oh shit. And we'll,
0:58:19.360000 - 0:58:24.480000::we'll show our shirtless bodies on Patreon. And then the comparison and kind of a little bit of
0:58:24.480000 - 0:58:29.280000::the journey if you want to fall along it. And if you want to see their sound off. We are posting so
0:58:29.280000 - 0:58:33.200000::many pictures of our bodies on Patreon. I don't think a lot of people know this. They think it's
0:58:33.200000 - 0:58:39.680000::just bonus episodes. But no, no, no. Every day it's just a new type of body. Oh, it's 4 p.m. What am I

0:58:59.520000 - 0:59:05.040000::the negative. And that's what they want us to. That's what the military industrial American
0:59:05.040000 - 0:59:10.720000::complex wants us to keep going further and further in the spiral of depression and sadness
0:59:10.720000 - 0:59:15.760000::and anxiety. But guess what? You can claw your way out of it. And that's what we're doing right now.
0:59:15.760000 - 0:59:19.040000::And what are you going to do? You're going to focus on the positive. You're going to focus on
