0:00:10.040000 - 0:00:11.840000::If we did two months on birth,

0:00:15.760000 - 0:00:18.680000::we would get more listeners and we would blow the fuck up that
0:00:18.680000 - 0:00:19.760000::if we did a birth thing.
0:00:19.760000 - 0:00:20.920000::Oh, it did.

0:00:43.960000 - 0:00:47.800000::And what is the topic of today's podcast, guys?
0:00:47.800000 - 0:00:51.600000::It's of a crime most foul, OK?
0:00:51.600000 - 0:00:53.880000::This is about a crime that is most foul.
0:00:53.880000 - 0:00:56.040000::A sin, a mortal sin.
0:00:56.040000 - 0:00:59.320000::Something you'd never want to happen to you or loved one.
0:00:59.320000 - 0:01:01.160000::Murder.
0:01:01.160000 - 0:01:02.120000::Murder.
0:01:02.120000 - 0:01:04.200000::I think this is going to be a podcast that
0:01:04.200000 - 0:01:07.600000::will be played in a court of law one day when one of us
0:01:07.600000 - 0:01:09.920000::comes out as like some crazy murderer.
0:01:09.920000 - 0:01:10.440000::Yeah.
0:01:10.440000 - 0:01:12.880000::They're going to go back and listen to our kind of thoughts
0:01:12.880000 - 0:01:15.280000::on just the topic of murder.
0:01:15.280000 - 0:01:17.640000::And so I just want to say just right now
0:01:17.640000 - 0:01:18.640000::that I'm against it.
0:01:18.640000 - 0:01:19.880000::Never would do it ever.
0:01:19.880000 - 0:01:21.840000::I've been framed.
0:01:21.840000 - 0:01:23.720000::A lot of people are against me in the government
0:01:23.720000 - 0:01:25.080000::and in my personal life.
0:01:25.080000 - 0:01:27.280000::And I would never commit any sort of crime like that
0:01:27.280000 - 0:01:28.280000::in my fucking life.
0:01:28.280000 - 0:01:31.560000::Because I value life more than maybe most people
0:01:31.560000 - 0:01:33.720000::on this fucking planet.
0:01:33.720000 - 0:01:35.880000::I'm against murder, except for if you're
0:01:35.880000 - 0:01:39.640000::trying to preserve a timeline where everything works out.
0:01:39.640000 - 0:01:41.720000::So if you had to go back in time and murder someone that
0:01:41.720000 - 0:01:43.600000::didn't even deserve it, but they had to fucking die
0:01:43.600000 - 0:01:46.480000::to save the rest of everybody, I would be the operator
0:01:46.480000 - 0:01:48.680000::to go do that for the organization.
0:01:48.680000 - 0:01:49.280000::OK?
0:01:49.280000 - 0:01:51.600000::And if I had to end myself to save everybody,
0:01:51.600000 - 0:01:53.640000::I would do that in a heartbeat.
0:01:53.720000 - 0:01:54.880000::But that's not murder.
0:01:54.880000 - 0:01:57.480000::That is the.
0:01:57.480000 - 0:01:58.440000::That's murder.
0:01:58.440000 - 0:01:59.320000::Yeah.
0:01:59.320000 - 0:02:00.720000::That's martyrdom.
0:02:00.720000 - 0:02:01.720000::Marry.
0:02:01.720000 - 0:02:04.120000::My stance on murder.
0:02:04.120000 - 0:02:07.640000::Listen, a lot of people come up to me and they say,
0:02:07.640000 - 0:02:12.400000::Jack, it looks like your mustache is blonde.
0:02:12.400000 - 0:02:13.320000::Why is that?
0:02:13.320000 - 0:02:16::Why is your mustache blonde?
0:02:16 - 0:02:18.960000::I say, you want to know how I got these blond?
0:02:18.960000 - 0:02:23.440000::I had to kill a lot of people to get these.
0:02:23.520000 - 0:02:27.240000::You do look like kind of like a Gulf War kind of like
0:02:27.240000 - 0:02:32.160000::poisoned by the gas and quate and you're like glasses
0:02:32.160000 - 0:02:33.880000::look a little bit darker shade.
0:02:33.880000 - 0:02:37.480000::And the mustache looks like it's going into a good tea.
0:02:37.480000 - 0:02:39.040000::And you got some Miller.
0:02:39.040000 - 0:02:40.680000::You look like you want A-Wall.
0:02:40.680000 - 0:02:42.800000::I don't even know what that stands for with that means.
0:02:42.800000 - 0:02:44.400000::But you look like you did that.
0:02:44.400000 - 0:02:46.200000::Yeah, you definitely look like A-Wall.
0:02:46.200000 - 0:02:48.560000::I did go A-Wall when I had to go to special needs camp
0:02:48.560000 - 0:02:51.200000::that one summer.
0:02:51.200000 - 0:02:53.280000::Have I told that on here?
0:02:53.280000 - 0:02:54.480000::I think so.
0:02:54.480000 - 0:02:56.240000::He told it to me, but not maybe not to.
0:02:56.240000 - 0:02:57.240000::Let's move on.
0:02:57.240000 - 0:02:58.080000::Oh, you know what?
0:02:58.080000 - 0:02:59.440000::If you haven't heard it then.
0:02:59.440000 - 0:03:01.440000::Then hitch a cup.
0:03:01.440000 - 0:03:03.360000::Listen to a long-ass voice message.
0:03:03.360000 - 0:03:04.120000::Yeah.
0:03:04.120000 - 0:03:04.920000::So what the hell?
0:03:04.920000 - 0:03:06.680000::Murder happened early on.
0:03:06.680000 - 0:03:08.160000::Who, what was the first murder?
0:03:08.160000 - 0:03:11.240000::I guess, Kane murdered Abel or when it was one of the other
0:03:11.240000 - 0:03:13::ways around, member of the brothers.
0:03:13 - 0:03:13.840000::Well, Adam's murder.
0:03:13.840000 - 0:03:15.880000::All the way back in biblical times.
0:03:15.880000 - 0:03:18.880000::God fucking murdered it when he made this fucking planet.
0:03:18.880000 - 0:03:19.960000::Oh, he murdered that.
0:03:19.960000 - 0:03:20.960000::He did murder that.
0:03:20.960000 - 0:03:22.440000::But it's a place amazing.
0:03:22.440000 - 0:03:23.280000::But in a good way.
0:03:23.280000 - 0:03:26.800000::But back to Kane and Abel, what the hell was that about?
0:03:26.800000 - 0:03:27.640000::Okay.
0:03:27.640000 - 0:03:30.560000::He wanted one of them wanted some fruit.
0:03:30.560000 - 0:03:31.800000::Or maybe it was a farmer.
0:03:31.800000 - 0:03:33.720000::No, no, no, no, listen to me.
0:03:33.720000 - 0:03:34.720000::Listen to me.
0:03:34.720000 - 0:03:37.080000::This is the story of Kane and Abel.
0:03:37.080000 - 0:03:40.520000::Two brothers who were born in a similar region.
0:03:40.520000 - 0:03:42.200000::Are they were like their brothers?
0:03:42.200000 - 0:03:43.480000::And they were.
0:03:43.480000 - 0:03:47.800000::They're one of the first like six people.
0:03:47.800000 - 0:03:49.720000::I don't know.
0:03:49.720000 - 0:03:50.560000::I don't know how much.
0:03:50.560000 - 0:03:51.400000::I wasn't there.
0:03:51.400000 - 0:03:57.800000::So one of them basically is fucking lying.
0:03:57.800000 - 0:04:01.480000::Lazy as fuck sitting around, smoking the bonk all day, eating
0:04:01.480000 - 0:04:04.120000::rich bits, eating cheese whiz, and they're fucking TikTok
0:04:04.120000 - 0:04:07.160000::famous, and they're going on Ellen and they're back again
0:04:07.160000 - 0:04:09.680000::with the white vans, what not right?
0:04:09.680000 - 0:04:10.920000::Then you've got the other one.
0:04:10.920000 - 0:04:13.680000::I'm not sure which one, either Kane or Abel.
0:04:13.680000 - 0:04:17.720000::And this other one is out here in the gym every day.
0:04:17.720000 - 0:04:19.640000::Fucking looks like shit.
0:04:19.640000 - 0:04:24.840000::Even though they're pressing 650 bench, 1,000 reps,
0:04:24.840000 - 0:04:29.680000::tricep extensions, 600, whatever, 600, 6 miles a day,
0:04:29.680000 - 0:04:32.200000::they're studying every book in the world.
0:04:32.200000 - 0:04:35.400000::And then when they go to apply for a job at the fucking peanut
0:04:35.400000 - 0:04:38.960000::gallery, they kick them in the nuts and tell them to go eat
0:04:38.960000 - 0:04:39.720000::shit.
0:04:39.720000 - 0:04:44.680000::And they think, and how come my fucking brother is fucking
0:04:44.680000 - 0:04:48::TikTok famous and they don't do anything.
0:04:48 - 0:04:50.760000::And I'm fucking busted my fucking ass.
0:04:50.760000 - 0:04:54.360000::And I can't get a grasshopper to kiss me on my fucking mouth
0:04:54.360000 - 0:04:56.360000::because I'm so ugly.
0:04:56.360000 - 0:04:58.040000::And so what does he do?
0:04:58.040000 - 0:05:00.280000::Instead of grappling with his eating,

0:05:00 - 0:05:07.460000::go and and paying attention to God and what God wants him to do. He takes a big
0:05:07.460000 - 0:05:11.180000::fucking rock and drops it like it's hot right on his brother's dome on the
0:05:11.180000 - 0:05:16.500000::coconut. It cracks that shit open and then you crack that open. Is that close? Is
0:05:16.500000 - 0:05:21.220000::that pretty close? It definitely was born out of jealousy and it definitely was a
0:05:21.220000 - 0:05:26.140000::rock. They are telling me this when I'm five years old I'm learning about you
0:05:26.140000 - 0:05:30.820000::can bash someone with a rock and end them. They're doing that in Bible school.
0:05:30.820000 - 0:05:36.340000::Okay, but that's how poison is jealous is it can cause murder? I almost cracked
0:05:36.340000 - 0:05:40.420000::my own. I almost can't enabled myself when I was a kid because I was trying to
0:05:40.420000 - 0:05:47.300000::break up big ass rock about the size of a toaster and so I got a hammer and
0:05:47.300000 - 0:05:51.460000::on the back swing the fucking fork end of the hammer cracked my head open in the
0:05:51.460000 - 0:05:57.780000::back. Oh my fucking oh no. That is a mafia killing me. I'm so
0:05:57.780000 - 0:06:04.700000::shut. I'm so afraid to have kid like when I was a kid these children want to end
0:06:04.700000 - 0:06:07.900000::their lives. I think they want to return to the ether from when they can't win
0:06:07.900000 - 0:06:11.780000::they came they haven't an inkling that it's better before and after life on
0:06:11.780000 - 0:06:17.780000::earth. But I I used to put rocks in a vice and just crack them shit. A vice
0:06:17.780000 - 0:06:23.500000::till it exploded you know a vice you're like you've ever seen a vice you know
0:06:23.500000 - 0:06:29.380000::the vices no no vise you like it's like a little metal thing that has two like
0:06:29.380000 - 0:06:32.660000::sides that come in and you can you put pressure on it and you get it tighter
0:06:32.660000 - 0:06:36.740000::and tighter until it like squeezes something like for putting pieces of wood
0:06:36.740000 - 0:06:43.700000::together. Yeah it's usually to hold some wood or something but I was fuck I
0:06:43.700000 - 0:06:50.300000::hated rocks. No I think I saw I went to like one of those country rural stores
0:06:50.300000 - 0:06:54.060000::that had geodes and I was like oh shit all rocks have this inside and so I
0:06:54.060000 - 0:06:57.220000::would like go find rocks in the backyard and just put that shit in there and
0:06:57.220000 - 0:07:02.100000::explode them. But it was one rock trapping away from being all blind my whole life
0:07:02.100000 - 0:07:05.340000::I swear to God my parents have come in and I'm trying to crush the rock
0:07:05.340000 - 0:07:09.260000::explode it and they're like stop stop stop I crush it anyways explode it
0:07:09.260000 - 0:07:13.460000::into a million pieces never find a good one. Listen this is I feel
0:07:13.460000 - 0:07:19.740000::this is what I feel blessed about my parents for is they did not seemingly
0:07:19.740000 - 0:07:23.980000::give a single fuck about whether we lived or died in the best way. There was they
0:07:23.980000 - 0:07:27.900000::were hardly ever home they didn't ever tell us no shit no nothing everyone's
0:07:27.900000 - 0:07:32.180000::making dinner for themselves every night you fucking go out at fucking get home
0:07:32.180000 - 0:07:36.380000::at four in the morning has 12 year old who cares and they kind of let me
0:07:36.380000 - 0:07:40.500000::live or die and they let me make my mistakes and when the DC sniper came
0:07:40.500000 - 0:07:44.660000::around everybody else's parents were freaking out my parents were like yeah
0:07:44.660000 - 0:07:48.660000::go do it everyone you want to go outside you want to go skateboard whatever and I
0:07:48.660000 - 0:07:55.860000::feel like that gave me a calmness in a sense of if God wants to take me so
0:07:55.860000 - 0:08:00.180000::be it will yeah will and that's not the Reaper the Reaper and that's why I have
0:08:00.180000 - 0:08:07.460000::zero anxiety that's a good thing that is a that not well I listen to this episode

0:10:04.400000 - 0:10:05.400000::What did you do?
0:10:05.400000 - 0:10:06.240000::I used to get in vans.
0:10:06.240000 - 0:10:07.040000::Oh, go ahead.
0:10:07.040000 - 0:10:10.120000::Oh, I'm taking this in a slightly different direction.
0:10:10.120000 - 0:10:13.400000::But I hopped in a van a couple of nights ago in an Uber.
0:10:13.400000 - 0:10:14.120000::And guess what?
0:10:14.120000 - 0:10:17.120000::The Uber driver was fucking blasting.
0:10:17.120000 - 0:10:20::So it's song about him at a volume.
0:10:20 - 0:10:23.080000::And he's talking about children and their nature
0:10:23.080000 - 0:10:25.120000::and how they need to be disciplined.
0:10:25.120000 - 0:10:26.320000::And he was gotten along.
0:10:26.320000 - 0:10:27.200000::He was nodding along.
0:10:27.200000 - 0:10:29.160000::And I was like, dappin' him out like, yep,
0:10:29.160000 - 0:10:30.160000::that's a brother.
0:10:30.160000 - 0:10:33.240000::Jordan Peterson sucks so much that he made,
0:10:33.240000 - 0:10:37.920000::like I hate generalizations, but he makes me hate all Canadians.
0:10:37.920000 - 0:10:40.040000::Just because you know what I'm saying?
0:10:40.040000 - 0:10:44.240000::Like he's like, uh, listen, I was in the Uber
0:10:44.240000 - 0:10:46.360000::with another guy with Daniel.
0:10:46.360000 - 0:10:47.360000::And we're talking.
0:10:47.360000 - 0:10:49.480000::And Daniel's kind of going off on Jordan Peterson.
0:10:49.480000 - 0:10:50.600000::And I'm kind of going off.
0:10:50.600000 - 0:10:51.720000::But then I felt bad.
0:10:51.720000 - 0:10:54::Here's where my pupil pleasing came in.
0:10:54 - 0:10:57.640000::I felt bad for this young maybe 23-year-old guy that's maybe
0:10:57.640000 - 0:10:59.680000::listening, trying to expand his mind for the first time
0:10:59.680000 - 0:11:01.720000::and just stumbled upon Jordan Peterson.
0:11:01.720000 - 0:11:05.360000::And I was like, yeah, you know, he is, does seem smart.
0:11:05.360000 - 0:11:07.600000::Like he does seem like he has good at, you know,
0:11:07.600000 - 0:11:09.120000::I was like, just saying this to Daniel,
0:11:09.120000 - 0:11:10.960000::but trying to have the other guy over here
0:11:10.960000 - 0:11:13.880000::that maybe he should be a little more critical about his,
0:11:13.880000 - 0:11:16.320000::what ideologies he's soaking in.
0:11:16.320000 - 0:11:19.400000::But I was trying to like also not make him feel like an idiot.
0:11:19.400000 - 0:11:21.880000::So is that my people pleasing too hard, guys?
0:11:21.880000 - 0:11:23.640000::Do I need to stop people pleasing now?
0:11:23.640000 - 0:11:25.840000::No, that's not even people pleasing, man.
0:11:25.840000 - 0:11:29.480000::That's, you know, just teasing.
0:11:29.480000 - 0:11:33.880000::I don't, my brain molecules aren't firing at 100% today.
0:11:33.880000 - 0:11:36.760000::But it sounds like you are inviting somebody
0:11:36.760000 - 0:11:38.360000::to engage with you.
0:11:38.360000 - 0:11:39.200000::Yes.
0:11:39.200000 - 0:11:41.240000::And if they're brave enough, they could step into the ring.
0:11:41.240000 - 0:11:43.480000::But not everybody's ready for that rodeo.
0:11:43.480000 - 0:11:44.480000::Because you buck, man.
0:11:44.480000 - 0:11:45.480000::You're the mental buck.
0:11:45.480000 - 0:11:46::Buck.
0:11:46 - 0:11:46.840000::Buck.
0:11:46.840000 - 0:11:49.080000::Intensely, man.
0:11:49.080000 - 0:11:51.080000::You know, the mental rodeo go crazy on this.
0:11:51.080000 - 0:11:53.360000::It's a hard, it's a fine line between,
0:11:53.360000 - 0:11:55.280000::because I'm a people pleaser as well.
0:11:55.280000 - 0:12:00::And I like, I think it is one of my worst qualities.
0:12:00 - 0:12:05::And there's something I want to, to like not be so badly.
0:12:05 - 0:12:09.800000::But I can't help but please everybody, everybody around me.
0:12:09.800000 - 0:12:11.240000::I want everyone to like me.
0:12:11.240000 - 0:12:12.280000::I want the whole badly.
0:12:12.280000 - 0:12:14.600000::I want the hotel receptionist to like me so,
0:12:14.600000 - 0:12:16.240000::and to get a charm when I come in,
0:12:16.240000 - 0:12:17.280000::gotta say something nice.
0:12:17.280000 - 0:12:19.640000::Hey, hello, late night, huh?
0:12:19.640000 - 0:12:22.640000::Yo, I want to just lose it on somebody and I'll give a fuck.
0:12:22.640000 - 0:12:23.480000::But I can't.
0:12:23.480000 - 0:12:25.040000::I want to go fucking Larry David's style.
0:12:25.040000 - 0:12:27.720000::That's why I love Kirby Enthesiasm and Seinfeld so much.
0:12:27.720000 - 0:12:30.160000::And I'm like, damn, I wish I could be like that, man.
0:12:30.160000 - 0:12:33.920000::I wish I could be like Larry David and fucking just being so rude.
0:12:33.920000 - 0:12:35.040000::Everyone hates me.
0:12:35.040000 - 0:12:37.400000::Because he's the opposite of a people pleaser.
0:12:37.400000 - 0:12:39.440000::He's a people displeaser.
0:12:39.440000 - 0:12:41.360000::He's a displeaser for that.
0:12:41.360000 - 0:12:43.400000::People love him.
0:12:43.400000 - 0:12:44.160000::Here's the thing.
0:12:44.160000 - 0:12:45.560000::I need to do something where it's like,
0:12:45.560000 - 0:12:48.200000::oh, Eric was actually being really nice today.
0:12:48.200000 - 0:12:49.720000::What the hell is awesome.
0:12:49.720000 - 0:12:50.560000::You know what I mean?
0:12:50.560000 - 0:12:51.840000::Give him a taste of the devil.
0:12:51.840000 - 0:12:54.400000::I'm just giving little droplets of being nice.
0:12:54.400000 - 0:12:58.880000::And then they unfortunately I'm one of the best people alive.
0:12:58.880000 - 0:13:00.760000::Well, let's try it right now.
0:13:00.760000 - 0:13:01.640000::Let's try it.
0:13:01.640000 - 0:13:04.600000::OK, so how would that go if we were not all people pleasers?
0:13:04.600000 - 0:13:05.560000::How would we go?
0:13:05.560000 - 0:13:07.960000::This podcast.
0:13:07.960000 - 0:13:08.920000::No, this podcast.
0:13:08.920000 - 0:13:12.320000::So it would probably go something like this.
0:13:12.320000 - 0:13:15.240000::Can we could do fucking five minutes today?
0:13:15.240000 - 0:13:16.560000::I'm fucking busy.
0:13:16.560000 - 0:13:19.960000::I don't feel like it.
0:13:19.960000 - 0:13:21.040000::Sure, man.
0:13:21.040000 - 0:13:21.640000::Oh, fuck.

0:13:24.120000 - 0:13:27.920000::Whatever you need, man, like, yo, you want money?
0:13:27.920000 - 0:13:29.960000::Yeah, no, that's tough.
0:13:29.960000 - 0:13:35.160000::Dude, if I was a Uber driver, being a Uber driver in like a virtue-signal-y way,
0:13:35.160000 - 0:13:37.720000::like if you were driving for Uber and you're playing Jordan Peterson
0:13:37.720000 - 0:13:40.040000::and just shaking your head, no, the whole time.
0:13:40.040000 - 0:13:41.720000::Yeah, I hate this.

0:13:44.440000 - 0:13:46::Just shaking your head.
0:13:46 - 0:13:48.120000::That would make me laugh if I saw that.
0:13:48.120000 - 0:13:49.120000::Oh my god.

0:21:59.680000 - 0:22:00.680000::I remember.
0:22:00.680000 - 0:22:02.680000::I had an awesome dream last night.

0:22:18.680000 - 0:22:21.680000::I can't remember red flags.
0:22:21.680000 - 0:22:23.680000::We were talking about red flags.
0:22:24.680000 - 0:22:26.680000::We were talking about avocado toast.
0:22:26.680000 - 0:22:29.680000::We were talking about that in most podcasts.
0:22:29.680000 - 0:22:32.680000::We were talking about Australian restaurants.
0:22:32.680000 - 0:22:36.680000::I don't know, man.
0:22:36.680000 - 0:22:37.680000::I don't remember.
0:22:37.680000 - 0:22:39.680000::Why do I have to say this?
0:22:39.680000 - 0:22:40.680000::Wait a minute.
0:22:40.680000 - 0:22:41.680000::Why is this so fucked up?
0:22:41.680000 - 0:22:42.680000::We just recorded this.
0:22:42.680000 - 0:22:43.680000::I know.
0:22:43.680000 - 0:22:44.680000::Okay.
0:22:44.680000 - 0:22:45.680000::So what can I remember?
0:22:45.680000 - 0:22:48.680000::I'm sure we talked about something like that.
0:22:48.680000 - 0:22:51.680000::But I was talking to one of our girlfriends.
0:22:51.680000 - 0:22:52.680000::I won't say which one.
0:22:52.680000 - 0:22:56.680000::And she was telling me that the reason that there's so many Australian restaurants
0:22:56.680000 - 0:23:00.680000::is that 9-11 caused avocado toast.
0:23:00.680000 - 0:23:03.680000::Or Jesus Christ.
0:23:03.680000 - 0:23:04.680000::I can explain.
0:23:04.680000 - 0:23:05.680000::I'm so sorry guys.
0:23:05.680000 - 0:23:06.680000::I'm so sorry.
0:23:06.680000 - 0:23:07.680000::I know what it's like.
0:23:07.680000 - 0:23:11.680000::You're having a brain accident right now that we don't know about.
0:23:11.680000 - 0:23:13.680000::I know what it's like to bring around me.
0:23:13.680000 - 0:23:15.680000::And I appreciate the patience.
0:23:15.680000 - 0:23:18.680000::Everybody I fucking appreciate it so much.
0:23:18.680000 - 0:23:19.680000::Okay.
0:23:19.680000 - 0:23:22.680000::Why are there so many Australian restaurants in New York?
0:23:22.680000 - 0:23:30.680000::Avocado toast is an Australian dish was brought to the United States.
0:23:30.680000 - 0:23:36.680000::And the reason that Australians brought it here so successfully is that after we invaded the Middle East,
0:23:36.680000 - 0:23:43.680000::we could deal with Australian citizens that if they if they joined the military and joined our fight in the Middle East,
0:23:43.680000 - 0:23:49.680000::the Australian military, they can get visas more easily in the US.
0:23:49.680000 - 0:23:56.680000::And though and thus 9-11 was a dark side silver lining,
0:23:56.680000 - 0:23:58.680000::brunch has become fucking amazing.
0:23:58.680000 - 0:24:00.680000::Oh my god.
0:24:00.680000 - 0:24:01.680000::Hold it.
0:24:01.680000 - 0:24:04.680000::So you're saying 9-11 brought about the advent of avocado toast in the United States.
0:24:04.680000 - 0:24:06.680000::Because that's an Australian delicacy.
0:24:06.680000 - 0:24:09.680000::Avocado toast is an Australian thing.
0:24:09.680000 - 0:24:11.680000::That's what one of our girlfriends was telling me.
0:24:11.680000 - 0:24:12.680000::What the hell?
0:24:12.680000 - 0:24:13.680000::That's amazing.
0:24:13.680000 - 0:24:15.680000::Nate, you don't even seem impressed by this.
0:24:15.680000 - 0:24:17.680000::You seem pissed off by this fact.
0:24:17.680000 - 0:24:18.680000::You look pretty though.
0:24:18.680000 - 0:24:20.680000::I don't really care about this shit.
0:24:20.680000 - 0:24:22.680000::That's me not being a peel blazer.
0:24:22.680000 - 0:24:24.680000::Wow.
0:24:24.680000 - 0:24:25.680000::Nate.
0:24:25.680000 - 0:24:26.680000::Oh man.
0:24:26.680000 - 0:24:27.680000::What the fuck's wrong with you?
0:24:27.680000 - 0:24:28.680000::I'm kidding.
0:24:28.680000 - 0:24:29.680000::This is an interesting ass fucking.
0:24:29.680000 - 0:24:31.680000::This is some interesting knowledge right here.
0:24:31.680000 - 0:24:35.680000::Well, what's fun about it is, sorry Nate, were you gonna explain on that?
0:24:35.680000 - 0:24:37.680000::No, I was.
0:24:37.680000 - 0:24:43.880000::You know what I was thinking about is just how millennials, like that's associated with
0:24:43.880000 - 0:24:45.680000::millennials, you know what I'm saying?
0:24:45.680000 - 0:24:46.680000::Right.
0:24:46.680000 - 0:24:47.680000::The avocado toast.
0:24:47.680000 - 0:24:48.680000::Right.
0:24:48.680000 - 0:24:49.680000::It's like a cliche.
0:24:49.680000 - 0:24:50.680000::It's like a double triple cliche.
0:24:50.680000 - 0:24:57.680000::It's like when boomers think of of a millennials, they think of avocado toast.
0:24:57.680000 - 0:25:00.680000::And it's almost like cringing me out to even like,

0:25:00 - 0:25:02.200000::say it or mention it at all.
0:25:02.200000 - 0:25:03.360000::Free Shavaka-do.
0:25:04.400000 - 0:25:05.240000::What's that?
0:25:05.240000 - 0:25:07.800000::One of the most cringiest moments of my life.
0:25:07.800000 - 0:25:08.960000::What is free Shavaka-do?
0:25:08.960000 - 0:25:10.360000::No, not going on.
0:25:10.360000 - 0:25:11.720000::Cringiest moments of my life.
0:25:11.720000 - 0:25:13.120000::Okay, we'll go back to talking about
0:25:13.120000 - 0:25:15.600000::audition in the second city, whatever.
0:25:15.600000 - 0:25:17.280000::I wanted to work for second city so bad
0:25:17.280000 - 0:25:19.080000::went to that catacall audition.
0:25:19.080000 - 0:25:21.800000::And they do this thing where you have to line up
0:25:21.800000 - 0:25:22.840000::with a bunch of people.
0:25:22.840000 - 0:25:24.400000::Some people you know, some people that you don't
0:25:24.400000 - 0:25:26.840000::and you're trying to be funny off the bat, trying to please,
0:25:26.840000 - 0:25:29.280000::these people and you're wearing a,
0:25:29.280000 - 0:25:32.560000::you got a shave face, you're wearing a button down
0:25:32.560000 - 0:25:35.240000::and slacks and check-a-boots, whatever.
0:25:35.240000 - 0:25:36.960000::And they say, all right, everybody step out
0:25:36.960000 - 0:25:39.440000::and say a fun fact about yourself and they're calling on you.
0:25:39.440000 - 0:25:41.720000::And for some reason I was like,
0:25:41.720000 - 0:25:44.400000::it was when avocado toast was fucking popping off
0:25:44.400000 - 0:25:45.800000::and it was like kind of,
0:25:45.800000 - 0:25:47.560000::everybody was like loving the fuck out of it
0:25:47.560000 - 0:25:49.040000::and it wasn't cringy yet.
0:25:49.040000 - 0:25:49.880000::And I stepped out.
0:25:49.880000 - 0:25:52.320000::I think I made avocado toast cringe
0:25:52.320000 - 0:25:53.920000::because I stepped out and I said,

0:27:16.520000 - 0:27:19.840000::Yeah, that is somehow like get a,
0:27:19.840000 - 0:27:23.480000::like kind of a selfie video nominated for an Oscar,
0:27:23.480000 - 0:27:25.640000::and you could like technically,
0:27:25.640000 - 0:27:27.400000::you know, you were the wardrobe,
0:27:27.400000 - 0:27:28.720000::you dressed yourself that day,
0:27:28.720000 - 0:27:30.760000::you're the director of the cinematographer.
0:27:30.760000 - 0:27:35.760000::If you could somehow elevate a selfie type video
0:27:36.640000 - 0:27:41.640000::to Oscar level performance and nomination,
0:27:41.760000 - 0:27:42.760000::that it's a pot,
0:27:42.760000 - 0:27:44.560000::it's the thing is anything's possible,
0:27:44.560000 - 0:27:47.440000::and that's why I love living in this fucking planet,
0:27:47.440000 - 0:27:50.200000::is that something like that seems so outlandish,
0:27:50.320000 - 0:27:53.880000::and so fucking not possible,
0:27:53.880000 - 0:27:55.280000::but the thing is it is possible.
0:27:55.280000 - 0:27:56.120000::It can't happen.
0:27:56.120000 - 0:27:59.880000::And I wanna challenge anyone listening to this
0:27:59.880000 - 0:28:04.080000::to go out there and make your Oscar winning,
0:28:04.080000 - 0:28:05.560000::you know, sweep the,

0:28:10.640000 - 0:28:13.120000::because when people think of like a Oscar winning thing,
0:28:13.120000 - 0:28:15.680000::like I think of Oscar winning performance,
0:28:15.680000 - 0:28:18.120000::let's not forget Leonardo DiCaprio
0:28:18.120000 - 0:28:21.640000::when the Oscar for best silent performance,
0:28:21.640000 - 0:28:22.960000::or he was being quiet in that role.

0:28:25.720000 - 0:28:29::you don't have to put all that effort into your Oscar
0:28:29 - 0:28:31.840000::winning selfie with performance.
0:28:31.840000 - 0:28:34.280000::Go in on that fucking sound design.

0:49:19.360000 - 0:49:21.160000::doing the final deed.
0:49:21.160000 - 0:49:21.660000::All right.

0:54:14.940000 - 0:54:15.940000::Ready?
0:54:16.940000 - 0:54:17.940000::All right.

0:54:18.940000 - 0:54:19.940000::All right.
0:54:19.940000 - 0:54:22.940000::This is the worst ever looked on the podcast.
0:54:22.940000 - 0:54:23.940000::Jesus Christ.
0:54:23.940000 - 0:54:25.940000::You look like the fucking Prince from Shrek.
0:54:25.940000 - 0:54:26.940000::I'm laughing.
0:54:26.940000 - 0:54:27.940000::Okay.
0:54:27.940000 - 0:54:28.940000::Wait, Nate.
0:54:28.940000 - 0:54:29.940000::Stop it again.
0:54:29.940000 - 0:54:30.940000::Huh?
0:54:30.940000 - 0:54:31.940000::Stop it again.
0:54:31.940000 - 0:54:32.940000::Stop?
0:54:32.940000 - 0:54:33.940000::Yeah.
0:54:33.940000 - 0:54:34.940000::Okay.
0:54:34.940000 - 0:54:35.940000::All right.
0:54:35.940000 - 0:54:36.940000::Let's go here.
0:54:36.940000 - 0:54:37.940000::All right.
0:54:37.940000 - 0:54:38.940000::This is your past.
0:54:38.940000 - 0:54:39.940000::The temperance.
0:54:39.940000 - 0:54:40.940000::All right.
0:54:40.940000 - 0:54:41.940000::All right.
0:54:42.940000 - 0:54:43.940000::Let's go here.
0:54:43.940000 - 0:54:44.940000::All right.
0:54:44.940000 - 0:54:45.940000::This is your past.
0:54:45.940000 - 0:54:46.940000::The temperance.
0:54:46.940000 - 0:54:47.940000::Okay.
0:54:47.940000 - 0:54:48.940000::So we got kind of like an angel.
0:54:48.940000 - 0:54:50.940000::This is a mysterious card.
0:54:50.940000 - 0:54:53.940000::I'm a mysterious man.
0:54:53.940000 - 0:54:56.940000::What energies in your life require changing?
0:54:56.940000 - 0:54:59.940000::Who is trying to throw you off balance?

0:55:00 - 0:55:05::While you can go with the flow, please examine what needs to be altered.
0:55:05 - 0:55:08.440000::Don't answer one way or the other just yet.
0:55:08.440000 - 0:55:12.200000::Temperate responses change critics to collaborators.
0:55:12.200000 - 0:55:13.600000::Keep calm.
0:55:13.600000 - 0:55:15.400000::Think before answering.
0:55:15.400000 - 0:55:18.040000::So how do you interpret that, Jack?
0:55:18.040000 - 0:55:24::Well, not your past.
0:55:24 - 0:55:34.440000::The directors who've been DMing me, I'm going to respond a little differently than I had planned on.
0:55:34.440000 - 0:55:35.440000::Okay.
0:55:35.440000 - 0:55:43.600000::Because a lot of people have been DMing me, looking for me to enhance their projects through
0:55:43.600000 - 0:55:48.200000::performance, through writing, I'm kind of a visionary.
0:55:48.200000 - 0:55:53.040000::And I've been seeing that as like, oh, you're trying to exploit me.
0:55:53.040000 - 0:55:58.720000::Let's just say Quentin Tarantino has an email coming to him, which is much more friendlier
0:55:58.720000 - 0:56:03.480000::than I had intended because I have a draft right now, my emails.
0:56:03.480000 - 0:56:05.200000::Treating him like shit.
0:56:05.200000 - 0:56:08.040000::You could be the star of his next film, you know, the movie.
0:56:08.040000 - 0:56:10.560000::Oh, dude, I got the Quentin Tarantino look.
0:56:10.560000 - 0:56:13.440000::Because what people don't understand is, oh, I've been all clean.
0:56:13.440000 - 0:56:16.840000::I was trying to clean up when I was in Chicago, trying to play by the books, right?
0:56:16.840000 - 0:56:18.360000::But guess what?
0:56:18.360000 - 0:56:20.920000::When you don't play by the books, you guys start playing by the bricks.
0:56:20.920000 - 0:56:24.040000::And so I'm growing out my fucking go to to look all scary.
0:56:24.040000 - 0:56:28.360000::I've been telling you you need to grow that out, dude.
0:56:28.360000 - 0:56:30.400000::Well, I'm going to be in a horror film type stuff.
0:56:30.400000 - 0:56:32.560000::Okay, you ready for your president?
0:56:32.560000 - 0:56:35.840000::Yeah, I'm going to try pay attention.
0:56:35.840000 - 0:56:38.120000::The tan of pen, oh, Pentecostals.
0:56:38.120000 - 0:56:39.120000::Pentecostals.
0:56:39.120000 - 0:56:40.440000::It's the Pentecostals, dude.
0:56:40.440000 - 0:56:41.440000::That one's pretty.
0:56:41.440000 - 0:56:42.440000::Be careful with the Pentecostals, guys.
0:56:42.440000 - 0:56:43.440000::Fucking penis.
0:56:43.440000 - 0:56:47.200000::Also, you can interpret this by the image, you know, that's what Jane was telling me,
0:56:47.200000 - 0:56:48.200000::is that.
0:56:48.200000 - 0:56:49.200000::Oh, really?
0:56:49.200000 - 0:56:50.200000::That's telling me that.
0:56:50.200000 - 0:56:51.200000::I'm going to get you.
0:56:51.200000 - 0:56:52.840000::That looks like a bunch of those.
0:56:52.840000 - 0:56:55.960000::What are those like Mexican, um, like dragon balls?
0:56:55.960000 - 0:56:57.800000::Things with the cheese in them.
0:56:57.800000 - 0:56:59.760000::Oh, I don't know what you're talking about.
0:56:59.760000 - 0:57:00.760000::Oh, good.
0:57:00.760000 - 0:57:01.760000::I haven't taken them out.
0:57:01.760000 - 0:57:02.760000::Jason D.
0:57:02.760000 - 0:57:03.760000::Dragon Balls.
0:57:03.760000 - 0:57:04.760000::No, no, no.
0:57:04.760000 - 0:57:05.760000::All right.
0:57:05.760000 - 0:57:08.760000::So go, uh, stupidest people of fucking mind.
0:57:08.760000 - 0:57:09.760000::What is the dumbass?
0:57:09.760000 - 0:57:12.640000::They should call this their messed up.
0:57:12.640000 - 0:57:13.960000::You're going to like this.
0:57:13.960000 - 0:57:17.360000::There is no need to worry about finances right now.
0:57:17.360000 - 0:57:19.640000::Expect the money to show up.
0:57:19.640000 - 0:57:26::Your bank account may get a bump from a promotion or an offer of a better job.
0:57:26 - 0:57:27.880000::You guys are both getting fucking rich.
0:57:27.880000 - 0:57:28.880000::Yeah.
0:57:28.880000 - 0:57:31.200000::Invest for the long term as well.
0:57:31.200000 - 0:57:37.160000::Think about how you can create a stable financial future and keep the prosperity flowing.
0:57:37.160000 - 0:57:38.160000::That's amazing, Jack.
0:57:38.160000 - 0:57:39.160000::Oh, wow.
0:57:39.160000 - 0:57:40.160000::Oh.
0:57:40.160000 - 0:57:41.760000::So I can start spending all recklessly.
0:57:41.760000 - 0:57:42.760000::Thank you.
0:57:42.760000 - 0:57:43.760000::Yes.
0:57:43.760000 - 0:57:44.760000::Yeah.
0:57:44.760000 - 0:57:45.600000::You need to hit the casino right the fuck now.
0:57:45.600000 - 0:57:46.600000::You need to adjust.
0:57:46.600000 - 0:57:48.600000::That's what that says to me.
0:57:48.600000 - 0:57:49.600000::Okay.
0:57:49.600000 - 0:57:51.600000::That's incredible.
0:57:51.600000 - 0:57:52.600000::All right.
0:57:52.600000 - 0:57:59.160000::The future is somebody blindfolded with two swords and it's called no god damn it.
0:57:59.160000 - 0:58:00.160000::Oh, fucking god.
0:58:00.160000 - 0:58:01.160000::Two long swords.
0:58:01.160000 - 0:58:05.400000::No, that's who's going to kill me in some chick.
0:58:05.400000 - 0:58:08.480000::Two of swords, a decision awaits.
0:58:08.480000 - 0:58:13.160000::While you may have an internal debate going on, now is the time to let that ambivalence
0:58:13.160000 - 0:58:15.800000::go and make your choice.
0:58:15.800000 - 0:58:17.160000::Backed with swiftness.
0:58:17.160000 - 0:58:20.520000::Be the one who makes the decision good or bad.
0:58:20.520000 - 0:58:23.760000::It must be made now.
0:58:23.760000 - 0:58:26.280000::Take off the blindfold and fucking choose.
0:58:26.280000 - 0:58:27.480000::It says the F word in it.
0:58:27.480000 - 0:58:30::I don't know how to make that up.
0:58:30 - 0:58:32.840000::So here's the thing.
0:58:32.840000 - 0:58:34.080000::And I'm not exaggerating.
0:58:34.080000 - 0:58:36.360000::I'm not kidding about this.
0:58:36.360000 - 0:58:40.600000::I have nothing on my plate at all right.
0:58:40.600000 - 0:58:44.040000::There's not even a small.
0:58:44.040000 - 0:58:45.360000::This is in for me to make.
0:58:45.360000 - 0:58:49.400000::No, no, listen, I knew what that was about immediately for you brother.
0:58:49.400000 - 0:58:53.400000::In about 10 to 15 years when you go through the body transformation and you get that plastic
0:58:53.400000 - 0:58:56.040000::surgery on a lock which by then is going to be so amazing.
0:58:56.040000 - 0:58:58.160000::You can look like whatever the fuck you want.
0:58:58.160000 - 0:59:03.960000::You are going to be blowing up in movies but not in America but you will be dominating
0:59:03.960000 - 0:59:06.080000::the international markets.
0:59:06.080000 - 0:59:07.800000::And you're going to have a choice man.
0:59:07.800000 - 0:59:10.600000::You have the Chinese market which is very powerful.
0:59:10.600000 - 0:59:13.520000::There's over a billion fucking people that are watching your shit.
0:59:13.520000 - 0:59:14.520000::Okay.
0:59:14.600000 - 0:59:18.400000::They have some crazy laws and you're going to have the India market which is a burgeoning
0:59:18.400000 - 0:59:20.720000::market that's going to explode even more than China.
0:59:20.720000 - 0:59:23.960000::And it's going to be a little less money and a little different lifestyle.
0:59:23.960000 - 0:59:28.240000::But you're going to have to choose between an India fucking box office or a Chinese box
0:59:28.240000 - 0:59:29.240000::office.
0:59:29.240000 - 0:59:30.240000::You can't have both brother.
0:59:30.240000 - 0:59:34::You're going to have to choose which international market you want to dominate with those movies.
0:59:34 - 0:59:35::Okay.
0:59:35 - 0:59:36::Yeah.
0:59:36 - 0:59:37::But it's not going to happen in America man.
0:59:37 - 0:59:39.360000::I'm sorry to say we see it in the cards.
0:59:39.360000 - 0:59:40.360000::There's no Americans.
0:59:40.360000 - 0:59:41.880000::You can tell me.
0:59:41.880000 - 0:59:45.040000::You've been telling me for years Jack you're too fucking ugly.
0:59:45.040000 - 0:59:46.440000::It's not going to work out here.
0:59:46.440000 - 0:59:49.680000::You got to go somewhere where the ugly people are India and China.
0:59:49.680000 - 0:59:50.680000::No man.
0:59:50.680000 - 0:59:51.680000::People always said that about me.
0:59:51.680000 - 0:59:52.680000::I never said that.
0:59:52.680000 - 0:59:53.680000::I think everybody is beautiful.
0:59:53.680000 - 0:59:54.680000::No you taught me well man.
0:59:54.680000 - 0:59:55.680000::You taught me well.
0:59:55.680000 - 0:59:56.680000::Yeah.
0:59:56.680000 - 0:59:59.160000::I don't mean plastic surgery for your face.
0:59:59.160000 - 1:00:00::I mean it for your legs.

1:00:00 - 1:00:05.040000::You can have the most cut legs. Oh, you want me to get half of you? I mean to get a couple of 16 coconuts up in my leg
1:00:06.440000 - 1:00:11.180000::They know hey, they don't have the lower body pop by yet. That's what they're gonna get me. Oh, I'll be spending to that
1:00:11.180000 - 1:00:17.120000::Should the hamstring pop by them calves pop up and I'm gonna choke people out with my legs all wrap on them sideways
1:00:17.120000 - 1:00:21.960000::Like a anaconda and choke them out. Oh my god. No things. I wouldn't like to die that way
1:00:22.720000 - 1:00:28.420000::All right, so wow we just got our fucking futures red we barely talked about murder on this shit, but
1:00:29.020000 - 1:00:34.260000::Listen, we have a true crime spin off coming out. That's gonna be about a hundred dollars a week on patreon
1:00:35.260000 - 1:00:38.620000::And I hope you all watch that when it comes out, but I want to ask you guys this
1:00:39.300000 - 1:00:42.580000::What what gave you guys joy this week?
1:00:44.020000 - 1:00:46.020000::Well, I'll kick it off please
1:00:47.500000 - 1:00:55.580000::So I've been doing sort of a pour over coffee in the morning, but not because I want to it's because my
1:00:55.860000 - 1:00:58.380000::coffee pot broke it shattered
1:00:59.060000 - 1:01:04.520000::I'm sorry and you seem pretty busted up about this and yeah, I was for a while
1:01:04.520000 - 1:01:11.340000::So I was I was using the pour over method and I was like God this is fucking taken forever to do this shit and
1:01:12.260000 - 1:01:18.500000::I finally got a new replacement coffee pot and I just said it and forget it this morning
1:01:18.500000 - 1:01:24.200000::I have I have about 10 minutes of my day, which my day is structured into five minute chunks kind of like
1:01:24.200000 - 1:01:27.880000::Bill Gates and Elon Musk where if I have a five minute chunk back
1:01:29.080000 - 1:01:31.360000::We're gonna see new neighborhood businesses new
1:01:32.200000 - 1:01:37.440000::Merchandise we're gonna the possibilities are if I can get that 10 minutes compound at each day
1:01:37.800000 - 1:01:43.120000::Over the course of a year who knows what I can accomplish this is the most animated. I've seen you all podcast
1:01:44.800000 - 1:01:52::All a year really think about your five minute chunks. I'd eat something called a five minute chunk if I could the five minute chunk in the microwave
1:01:52.720000 - 1:01:59.620000::So so you got five minutes back. Oh, fuck that's a nice relationship. I'm yeah, it's gonna change a lot and
1:01:59.800000 - 1:02:01.800000::Get up and then I'm excited and
1:02:02.200000 - 1:02:05.120000::And by the way, can I say one of the funniest things in the world?
1:02:05.120000 - 1:02:11.120000::I'm just gonna burn this idea. I've had this idea for a long time. I will never make it but yeah
1:02:11.400000 - 1:02:18.040000::It's just really just made me think of it just because we're talking about coffee pots. I think a hilarious sort of
1:02:18.040000 - 1:02:23.800000::I don't know if this is a whatever your sketch or something like that but a
