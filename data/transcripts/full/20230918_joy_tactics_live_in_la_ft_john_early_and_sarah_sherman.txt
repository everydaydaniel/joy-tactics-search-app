0:03:36.960000 - 0:03:37.960000::A little bit smaller.

0:03:43.960000 - 0:03:45.280000::You know, the Romans were from there.
0:03:45.280000 - 0:03:49.560000::And do we got any Greek people in the house tonight?
0:03:49.560000 - 0:03:50.560000::Good.
0:03:51.560000 - 0:03:52.560000::Good.
0:03:53.480000 - 0:03:54.320000::Good.
0:03:54.320000 - 0:03:55.520000::You didn't show up.
0:03:55.520000 - 0:03:58.920000::I looked like the message got around LA.
0:03:58.920000 - 0:04:00.960000::Looks like it got around.
0:04:00.960000 - 0:04:01.960000::Good.
0:04:01.960000 - 0:04:05.720000::I fucking hate Greek people, dude.
0:04:05.720000 - 0:04:07.480000::Are you fucking serious, man?
0:04:07.480000 - 0:04:10.440000::The worst fucking people on the planet, dude.
0:04:10.440000 - 0:04:12.160000::And let me make this clear.
0:04:12.160000 - 0:04:13::You guys know this.
0:04:13 - 0:04:15.160000::I'm probably the least racist person in this room.
0:04:15.160000 - 0:04:16::Really?
0:04:16 - 0:04:16.840000::I'm not.
0:04:16.840000 - 0:04:19.480000::I'm not a racist fucking person in this room.
0:04:19.480000 - 0:04:25.240000::In fact, I think that racism has no place in our society whatsoever.
0:04:25.240000 - 0:04:30.320000::That it's a tactic used by the elites to divide us so that we never know how powerful
0:04:30.320000 - 0:04:33.080000::we are when we are together.
0:04:33.080000 - 0:04:34.080000::All right.
0:04:34.080000 - 0:04:35.400000::Give it up for me.
0:04:35.400000 - 0:04:37.800000::Hold on.
0:04:37.800000 - 0:04:45.120000::That being said, I do think that Greeks are subhuman.
0:04:45.120000 - 0:04:50.120000::They need to be sort of not associated with the rest of us.
0:04:50.120000 - 0:04:55.120000::And if you got a problem with that, me and the lobby after the show, I'll smack the
0:04:55.120000 - 0:04:57.480000::taziki out your bitch ass.

0:05:00 - 0:05:01::Sorry.
0:05:01 - 0:05:02::To Ziki.
0:05:02 - 0:05:03::To Ziki.
0:05:03 - 0:05:05::That's how you say it.
0:05:05 - 0:05:06::Yeah, it's how you say it.
0:05:06 - 0:05:07::Who cares?
0:05:07 - 0:05:08::Who can talk about that?
0:05:08 - 0:05:12::One of the hardest times to pronounce other languages that I've ever shown you in the
0:05:12 - 0:05:13::time.
0:05:13 - 0:05:14::Give me some of your other languages.
0:05:14 - 0:05:15::Orcissus or sauce.
0:05:15 - 0:05:16::Yeah, try that.
0:05:16 - 0:05:18::What language is that in?
0:05:18 - 0:05:19::Saus...
0:05:19 - 0:05:20::Saus...
0:05:20 - 0:05:21::Language...
0:05:21 - 0:05:24::How are you gonna say it?
0:05:24 - 0:05:25::The Saus...
0:05:25 - 0:05:26::You don't know Saus...
0:05:26 - 0:05:29::We are the three dumbest people in the world.
0:05:29 - 0:05:30::Three point two.
0:05:30 - 0:05:31::No, wait a minute.
0:05:31 - 0:05:32::Waited.
0:05:32 - 0:05:33::Oh.
0:05:33 - 0:05:36::Got a weighted three point two.
0:05:36 - 0:05:39::You couldn't even imagine.
0:05:39 - 0:05:40::Well, yeah.
0:05:40 - 0:05:41::Oh, yeah.
0:05:41 - 0:05:42::We are starting a catchphrase.
0:05:42 - 0:05:43::We are the ground floor of a new catchphrase.
0:05:43 - 0:05:44::It is all, yeah.
0:05:44 - 0:05:45::Oh, yeah.
0:05:45 - 0:05:46::You can say it whenever.
0:05:46 - 0:05:51::Whenever you get at a graduation of funeral, you can say that you're a
0:05:51 - 0:05:52::deathbed.
0:05:52 - 0:05:53::You can say it whenever.
0:05:53 - 0:05:54::You can say it whenever.
0:05:54 - 0:05:55::Whenever.
0:05:55 - 0:05:56::You can say it at a graduation of funeral.
0:05:56 - 0:05:57::You can say it at a deathbed.
0:05:57 - 0:05:58::You can say it at a deathbed.
0:05:58 - 0:05:59::You can say it at a deathbed.
0:05:59 - 0:06:00::Eric, I said that.
0:06:00 - 0:06:01::Eric.
0:06:01 - 0:06:02::Speaking of death.
0:06:02 - 0:06:03::I'll just say this.
0:06:03 - 0:06:04::You know, I'm sure you all go to a lot of shows.
0:06:04 - 0:06:15::I'm sure you're doing a lot of different things every night.
0:06:15 - 0:06:16::But tonight is special.
0:06:16 - 0:06:20::I want you to remember that tonight is special because I want everybody to
0:06:20 - 0:06:23::look around right now, look around the room, look at each other.
0:06:23 - 0:06:24::Remember this.
0:06:24 - 0:06:28::Is that someone in here is going to be the first to die.
0:06:28 - 0:06:30::Someone in here is going to pass away.
0:06:30 - 0:06:31::First, who's it going to be?
0:06:31 - 0:06:32::It's not going to be me.
0:06:32 - 0:06:34::I'm on the CPAP machine.
0:06:34 - 0:06:39::It's bringing back my health in a way that no one ever, I'm bringing on more sexually vigorous than I've ever been in my entire life.
0:06:39 - 0:06:40::Nothing.
0:06:40 - 0:06:43::But someone in here is going to go first.
0:06:43 - 0:06:45::And maybe it's going to be you.
0:06:45 - 0:06:47::So just appreciate your lives while you got them.
0:06:47 - 0:06:49::We are not, we are headed to fucking hell.
0:06:49 - 0:06:52::The United States will fall within 50 years.
0:06:52 - 0:06:55::Brooklyn and Silver Lake will rise.
0:06:55 - 0:06:59::In about 100 years, the artists and the creatives.
0:06:59 - 0:07:00::Thank you for the lights.
0:07:00 - 0:07:04::And the ad agency folk will rise up when we will crush other nations.
0:07:04 - 0:07:07::One democratic state across the entire world.
0:07:07 - 0:07:10::All Democrats united under one American leader.
0:07:10 - 0:07:12::Give it up for the Democrats.
0:07:12 - 0:07:13::Woo!
0:07:13 - 0:07:15::Hey, am I new we were in a Democratic crowd tonight.
0:07:15 - 0:07:16::I can feel it.
0:07:16 - 0:07:17::I was scared.
0:07:17 - 0:07:18::I was scared for a second.
0:07:18 - 0:07:19::Oh my God.
0:07:19 - 0:07:23::I'll go down on any Democrat for as long as they want.
0:07:23 - 0:07:26::Four or five hours doing everything.
0:07:26 - 0:07:29::You see that John Federman I'd go down on his behalf.
0:07:29 - 0:07:31::No Federer, sex of Willie.
0:07:31 - 0:07:34::Somebody give him some fucking head dude.
0:07:34 - 0:07:37::He's getting it with that confidence.
0:07:37 - 0:07:40::He's got a beautiful family.
0:07:40 - 0:07:42::He's got a beautiful head.
0:07:43 - 0:07:46::Shouldn't kissing be called going down on each other's mouths?
0:07:46 - 0:07:48::That's a good yeah.
0:07:48 - 0:07:49::I won't say that again.
0:07:49 - 0:07:50::Oh yeah.
0:07:50 - 0:07:51::Oh yeah.
0:07:51 - 0:07:52::Not here.
0:07:52 - 0:07:53::Well here's the thing.
0:07:53 - 0:07:57::Listen, I want to you know, there's one thing about this podcast that is true.
0:07:57 - 0:07:59::It's that we want to change the world.
0:07:59 - 0:08:04::Now, we don't care if it's for good or whatever, but we want to be a part of it, right?
0:08:04 - 0:08:06::And I've been on this mission for a long time.
0:08:06 - 0:08:09::I've been trying to change the world and I've been trying to do it with my art.
0:08:10 - 0:08:12::You know to stand up comedy, excuse me.
0:08:12 - 0:08:16::And so for years I've been thinking why don't I do a joke about what I look like, right?
0:08:16 - 0:08:19::Because technically everybody looks like something.
0:08:19 - 0:08:22::A circle of square, a shape, whatever.
0:08:22 - 0:08:29::So anyway, sometimes I think of a joke while I look like I'm sitting in Times Square to starbucks drinking a diet coke where I do my riding with a bunch of people that are whatever.
0:08:29 - 0:08:30::Anyway, security.
0:08:30 - 0:08:32::Anyway, so I think what do I look like man?
0:08:32 - 0:08:37::I'm like I look like if Michael Sarah was an eight mile or something.
0:08:37 - 0:08:40::I don't know, nobody knows who Michael Sarah is.
0:08:40 - 0:08:46::I'm thinking I look like if John Grzyski grew up too close to an airport.
0:08:46 - 0:08:50::I don't know what that means.
0:08:50 - 0:08:51::You know what I mean?
0:08:51 - 0:08:52::I don't think that means anything.
0:08:52 - 0:08:58::I'm thinking I look like if Michael Phelps and said again caught smoking pot, got caught being all kind of little too handy with his PE kids and all that.
0:08:58 - 0:09:02::I'm thinking well, I don't need to be making a joke about that subject matter, right?
0:09:02 - 0:09:03::It's not my place.
0:09:03 - 0:09:04::Somebody else could.
0:09:04 - 0:09:08::I'm thinking why can't I think of a joke about what I look like?
0:09:08 - 0:09:09::Yup.
0:09:09 - 0:09:16::And what I realized is, it doesn't matter what you look like.
0:09:16 - 0:09:22::What matters is being having to be sharing different perspectives with one another.
0:09:22 - 0:09:26::Hammurabi's code, supply and demand.
0:09:26 - 0:09:28::La-yield.
0:09:28 - 0:09:31::Whatever things we all learn, I've learned.
0:09:31 - 0:09:35::What was I, why did I say all that?
0:09:35 - 0:09:37::Oh yeah, because we want to change the world.
0:09:37 - 0:09:39::Well, butterfly effects.
0:09:39 - 0:09:43::I just change it again in a way so.
0:09:43 - 0:09:49::If you thought I was going to wrap it up and make a point.
0:09:49 - 0:09:50::No, that doesn't happen.
0:09:50 - 0:09:51::That's not going to happen.
0:09:51 - 0:09:53::We are here to change lives tonight though.
0:09:53 - 0:09:54::That's for real.
0:09:54 - 0:09:55::Yeah.
0:09:55 - 0:09:56::Who's feeling down lately?
0:09:56 - 0:09:57::Who's feeling depressed?
0:09:57 - 0:09:58::Everyone raises their hands.
0:09:58 - 0:09:59::I never felt that in my life.

0:10:00 - 0:10:01.340000::It's a athletic approach, man.
0:10:01.340000 - 0:10:02.340000::I got to be there for each other.
0:10:02.340000 - 0:10:04.340000::I'm gonna be there for each other.
0:10:04.340000 - 0:10:05.940000::Who in the front row in the distance
0:10:05.940000 - 0:10:08.040000::of the mic cord is feeling depressed?
0:10:09.140000 - 0:10:09.980000::You are, brother.
0:10:09.980000 - 0:10:10.820000::I'm gonna go on.
0:10:10.820000 - 0:10:12.180000::All the weirdly all men.
0:10:13.300000 - 0:10:14.580000::And invisible disease.
0:10:14.580000 - 0:10:16.580000::I can see it on your face though.
0:10:16.580000 - 0:10:17.420000::Yeah, man, I can see it.
0:10:17.420000 - 0:10:18.260000::It's not invisible, man.
0:10:18.260000 - 0:10:19.420000::Those fuckers.
0:10:20.660000 - 0:10:22.660000::What do you, what do you go on through, man?
0:10:24.100000 - 0:10:26.620000::Hold on, hold on, hold on.
0:10:27.660000 - 0:10:28.460000::Hold on, hold on.
0:10:28.460000 - 0:10:29.620000::No, that sucks.
0:10:31 - 0:10:32::Check, tall.
0:10:34 - 0:10:36::Are you willing to be interviewed?
0:10:36 - 0:10:37::Sure.
0:10:37 - 0:10:38::Okay.
0:10:38 - 0:10:39::All right.
0:10:39 - 0:10:41::And it's okay if we post this online.
0:10:41 - 0:10:42::In perpetuity?
0:10:42 - 0:10:43::Okay.
0:10:43 - 0:10:45::We're working with the new Chinese social media app
0:10:45 - 0:10:49::and they'll do whatever they want with your ass, but...
0:10:49 - 0:10:51::Yeah, that's just chill.
0:10:51 - 0:10:52::So what's your name, brother?
0:10:52 - 0:10:53::Alex.
0:10:53 - 0:10:54::That's my brother's name.
0:10:54 - 0:10:55::Oh, great.
0:10:55 - 0:10:56::I knew it got name Alex too.
0:10:57 - 0:10:59::You probably know a lot of guys named Alex.
0:10:59 - 0:11:00::Yeah, that's right.
0:11:08 - 0:11:09::No, I'm not bad.
0:11:10 - 0:11:12::Alex, what do you do for a living, brother?
0:11:12 - 0:11:13::I'm in the film industry.
0:11:13 - 0:11:14::Do editing.
0:11:14 - 0:11:15::D.D. Alan.
0:11:15 - 0:11:16::Wow.
0:11:16 - 0:11:17::So you think?
0:11:17 - 0:11:18::So you think?
0:11:18 - 0:11:19::Kind of why we wanted to do this show, man.
0:11:19 - 0:11:21::We could talk afterwards about communication.
0:11:21 - 0:11:22::Yeah.
0:11:22 - 0:11:23::We...
0:11:23 - 0:11:24::That is amazing.
0:11:24 - 0:11:25::That's L.A. for you.
0:11:25 - 0:11:26::That's good, yeah.
0:11:26 - 0:11:27::You can do it for the industry.
0:11:27 - 0:11:28::Okay, no, no, no, no, no.
0:11:28 - 0:11:31::Actually, I message you guys on the Patreon about it too.
0:11:31 - 0:11:33::No, you were...
0:11:33 - 0:11:34::Oh, I got it.
0:11:34 - 0:11:35::You were responding.
0:11:35 - 0:11:36::We were responding.
0:11:36 - 0:11:37::Ooh.
0:11:37 - 0:11:38::No, no, it wasn't.
0:11:38 - 0:11:39::Ooh, it wasn't.
0:11:39 - 0:11:40::I was...
0:11:40 - 0:11:41::You guys responded.
0:11:41 - 0:11:42::We did it too.
0:11:42 - 0:11:44::Yeah, we responded to messages.
0:11:44 - 0:11:45::DM us.
0:11:45 - 0:11:46::Yeah, we were responding.
0:11:46 - 0:11:48::We got a pay to do.
0:11:48 - 0:11:51::I'm jumping out a bit at 3am.
0:11:51 - 0:11:53::Refining to all y'all.
0:11:53 - 0:11:54::But you're...
0:11:54 - 0:11:55::I have a question for you, Alex.
0:11:55 - 0:12:00::Are you scared of AI taking over your job?
0:12:00 - 0:12:03::Uh, not my job.
0:12:03 - 0:12:04::I think I'm good.
0:12:04 - 0:12:05::Good, good.
0:12:05 - 0:12:06::You'll be better.
0:12:06 - 0:12:07::You'll be better.
0:12:07 - 0:12:09::Yeah, I think...
0:12:09 - 0:12:14::I kind of feel the same way, because you see AI doing something shit like this?
0:12:14 - 0:12:17::Hell no.
0:12:17 - 0:12:19::Hell no.
0:12:19 - 0:12:20::I'm good.
0:12:20 - 0:12:21::No.
0:12:21 - 0:12:22::I'm good.
0:12:22 - 0:12:23::No.
0:12:23 - 0:12:24::I'm good.
0:12:24 - 0:12:25::I'm good.
0:12:25 - 0:12:28::AI, you're a fuck, you're a fuck, you're a...
0:12:28 - 0:12:29::Not me.
0:12:29 - 0:12:31::What did you just do?
0:12:31 - 0:12:34::Something to say, I can't do.
0:12:34 - 0:12:35::Yeah, I hear that.
0:12:35 - 0:12:37::Hey, well, I...
0:12:37 - 0:12:41::So, Alex, you are suffering from loneliness.
0:12:41 - 0:12:42::Loneliness.
0:12:42 - 0:12:43::Loneliness.
0:12:43 - 0:12:46::Well, because you're editing, right?
0:12:46 - 0:12:49::Now, that's what you are, right?
0:12:49 - 0:12:50::Yeah, yeah.
0:12:50 - 0:12:53::So, that's pretty lonely at times.
0:12:53 - 0:12:56::I would imagine you're alone doing that, right?
0:12:56 - 0:12:57::Day to day, right?
0:12:57 - 0:12:58::Yeah, I'll do.
0:12:58 - 0:12:59::Is it my own in a room?
0:12:59 - 0:13:01::Yeah, in my office alone, I'll do.
0:13:01 - 0:13:03::That sucks, man.
0:13:03 - 0:13:06::Have you ever thought of getting on Omega while you're editing?
0:13:06 - 0:13:10::You know, we're like, jerk, or made.com, right?
0:13:10 - 0:13:14::There's a lot of campsites that get out, I feel like you're getting really...
0:13:14 - 0:13:15::Ah, that's a good idea.
0:13:15 - 0:13:16::I got to try that.
0:13:16 - 0:13:17::Yeah, but...
0:13:17 - 0:13:19::So, oh, yeah, right.
0:13:19 - 0:13:23::Is that where you feel like the loneliness is mostly happening?
0:13:23 - 0:13:24::Is that work or is it all...
0:13:24 - 0:13:27::Or is it this city full of rats that you can't fucking make one?
0:13:27 - 0:13:29::These snakes out here, and I see a couple of...
0:13:29 - 0:13:30::But here's a rat.
0:13:30 - 0:13:32::These are the beacons of light.
0:13:32 - 0:13:35::He's the only person that trusts in LA.
0:13:36 - 0:13:37::What's your name?
0:13:37 - 0:13:38::I like to trust people.
0:13:38 - 0:13:39::Carlos.
0:13:39 - 0:13:40::Carlos.
0:13:40 - 0:13:41::I'm not sure.
0:13:41 - 0:13:42::Carlos, trust me, man.
0:13:42 - 0:13:43::Thank you.
0:13:43 - 0:13:46::Carlos is wearing a Kenneth Cole hat right now.
0:13:46 - 0:13:51::And that is one of the biggest, the most tell-tale signs of a trustworthy person.
0:13:51 - 0:13:52::Thank you.
0:13:52 - 0:13:54::It was my late grandfather's.
0:13:54 - 0:13:55::Are you serious?
0:13:55 - 0:13:56::Yes.
0:13:56 - 0:13:57::Wow.
0:13:57 - 0:13:59::And what do you do for living?
0:13:59 - 0:14:02::I sell gym memberships at Equinox.
0:14:02 - 0:14:04::Oh, yeah.
0:14:04 - 0:14:05::Yeah, so let me know.
0:14:05 - 0:14:07::You guys need a 70-pass.
0:14:07 - 0:14:12::I got you a 50% discount on the membership.
0:14:12 - 0:14:13::Oh, dude.
0:14:13 - 0:14:15::So you only pay like $7,000 a month?
0:14:15 - 0:14:17::God, you be an asshole.
0:14:17 - 0:14:18::God, you...
0:14:18 - 0:14:19::Oh, man.
0:14:19 - 0:14:21::I did a sleep deprivation...
0:14:21 - 0:14:22::Huh?
0:14:22 - 0:14:25::A sleep deprivation tank?
0:14:25 - 0:14:28::That is a torture device.
0:14:28 - 0:14:30::Oh, man.
0:14:30 - 0:14:36::I accidentally said one of my own YouTube videos, I guess.
0:14:36 - 0:14:41::I did a sensory deprivation tank at an Equinox one time.
0:14:41 - 0:14:42::Thanks, man.
0:14:42 - 0:14:44::I got you, man.
0:14:44 - 0:14:45::Anytime.
0:14:45 - 0:14:46::Anytime.
0:14:46 - 0:14:47::Oh, yeah.
0:14:47 - 0:14:48::But I want to fix it.
0:14:48 - 0:14:49::I want to fix it.
0:14:49 - 0:14:50::Alex is lonely.
0:14:50 - 0:14:51::Oh, yeah.
0:14:51 - 0:14:52::Lonelyness really quick.
0:14:52 - 0:14:53::Yeah, thank you.
0:14:53 - 0:14:54::Where can you go?
0:14:54 - 0:14:56::Because my brother named Alex is lonely as well.
0:14:56 - 0:14:59::Alex, if you're listening to this, I don't think you'd mind me saying that.
0:14:59 - 0:15:00::Oh, we're all...

0:15:00 - 0:15:01.200000::I'm not lonely for a lower guy.
0:15:01.200000 - 0:15:02.200000::And I'm like, how do you,
0:15:02.200000 - 0:15:03.940000::because I have some of the best friends in the world right here
0:15:03.940000 - 0:15:08::and we podcast, I'm not lonely, but I feel like,
0:15:08 - 0:15:11.160000::how do you find community these days?
0:15:11.160000 - 0:15:12::You know what I mean?
0:15:12 - 0:15:13::It's really tough.
0:15:13 - 0:15:13.720000::Volunteering, boring.
0:15:13.720000 - 0:15:14.960000::Well, it's, it's,
0:15:16.960000 - 0:15:18.520000::well we're so atomized in this country.
0:15:18.520000 - 0:15:19.800000::I heard we could call it a country.
0:15:19.800000 - 0:15:20.640000::It's a marketplace.
0:15:20.640000 - 0:15:22.960000::These people come, there's no, it's disgusting.
0:15:22.960000 - 0:15:23.800000::It makes me sick.
0:15:23.800000 - 0:15:24.880000::We're all pitted against each other.
0:15:24.880000 - 0:15:25.720000::There's nothing we can do.
0:15:25.720000 - 0:15:26.640000::We all want each other to die.
0:15:26.640000 - 0:15:27.480000::It's competition.
0:15:27.480000 - 0:15:28.480000::It's a domination society.
0:15:28.480000 - 0:15:29.480000::What can we do about it?
0:15:30 - 0:15:31.280000::Here's what we can do about it.
0:15:35.280000 - 0:15:38.360000::Well, yeah, I guess FaceTime people helps.
0:15:38.360000 - 0:15:39.560000::You know what I mean?
0:15:39.560000 - 0:15:40.800000::What's one interest of yours?
0:15:40.800000 - 0:15:41.640000::We'll wrap this up,
0:15:41.640000 - 0:15:43.800000::but what's one interest of yours?
0:15:43.800000 - 0:15:45.120000::Outside of film.
0:15:45.120000 - 0:15:47.600000::I mean, I do like comedy too.
0:15:47.600000 - 0:15:49.400000::Who likes comedy in here?
0:15:49.400000 - 0:15:50.640000::Raise your hands.
0:15:50.640000 - 0:15:53.120000::You, I find about 100 and whatever,
0:15:53.120000 - 0:15:54.600000::new friends for you right now.
0:15:54.600000 - 0:15:55.680000::Well, let me tell you something.
0:15:55.680000 - 0:15:57.960000::Comedy is probably the worst possible community
0:15:57.960000 - 0:15:59.120000::you could ever be a part of.
0:15:59.120000 - 0:16:02.400000::So don't, I think you need to find new interests, man,
0:16:02.400000 - 0:16:04.080000::because that's not a place to look.
0:16:04.080000 - 0:16:06.800000::There are a lot of bad people in the comedy industry.
0:16:06.800000 - 0:16:07.400000::Not us.
0:16:07.400000 - 0:16:09.960000::We're the three of the good ones.
0:16:09.960000 - 0:16:11.080000::You should get into racing.
0:16:12.840000 - 0:16:13.440000::Cars?
0:16:13.440000 - 0:16:14.640000::By foot, all right?
0:16:14.640000 - 0:16:16.520000::Yeah, or by foot, whatever.
0:16:16.520000 - 0:16:17.320000::Just go crazy.
0:16:17.320000 - 0:16:20.560000::You could do multi-modal racing as well.
0:16:20.560000 - 0:16:21.160000::You understand?
0:16:21.160000 - 0:16:21.680000::What's that?
0:16:21.680000 - 0:16:24::So what you would do is you'd have somebody on foot,
0:16:24 - 0:16:25.640000::somebody on a car, somebody on a bike,
0:16:25.640000 - 0:16:27.800000::somebody on a animal, someone on a whatever.
0:16:27.800000 - 0:16:31.120000::Somebody tied down with a brick, so they gotta go slower.
0:16:31.120000 - 0:16:33.160000::But everybody gets a certain handicap, right?
0:16:33.160000 - 0:16:36::So the person in the car can't start for 26 minutes.
0:16:36 - 0:16:38.200000::And the person with the water, brick gets to go whatever.
0:16:38.200000 - 0:16:39.680000::Anyways.
0:16:39.680000 - 0:16:41.640000::Racing.
0:16:41.640000 - 0:16:42.400000::All right, we'll try that out.
0:16:42.400000 - 0:16:43.240000::We'll try that out.

0:26:24.280000 - 0:26:28.920000::and it could be a setup a little bit for a comeback?
0:26:28.920000 - 0:26:34.560000::I feel like I could take this opportunity to just completely starve myself
0:26:34.560000 - 0:26:38.720000::and come out the end of this looking like an L810.
0:26:38.720000 - 0:26:40.320000::Oh, shit.
0:26:40.320000 - 0:26:42::Am I getting laughs right now?

0:27:37.320000 - 0:27:39.200000::Why, because I'm so heavy.
0:27:39.200000 - 0:27:40.880000::I thought I was skinny.
0:27:40.880000 - 0:27:45.520000::No, you have no fat on your neck or anywhere.
0:27:45.520000 - 0:27:50.640000::I know that's where I'm the most conscious of my fat deposits.
0:27:50.640000 - 0:27:51.920000::Deposit?
0:27:51.920000 - 0:27:58.720000::Sarah, you are bombing harder than I've ever seen something you've caught right now.
0:27:58.720000 - 0:28:00.720000::I don't know if you're walking out.

0:28:29.120000 - 0:28:31.120000::Everyone's flipping you off right now.
0:28:31.120000 - 0:28:32.120000::Yeah.
0:28:32.120000 - 0:28:35.120000::They laughed at you when you said that.

0:29:05.120000 - 0:29:06.120000::You're crushing.
0:29:06.120000 - 0:29:07.120000::They love you, Sarah.
0:29:07.120000 - 0:29:09.120000::Hey, so how many people are in the audience?

0:29:13.120000 - 0:29:15.120000::They're literally never seen the dynasty.
0:29:15.120000 - 0:29:16.520000::This sold out before.
0:29:16.520000 - 0:29:18.720000::There's people trying to break in right now.
0:29:18.720000 - 0:29:19.720000::Zombie style.
0:29:19.720000 - 0:29:20.720000::Because it's so fun here.
0:29:20.720000 - 0:29:24.720000::There's a bus full of Joy-Tackers India fans on the way about to.
0:29:24.720000 - 0:29:25.720000::A bus?
0:29:25.720000 - 0:29:26.720000::The rest of it.
0:29:26.720000 - 0:29:27.720000::Lining up the halls.
0:29:27.720000 - 0:29:29.320000::They've had to double-decker the seats.
0:29:29.320000 - 0:29:32.520000::There's two people sitting on each other's laps in the seats.
0:29:32.520000 - 0:29:37.120000::So they're sleep deprived, but they need to see us before I go.
0:29:37.120000 - 0:29:41.920000::I get like huge bar back energy from the front row.
0:29:41.920000 - 0:29:42.920000::That's no.
0:29:42.920000 - 0:29:43.920000::That's the right person.
0:29:43.920000 - 0:29:44.920000::That's the front row.
0:29:44.920000 - 0:29:45.920000::That's the film editor.
0:29:45.920000 - 0:29:46.920000::They can handle it.
0:29:46.920000 - 0:29:47.920000::You'd come in.
0:29:47.920000 - 0:29:50.920000::Dude, there's industry here, OK?
0:29:50.920000 - 0:29:52.920000::There are industry here.
0:29:52.920000 - 0:29:55.920000::And you're going to regret making fun of them.
0:29:55.920000 - 0:29:58.920000::I was starting to sweat from holding the phone up.
0:29:58.920000 - 0:29:59.920000::You're doing a great job.

0:30:00 - 0:30:01.460000::I don't believe you have the phone.
0:30:01.460000 - 0:30:02.460000::I feel like I'm going to get a great job.
0:30:02.460000 - 0:30:04.340000::You're all in one fucking sense.
0:30:04.340000 - 0:30:08.900000::I'm starting to sweat from having 110 degree fever.
0:30:08.900000 - 0:30:10.140000::Are you fevered out right now?
0:30:10.140000 - 0:30:12.620000::She doesn't have a fever or a lax.
0:30:12.620000 - 0:30:13.540000::She's too healthy.
0:30:13.540000 - 0:30:14.420000::She's all small.
0:30:14.420000 - 0:30:16.780000::She's going to outlive all of us for the love of God.
0:30:16.780000 - 0:30:17.620000::Right?
0:30:17.620000 - 0:30:19.680000::What's the first to go out of us?
0:30:19.680000 - 0:30:20.620000::Out of the three?
0:30:20.620000 - 0:30:22.060000::Oh, that's a good question for Sarah.
0:30:22.060000 - 0:30:24.140000::Who out of the four of us is going to be all dead
0:30:24.140000 - 0:30:25.980000::and whatnot first?
0:30:25.980000 - 0:30:28.620000::Well, do you want me to answer it honestly or comment?
0:30:28.620000 - 0:30:29.460000::It's a comedy show.
0:30:29.460000 - 0:30:30.300000::Do the funny thing.
0:30:30.300000 - 0:30:31.620000::You're just crazy.
0:30:31.620000 - 0:30:32.820000::Oh, you can be honest.
0:30:32.820000 - 0:30:33.820000::I'm going to live.
0:30:33.820000 - 0:30:34.820000::I'm listening.
0:30:34.820000 - 0:30:37.380000::I'm going to live until I'm 380 years old.
0:30:37.380000 - 0:30:41.340000::And everybody's going to wish I will have died.
0:30:41.340000 - 0:30:42.540000::That's an L2.
0:30:42.540000 - 0:30:43.540000::That's an L2?
0:30:43.540000 - 0:30:45.460000::It's the first to go.
0:30:45.460000 - 0:30:48.780000::But it's going to be really shiny.

0:30:49.980000 - 0:30:51.820000::But it's going to be really shiny.
0:30:51.820000 - 0:30:54.020000::Yeah, it's going to be dramatic.
0:30:54.020000 - 0:30:55.940000::It's going to be like a John Lennon fucking one
0:30:55.940000 - 0:30:56.700000::with a bazooka.
0:30:58.700000 - 0:31:01.900000::Yeah, right outside my New York penthouse.
0:31:01.900000 - 0:31:04.540000::You're going to die by the hands of a fan of yours.
0:31:04.540000 - 0:31:05.380000::For sure.

0:31:12.460000 - 0:31:16.740000::Neat is going to get assassinated by a big Greek guy.
0:31:16.740000 - 0:31:17.060000::We're sure.
0:31:17.060000 - 0:31:18.100000::I welcome that.
0:31:18.100000 - 0:31:19.700000::I fully accept that.
0:31:19.700000 - 0:31:22.140000::I piss them off so much throughout the years,
0:31:22.140000 - 0:31:24.740000::throughout the decades that I rightfully deserve that.
0:31:25.420000 - 0:31:27.700000::And Jack, what do you think about Jack?
0:31:27.700000 - 0:31:29.140000::What's his whole house?
0:31:29.140000 - 0:31:31.380000::Jack's going to be like 50 three years old,
0:31:31.380000 - 0:31:33.220000::and he's going to be like, wait, you guys,
0:31:33.220000 - 0:31:35.460000::I can still skateboard really good.
0:31:35.460000 - 0:31:36.460000::I knew you had that out of skateboard
0:31:36.460000 - 0:31:39.620000::and immediately get exploded by a bus.
0:31:41.620000 - 0:31:45.220000::All right, I can see that.
0:31:45.220000 - 0:31:50.860000::Sarah, being on, we've been on tour together this whole summer,

0:31:57.660000 - 0:32:00.500000::You know, I don't know.
0:32:00.500000 - 0:32:01.500000::Yeah.

0:32:50.500000 - 0:32:51.500000::What's that?
0:32:51.500000 - 0:32:52.500000::If you could do this Jewish version of it.
0:32:52.500000 - 0:32:54.500000::Is someone holding a piece of paper in the air?
0:32:54.500000 - 0:32:55.500000::What's that about?
0:32:55.500000 - 0:32:58.500000::So I have something for Sarah that I couldn't get to her last night.

0:33:07.500000 - 0:33:10.500000::It's paper, maybe.
0:33:16.500000 - 0:33:18.500000::Holy shit.
0:33:19.500000 - 0:33:21.500000::And can I get some?

0:33:24.500000 - 0:33:27.500000::Should we describe what not with the card is, but the beautiful gift?

0:33:29.500000 - 0:33:31.500000::And what are they just for?

0:33:38.500000 - 0:33:40.500000::And blue babies.
0:33:40.500000 - 0:33:44.500000::Eric, you're always describing things as Jewish.
0:33:44.500000 - 0:33:46.500000::Out of respect.
0:33:49.500000 - 0:33:51.500000::Out of deep respect.
0:33:51.500000 - 0:33:54.500000::But no, they are Jewish.
0:33:54.500000 - 0:33:56.500000::Oh yeah, they got...
0:33:56.500000 - 0:33:57.500000::Yeah, I don't want to.
0:33:57.500000 - 0:33:59.500000::Do you want to see them Sarah up close?
0:33:59.500000 - 0:34:02.500000::Oh wait, did my growths make these?

0:34:09.500000 - 0:34:11.500000::We only got one gift for her.
0:34:11.500000 - 0:34:13.500000::Oh no, somebody...
0:34:13.500000 - 0:34:15.500000::When we were on tour in Madison,
0:34:15.500000 - 0:34:17.500000::somebody gave me a gift that was a ransom note that said,
0:34:17.500000 - 0:34:19.500000::I listened to your podcast.
0:34:19.500000 - 0:34:20.500000::That was pretty scary.

0:34:29.500000 - 0:34:31.500000::Something like that.
0:34:31.500000 - 0:34:34.500000::Well, I think we might need to move on to our next hot guest
0:34:34.500000 - 0:34:36.500000::and kick Sarah back to the depths of illness.
0:34:36.500000 - 0:34:39.500000::Okay, we'll see you at the Airbnb.

0:39:05.300000 - 0:39:07.460000::Wait, Jack, before you sit down,
0:39:07.460000 - 0:39:09.120000::before you sit down, could you play your song
0:39:09.120000 - 0:39:12.140000::in the piano to kind of kick off the interview with John?
0:39:12.140000 - 0:39:14.220000::People don't know this, but all of us are,
0:39:14.220000 - 0:39:16.620000::I would say John, including, is a musician.
0:39:16.620000 - 0:39:18.340000::We are all very talented musicians.
0:39:18.340000 - 0:39:19.340000::Yes.
0:39:19.340000 - 0:39:23.140000::And Jack, go crazy on the piano, please.
0:39:23.140000 - 0:39:24.140000::I wrote.
0:39:24.140000 - 0:39:25.140000::I wrote.
0:39:25.140000 - 0:39:30.820000::I'm going to put a mic up to the piano.
0:39:30.820000 - 0:39:31.820000::All right.
0:39:31.820000 - 0:39:36.820000::What the fuck is this?
0:39:36.820000 - 0:39:38.740000::That's it man.

0:40:00 - 0:40:04.480000::That is like a composer that was Russian in the 30s that got dementia pretty bad
0:40:05.440000 - 0:40:07.440000::And it can still kind of play but
0:40:08.560000 - 0:40:14.840000::It was so good that it almost tipped over into being fake. Yeah, you know, no, yeah, it's shocking
0:40:14.840000 - 0:40:17.720000::I know what you mean too well now wait
0:40:19.320000 - 0:40:23.320000::Yes, man, can you describe how you learned how to play that song?
0:40:23.320000 - 0:40:25.320000::Because you don't know
0:40:26.280000 - 0:40:28.280000::28 29
0:40:30.600000 - 0:40:34.640000::Would you say that was my first question earlier you are your 28
0:40:35.400000 - 0:40:40.280000::Okay, what did you say it in here? When did your mom gets you into piano lessons on tea?

0:40:57.240000 - 0:41:04.280000::I thought how hard could it really be because I saw a five-year-old doing it on YouTube and so never played piano before
0:41:04.280000 - 0:41:09.720000::He would just saw this song and he was just like go everyday so every day for probably an hour

0:46:59 - 0:47:02::I have many insights into it.
0:47:02 - 0:47:05::I'm going to talk about this.
0:47:05 - 0:47:06::Okay, please.
0:47:06 - 0:47:07::Okay.
0:47:07 - 0:47:08::Jonas.
0:47:08 - 0:47:12::Jonas was so fine.
0:47:12 - 0:47:15::He was like, he had a really husky voice.
0:47:16 - 0:47:18::I realized that I'm...
0:47:18 - 0:47:20::I don't know, husky.
0:47:20 - 0:47:22::It was like, oh, raspy.
0:47:22 - 0:47:23::Oh, okay.
0:47:23 - 0:47:24::Rock-eyed-ass.
0:47:24 - 0:47:25::Oh, call it.
0:47:25 - 0:47:26::Call it.
0:47:26 - 0:47:27::Gus.
0:47:27 - 0:47:28::Yeah.
0:47:28 - 0:47:31::But he and I realized that I'm now talking about a 12-year-old.
0:47:31 - 0:47:32::No, no, no, no.
0:47:32 - 0:47:33::Oh, no.
0:47:33 - 0:47:34::He's still 12.
0:47:34 - 0:47:35::Whatever he is.
0:47:35 - 0:47:36::No, he's still 12.
0:47:36 - 0:47:38::But then he was...
0:47:38 - 0:47:39::He's his Jonas.
0:47:39 - 0:47:42::He's one of the first to still be 12.
0:47:42 - 0:47:44::His Jonas still with us.
0:47:44 - 0:47:45::He's still with us.
0:47:45 - 0:47:46::Good.
0:47:46 - 0:47:47::Yeah, good.
0:47:47 - 0:47:48::And he had DJ.
0:47:48 - 0:47:50::He said, oh, what the hell?
0:47:50 - 0:47:52::Comedian actor, DJ, theater owner.
0:47:52 - 0:47:53::What the hell?
0:47:53 - 0:47:54::School.
0:47:54 - 0:47:55::Not yet.
0:47:55 - 0:48:01::My source in Tennessee said, it would be insane for him to not say Jonas.
0:48:01 - 0:48:02::Oh, my God.
0:48:02 - 0:48:03::Well, I'm going to be clear.
0:48:03 - 0:48:07::And this is a band, by the way, and your high school or something there in a band?
0:48:07 - 0:48:08::Well, it's Jonas.
0:48:08 - 0:48:11::Yeah, then was in a band called Be Your Own Pet.
0:48:11 - 0:48:13::I could have...
0:48:14 - 0:48:16::Oh, John, I could have finished that sentence for you.

0:53:22.100000 - 0:53:22.600000::That gave me joy.
0:53:22.600000 - 0:53:25.400000::I was this close to John.
0:53:25.400000 - 0:53:28.300000::I don't know what I was doing.
0:53:28.300000 - 0:53:32.800000::I was cackling my fucking ass off at that.
0:53:32.800000 - 0:53:34.300000::Especially it was so fucking good.
0:53:34.300000 - 0:53:37.500000::I was like, thank God somebody's bringing the fucking heat

0:53:44.800000 - 0:53:45.800000::Respect.
0:53:45.800000 - 0:53:46.800000::Respect.
0:53:46.800000 - 0:53:47.800000::You passed the test.
0:53:47.800000 - 0:53:49.400000::Oh, striking workers out there.
0:53:49.400000 - 0:53:51.600000::Let's give it up for the striking workers.
0:53:51.600000 - 0:53:53.900000::But I want to spoil something in the special.
0:53:53.900000 - 0:53:57.100000::You had a spotlight that you would go to your parents.
0:53:57.100000 - 0:53:58.100000::And you would go like this.
0:53:58.100000 - 0:53:59.500000::And that was like one of the funny things.
0:53:59.500000 - 0:54:01.700000::But I heard that you had to kind of work that out.
0:54:01.700000 - 0:54:04::Oh, I'm sorry.
0:54:04 - 0:54:06.400000::I heard that you had to work that out.
0:54:06.400000 - 0:54:08.500000::Super hard at a lot of open mics.
0:54:08.500000 - 0:54:10.900000::We'd have to drag your parents to a lot of them
0:54:10.900000 - 0:54:12.600000::and bring a spotlight with you.
0:54:12.600000 - 0:54:14.700000::So that meant it's a long time to work out.
0:54:14.700000 - 0:54:15.900000::That's what I heard.
0:54:15.900000 - 0:54:18.400000::Yeah, I had to get a fucking tour bus.
0:54:18.400000 - 0:54:19.300000::Oh, my God.
0:54:19.300000 - 0:54:22.300000::Wow, just going around to all the open mics in LA.
0:54:22.300000 - 0:54:24.300000::I kind of think I'm watching this special right now
0:54:24.300000 - 0:54:26.300000::just because you're sitting right there in a way.
0:54:26.300000 - 0:54:31.600000::So I ask you all a question.
0:54:31.600000 - 0:54:32.100000::Please.
0:54:32.100000 - 0:54:35.800000::I'm begging you, I'm not choosing.
0:54:35.800000 - 0:54:37.100000::OK, Eric.
0:54:37.100000 - 0:54:38.400000::Oh, yes.
0:54:38.400000 - 0:54:40.900000::You.
0:54:40.900000 - 0:54:43.200000::Eric, you've been in over four short films
0:54:43.200000 - 0:54:45.100000::with some yet to be announced.
0:54:45.100000 - 0:54:50.700000::So more than let's just say about 10 under my name.
0:54:50.700000 - 0:54:55.700000::How do you handle that rigorous schedule
0:54:55.700000 - 0:55:00.100000::while balancing life in the corporate sector?

0:55:00 - 0:55:01.560000::That great question!
0:55:01.560000 - 0:55:02.460000::Great question!
0:55:02.460000 - 0:55:04.040000::Yeah, I appreciate that, John.
0:55:04.040000 - 0:55:04.880000::Water?
0:55:04.880000 - 0:55:06.160000::It's, I don't know.
0:55:06.160000 - 0:55:08.440000::I feel like, and people are starting to recognize me,
0:55:08.440000 - 0:55:12.240000::I got laid off, but right before I got laid off,
0:55:12.240000 - 0:55:15.280000::being recognized that we're weird.
0:55:15.280000 - 0:55:17.880000::No, I just, I really don't have an answer to that.
0:55:17.880000 - 0:55:18.920000::I appreciate the question.
0:55:18.920000 - 0:55:23.160000::We wrote all of these questions, like,
0:55:23.160000 - 0:55:24.880000::bullying, what?
0:55:24.880000 - 0:55:28.400000::The miniature has no response to them.
0:55:28.400000 - 0:55:29.920000::Have you been in short films, John?
0:55:29.920000 - 0:55:30.760000::Yeah.
0:55:30.760000 - 0:55:31.920000::Ah!
0:55:31.920000 - 0:55:34.920000::I'm going to look it up now, I'm a DB Pro.
0:55:34.920000 - 0:55:36.200000::How do they got to call them short?
0:55:36.200000 - 0:55:37.400000::What's your star meter?
0:55:37.400000 - 0:55:39.400000::What's your star meter right now, and I'm DB?
0:55:39.400000 - 0:55:41.040000::4 2 K 1 2.
0:55:41.040000 - 0:55:42.560000::I don't know.
0:55:42.560000 - 0:55:46.760000::Star meter is like a score that goes along with someone's name,
0:55:46.760000 - 0:55:48.440000::and if they're becoming more famous,
0:55:48.440000 - 0:55:50.520000::uh-oh, the star meter increases.
0:55:50.520000 - 0:55:51.040000::Black mirror.
0:55:51.040000 - 0:55:53.760000::I bet you're in the early thousands, maybe even
0:55:53.760000 - 0:55:54.280000::than the hundreds.
0:55:54.280000 - 0:55:55.320000::You might be a four thousand.
0:55:55.320000 - 0:55:56.840000::Yeah, four thousand, yeah.
0:55:56.840000 - 0:55:58.200000::John, you're up there, brother.
0:55:58.200000 - 0:55:59.880000::The star meter is calling your name.
0:55:59.880000 - 0:56:01.160000::Except it.
0:56:01.160000 - 0:56:03.720000::It's, um, but it's so funny when it goes down,
0:56:03.720000 - 0:56:05.080000::it's literally red.
0:56:05.080000 - 0:56:05.920000::Yeah, it's red.
0:56:05.920000 - 0:56:06.920000::It's, it's great.
0:56:06.920000 - 0:56:09.280000::It's not a, it's, it's all right.
0:56:09.280000 - 0:56:11::Nate.
0:56:11 - 0:56:11.520000::OK.
0:56:11.520000 - 0:56:13.520000::Your hair he asked looking like a werewolf.
0:56:13.520000 - 0:56:17.160000::That's 26% loaded.
0:56:17.160000 - 0:56:21.080000::OK, not a question, but, like, move on.
0:56:21.080000 - 0:56:21.840000::That was kind of real.
0:56:21.840000 - 0:56:22.800000::That's a good one.
0:56:22.800000 - 0:56:24.800000::You do kind of like, what does that mean?
0:56:24.800000 - 0:56:25.920000::26% loaded.
0:56:25.920000 - 0:56:28.120000::I'm just so hairy that I'm, like,
0:56:28.120000 - 0:56:29.640000::I'm like, you're not quite there.
0:56:29.640000 - 0:56:31.040000::You know, I'm not quite there.
0:56:31.040000 - 0:56:32.440000::I'm a loading werewolf.
0:56:32.440000 - 0:56:33.320000::Like in the animal.
0:56:33.320000 - 0:56:34.960000::She'd be adding like the second picture.
0:56:34.960000 - 0:56:37.360000::Yeah, yeah, yeah.
0:56:37.360000 - 0:56:38.680000::You're like the Anamorph.
0:56:38.680000 - 0:56:40.200000::Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
0:56:40.200000 - 0:56:41::Yeah, yeah.
0:56:41 - 0:56:43.800000::You look like a werewolf without a peesha,
0:56:43.800000 - 0:56:45.720000::but they just, maybe just try and knock
0:56:45.720000 - 0:56:48.120000::a dollar or something.
0:56:48.120000 - 0:56:48.960000::Yeah.
0:56:48.960000 - 0:56:50.600000::I'm like, I look like a werewolf that
0:56:50.600000 - 0:56:54.680000::staring at the moon through some stained glass.
0:56:54.680000 - 0:56:56.040000::Yeah, you look like a werewolf.
0:56:56.040000 - 0:56:58.320000::Where will fall about when the full moon comes out?
0:56:58.320000 - 0:56:58.840000::Yeah.
0:56:58.840000 - 0:56:59.680000::Yeah, all right.
0:56:59.680000 - 0:57:01.040000::So then maybe a half-john.
0:57:01.040000 - 0:57:02.840000::You look like a good vampire.
0:57:02.840000 - 0:57:05.480000::Like, we need to get you in what we do in the shadows now.
0:57:05.480000 - 0:57:07.480000::We.
0:57:07.480000 - 0:57:08.480000::We.
0:57:08.480000 - 0:57:09.480000::We.
0:57:09.480000 - 0:57:10.480000::Yeah, well, not right now.
0:57:10.480000 - 0:57:12.800000::We have many connections.
0:57:12.800000 - 0:57:13.800000::Men.
0:57:13.800000 - 0:57:14.800000::More than you can imagine, John.
0:57:14.800000 - 0:57:15.800000::You saw the other shadows.
0:57:15.800000 - 0:57:16.400000::New talent.
0:57:16.400000 - 0:57:16.920000::New voices.
0:57:16.920000 - 0:57:17.880000::You haven't heard of yet, but they're
0:57:17.880000 - 0:57:21.600000::going to dominate the scene.
0:57:21.600000 - 0:57:25.600000::We got a bomb, the AMPTP.
0:57:25.600000 - 0:57:27.240000::Tomorrow come the Netflix.
0:57:27.240000 - 0:57:31.320000::I will be lighting myself on fire in front of Netflix.
0:57:31.320000 - 0:57:33.760000::And John is lighting the match.
0:57:33.760000 - 0:57:37.720000::And I'll be icing myself next to him freezing to death as well.
0:57:37.720000 - 0:57:38.760000::That's interesting.
0:57:38.760000 - 0:57:39.760000::That's interesting.
0:57:39.760000 - 0:57:40.360000::Oh, shit.
0:57:40.360000 - 0:57:42.280000::Do you know, John, about people burning themselves
0:57:42.280000 - 0:57:44.520000::on fires that even the most biggest, best Buddhist
0:57:44.520000 - 0:57:46.800000::monks that light themselves on fire?
0:57:46.800000 - 0:57:49.120000::And they'll be zen for a while, not screaming,
0:57:49.120000 - 0:57:51.440000::but they all end up eventually screaming.
0:57:51.440000 - 0:57:52.960000::Do they, like, run around?
0:57:52.960000 - 0:57:53.680000::There's that.
0:57:53.680000 - 0:57:55.600000::It has been one monk that has a screen.
0:57:55.600000 - 0:57:56.960000::If that happened, he's definitely not
0:57:56.960000 - 0:57:58::going to auto tune it, I bet.
0:57:58 - 0:58:00.720000::LAUGHTER
0:58:00.720000 - 0:58:01.640000::Shmoe yo ho.
0:58:01.640000 - 0:58:02.520000::Shmoe yo ho.
0:58:02.520000 - 0:58:05.280000::LAUGHTER
0:58:05.280000 - 0:58:06.440000::Wait, John, did you want to drink?
0:58:06.440000 - 0:58:07.800000::We have seven drinks up here.
0:58:07.800000 - 0:58:08.640000::I just saw eight drinks.
0:58:08.640000 - 0:58:09.640000::I'll have a beer.
0:58:09.640000 - 0:58:10.640000::Oh, beer.
0:58:10.640000 - 0:58:11.640000::We have something.
0:58:11.640000 - 0:58:13.120000::I'm the one who's drinking a beer.
0:58:13.120000 - 0:58:14.120000::Would you call him a delo?
0:58:14.120000 - 0:58:15.120000::A delo?
0:58:15.120000 - 0:58:16.120000::No, sir.
0:58:16.120000 - 0:58:17.120000::Yeah.
0:58:17.120000 - 0:58:18.120000::Japanese beer.
0:58:18.120000 - 0:58:19.120000::The coke is your own.
0:58:19.120000 - 0:58:20.120000::I'll have a support.
0:58:20.120000 - 0:58:21.120000::Oh, you are.
0:58:21.120000 - 0:58:22.120000::Thank you.
0:58:22.120000 - 0:58:23.120000::Who's drinking right now?
0:58:23.120000 - 0:58:24.120000::What just happened?
0:58:24.120000 - 0:58:26.120000::Seven people.
0:58:26.120000 - 0:58:27.120000::Good.
0:58:27.120000 - 0:58:27.960000::I have another question.
0:58:27.960000 - 0:58:28.480000::OK.
0:58:28.480000 - 0:58:30.440000::What is it?
0:58:30.440000 - 0:58:31.040000::Jack.
0:58:31.040000 - 0:58:32.440000::You?
0:58:32.440000 - 0:58:36.640000::How do you think SNL and fame has worked Sarah Sherman's mind?
0:58:36.640000 - 0:58:41.120000::And how would you avoid that if you were in the same position?
0:58:41.120000 - 0:58:43.160000::How will I avoid that when I am in that position?
0:58:49.160000 - 0:58:53.080000::I mean, it's changed her a lot to be completely honest.
0:58:53.080000 - 0:58:56.800000::She's been one of my best friends for many, many years.
0:58:56.800000 - 0:59:00.320000::I mean, when I had fleas in Chicago, I slept on her couch for two weeks.
0:59:00.320000 - 0:59:03.200000::I was living out of a whole food paper bag.
0:59:03.200000 - 0:59:05::I kept all my stuff in that.
0:59:05 - 0:59:08.200000::I remember you had a belt around your gym shorts.
0:59:08.200000 - 0:59:09.200000::What?
0:59:09.200000 - 0:59:10.200000::Showed a better house.
0:59:10.200000 - 0:59:13.640000::You weren't a belt around your gym shorts because you're trying to transport it easier.
0:59:13.640000 - 0:59:17.720000::No, because you can't keep with some heavy in your gym shorts.
0:59:17.720000 - 0:59:18.720000::I'm going to fuck you up.
0:59:18.720000 - 0:59:22.320000::Jack, you are the most jack thing I've ever heard of my life.
0:59:22.320000 - 0:59:23.920000::I had to get my bag out of that.
0:59:23.920000 - 0:59:26.160000::I was showering at export fitness.
0:59:26.160000 - 0:59:28.160000::This is not about me though.
0:59:28.160000 - 0:59:29.680000::This is about Sarah's house for a change.
0:59:29.680000 - 0:59:30.680000::You're a head of fleas, John.
0:59:30.680000 - 0:59:31.680000::But, bugs.
0:59:31.680000 - 0:59:32.680000::You mean fleas?
0:59:32.680000 - 0:59:33.680000::I've had skabies.
0:59:33.680000 - 0:59:34.680000::No.
0:59:34.680000 - 0:59:35.680000::Yeah, we know a couple.
0:59:35.680000 - 0:59:36.680000::We know a guy.
0:59:36.680000 - 0:59:37.680000::Really?
0:59:37.680000 - 0:59:38.680000::Yeah.
0:59:38.680000 - 0:59:39.680000::How did you get skabies?
0:59:39.680000 - 0:59:42.160000::Let's just say it was from sex.
0:59:42.160000 - 0:59:43.160000::Oh.
0:59:43.160000 - 0:59:45.160000::You had sex with a bug.
0:59:45.160000 - 0:59:46.160000::Oh my god.
0:59:46.160000 - 0:59:50.160000::Would you have sex with a sexual alien bug?
0:59:50.160000 - 0:59:51.160000::Give me a second.
0:59:51.160000 - 0:59:53.160000::I'm fucking thinking of the hormones.
0:59:53.160000 - 0:59:54.160000::Oh, yeah.
0:59:54.160000 - 0:59:55.160000::For sure.
0:59:55.160000 - 0:59:56.160000::Why not?
0:59:56.160000 - 0:59:57.160000::How long did this go?
0:59:57.160000 - 0:59:58.160000::I'm not sure.
0:59:58.160000 - 0:59:59.160000::I'm not sure.
0:59:59.160000 - 1:00:00.160000::I'm not sure.

1:00:00 - 1:00:02::Gaby's take to go away.
1:00:02 - 1:00:04::Kind of a while.
1:00:04 - 1:00:06::Like three weeks maybe?
1:00:06 - 1:00:07::Good God.
1:00:07 - 1:00:08::It was bad.
1:00:08 - 1:00:09::Do those itch?
1:00:09 - 1:00:10::Yes.
1:00:10 - 1:00:11::I don't know.
1:00:11 - 1:00:12::Yes.
1:00:12 - 1:00:13::Where was it?
1:00:13 - 1:00:14::Where, what do you mean?
1:00:14 - 1:00:16::I guess that's not how it works.
1:00:16 - 1:00:18::I didn't know it's gaby.
1:00:18 - 1:00:19::Where were they like?
1:00:19 - 1:00:20::I don't know, no, no, it's okay.
1:00:20 - 1:00:22::It's skin, it's outside, it's skin.
1:00:22 - 1:00:23::Two skin.
1:00:23 - 1:00:24::Oh, it is.
1:00:24 - 1:00:25::Someone's been...
1:00:25 - 1:00:26::That person has some...
1:00:26 - 1:00:28::They forgot they had bedbugs coming over.
1:00:28 - 1:00:30::A scabie just walked out.
1:00:30 - 1:00:32::I used to volunteer with an older man named Bernard.
1:00:32 - 1:00:36::And he passed.
1:00:36 - 1:00:38::Did he really?
1:00:38 - 1:00:39::He's gone.
1:00:39 - 1:00:40::I called him on Christmas.
1:00:40 - 1:00:41::He died.
1:00:41 - 1:00:42::He was funny.
1:00:42 - 1:00:44::But one time I took him out to breakfast.
1:00:44 - 1:00:47::And well, he would play harmonica for people.
1:00:47 - 1:00:50::And for the first song everybody was like loving it.
1:00:50 - 1:00:52::And then by song seven people were like this.
1:00:52 - 1:00:56::But one time I saw a bedbugs crawling on him.
1:00:56 - 1:00:58::He spilled out of his...
1:00:58 - 1:01:00::Just wanted to...
1:01:00 - 1:01:01::Oh, man.
1:01:01 - 1:01:03::I've never seen a bedbug.
1:01:03 - 1:01:05::There, well I'll show you after.
1:01:05 - 1:01:06::Okay.
1:01:06 - 1:01:07::Thank you.
1:01:07 - 1:01:09::Well, so to ask you the question,
1:01:09 - 1:01:12::basically we've gone all over the fucking country.
1:01:12 - 1:01:16::I used to live in a Minneapolis for my blah, blah, blah everywhere.
1:01:16 - 1:01:17::Portland.
1:01:17 - 1:01:18::And Sarah's flying.
1:01:18 - 1:01:19::First class.
1:01:19 - 1:01:21::And she makes me drive.
1:01:21 - 1:01:23::I actually don't even get to drive.
1:01:23 - 1:01:28::She makes me go on like a service where she's getting her merch shipped all around.
1:01:28 - 1:01:29::You know what I'm saying?
1:01:29 - 1:01:30::Because I have to ship the merch.
1:01:30 - 1:01:31::Yeah.
1:01:31 - 1:01:32::So I go in cargo.

1:01:53 - 1:01:54::Like a butter funer.
1:01:54 - 1:01:57::I would stab the fuck out of somebody with some John Early Knife.
1:01:57 - 1:02:00::The next Hollywood serial killer.
1:02:00 - 1:02:01::It's like all John Early merch.
1:02:01 - 1:02:02::I would stab all you.
1:02:02 - 1:02:04::I would stab all you with the John Early socks.
1:02:04 - 1:02:07::If I had a John Early Knife right now, I'd be slashing everybody left and right.
1:02:07 - 1:02:08::Are you kidding me?

1:02:46 - 1:02:47::You know, they...
1:02:47 - 1:02:48::And then they're gone.
1:02:48 - 1:02:49::They accident them.
1:02:49 - 1:02:51::Are you supposed to pull it out?
1:02:51 - 1:02:52::No.
1:02:52 - 1:02:53::Leave it in.
1:02:53 - 1:02:55::Well, it doesn't matter where it is.
1:02:55 - 1:02:56::What if it's in the heart?
1:02:56 - 1:02:58::What if it's the David Blaine thing?
1:02:58 - 1:02:59::If it's in the heart, you're...

1:03:37 - 1:03:39::Can everybody see the smoke in the air this whole time?
1:03:39 - 1:03:40::People are evading.
1:03:40 - 1:03:42::What's the fucking out-bars?

1:03:56 - 1:03:57::It's like dip.
1:03:57 - 1:03:58::But it's a little...
1:03:58 - 1:04:00::Tucker Carlson does it.
1:04:00 - 1:04:01::Ooh.
1:04:01 - 1:04:02::He's back.
1:04:02 - 1:04:04::He's on X.
1:04:04 - 1:04:05::Yeah.
1:04:05 - 1:04:06::He is on X.

1:04:20 - 1:04:23::And he lives in a penthouse now.
1:04:23 - 1:04:24::He looks amazing.
1:04:24 - 1:04:25::I know he does.
1:04:25 - 1:04:26::It's not his money.
1:04:26 - 1:04:28::It's his girlfriend's.
1:04:28 - 1:04:29::She's cool too.
1:04:29 - 1:04:30::She's awesome.
1:04:30 - 1:04:32::Is he truly, is he ripped?
1:04:32 - 1:04:33::No.
1:04:33 - 1:04:35::But he can do hell of pull-ups.
1:04:35 - 1:04:36::Wow.
1:04:36 - 1:04:37::He never took it.
1:04:37 - 1:04:38::Okay, is...

1:04:48 - 1:04:49::Oh, he's so...
1:04:49 - 1:04:50::Are you serious?
1:04:50 - 1:04:51::Are you real?
1:04:51 - 1:04:52::I'm serious.
1:04:52 - 1:04:54::That's crazy.
1:04:54 - 1:04:55::I'm shredded.
1:04:55 - 1:04:56::I don't know.
1:04:56 - 1:04:58::That is crazy.
1:04:58 - 1:05:00::Well, it's a mental illness thing.

1:05:00 - 1:05:01::Wow.
1:05:01 - 1:05:02::But he's cool.
1:05:02 - 1:05:03::So wait, what's the song, John?
1:05:03 - 1:05:05::What song did I work out to?
1:05:05 - 1:05:07::Or what's the genre, even?
1:05:07 - 1:05:09::Honestly, recently, I...
1:05:09 - 1:05:11::Okay, barely workout.
1:05:11 - 1:05:13::I want to be absolutely clear.
1:05:13 - 1:05:20::When I do, and music is involved, which is not often, recently, Isaac Hayes.
1:05:20 - 1:05:22::Oh, shout out to the audience.
1:05:22 - 1:05:23::I was sexual soul.
1:05:23 - 1:05:24::Yeah, yeah.
1:05:24 - 1:05:25::That's awesome.
1:05:25 - 1:05:26::It's really incredible.
1:05:26 - 1:05:27::I have to say.
1:05:27 - 1:05:31::Because the songs are really long, and they're really sexual.
1:05:31 - 1:05:34::They're like, they're like, for play, and then they like...
1:05:34 - 1:05:37::Like, and he like waits so long to get to the chorus.
1:05:37 - 1:05:40::You're like, you get to the first chorus, like, five minutes into every song.
1:05:40 - 1:05:41::Right.
1:05:41 - 1:05:42::And you're like...
1:05:42 - 1:05:44::And you're mentioned 480.
1:05:44 - 1:05:47::I put it up, that was fun.
1:05:47 - 1:05:50::It's like, literally 15 pounds.
1:05:50 - 1:05:52::I'm like...
1:05:52 - 1:05:54::It helps me.
1:05:54 - 1:05:57::Music is amazing.
1:05:57 - 1:06:00::I'll always say that, man.
1:06:00 - 1:06:03::That is something that you use a lot of music.
1:06:03 - 1:06:04::You love her, you think it's amazing.
1:06:04 - 1:06:05::Is it amazing, or is it, you know?
1:06:05 - 1:06:07::Last concert, you and Tujang?
1:06:07 - 1:06:08::Um...
1:06:08 - 1:06:10::I think...
1:06:10 - 1:06:11::She's not a Twain.
1:06:11 - 1:06:12::Oh, my...
1:06:12 - 1:06:13::That must have been incredible.
1:06:13 - 1:06:14::It was.
1:06:14 - 1:06:15::It was.
1:06:15 - 1:06:17::Where was it at?
1:06:17 - 1:06:19::I was in Nashville, and I was my sister.
1:06:19 - 1:06:20::She's fucking still.
1:06:20 - 1:06:21::Got it.
1:06:21 - 1:06:22::She's still got it.
1:06:22 - 1:06:23::She's... she's good.
1:06:23 - 1:06:24::She's great.
1:06:24 - 1:06:27::Did she put out new shit?
1:06:27 - 1:06:31::Yes, and there was a real, like, when she would do a new song, people were like...
1:06:31 - 1:06:32::Hot talks.
1:06:32 - 1:06:33::Yeah.
1:06:33 - 1:06:35::Oh, man.
1:06:35 - 1:06:38::I mean, I don't think she really cares, but...
1:06:38 - 1:06:41::She thinks she has over a million dollars.
1:06:41 - 1:06:43::No way.
1:06:43 - 1:06:45::I want to meet somebody.
1:06:45 - 1:06:46::No way.
1:06:46 - 1:06:49::Can you imagine that what that was look like?
1:06:49 - 1:06:50::Where would you keep it?
1:06:50 - 1:06:52::Where would you keep it all that?
1:06:52 - 1:06:56::You know, we're buttoned up on...
1:06:56 - 1:06:59::We got to ask John one more question or two.
1:06:59 - 1:07:03::Well, I wanted to ask you, you know, you're no stranger to having a close creative relationship
1:07:03 - 1:07:04::with people, right?
1:07:04 - 1:07:05::Yeah.
1:07:05 - 1:07:07::And that can be tough sometimes.
1:07:07 - 1:07:08::Yes.
1:07:08 - 1:07:11::And we three are in a creative relationship together.
1:07:11 - 1:07:12::And some creative...
1:07:12 - 1:07:14::Sometimes it's not working.
1:07:14 - 1:07:16::We're offstage, you know, and we're fighting.
1:07:16 - 1:07:17::Yeah.
1:07:17 - 1:07:19::So, do you have any advice for us as creative people that...
1:07:19 - 1:07:25::How do we stay amicable with each other and fight in the right way and, you know, still have love for each other?
1:07:25 - 1:07:31::Because it's a battle out there when you're creating so closely and intimately with someone.
1:07:31 - 1:07:32::Yeah.
1:07:32 - 1:07:33::Typically.
1:07:33 - 1:07:34::Yes.
1:07:34 - 1:07:35::Don't...
1:07:35 - 1:07:37::Like, okay.
1:07:37 - 1:07:38::Like, always try to restart.
1:07:38 - 1:07:42::Like, don't bring your baggage to every writing session.
1:07:42 - 1:07:43::That's good.
1:07:43 - 1:07:44::You know what I mean?
1:07:44 - 1:07:45::I love that.
1:07:45 - 1:07:47::Like, always, like, clean slate.
1:07:47 - 1:07:48::Yeah.
1:07:48 - 1:07:53::One of one of the guys had tried to have a section in your room with a girl that he met on a bus.
1:07:53 - 1:07:54::Well, I'm not me.
1:07:54 - 1:07:55::That's not me at all.
1:07:55 - 1:07:56::That's not me.
1:07:56 - 1:07:59::Oh, I'm not breaking that every recording.
1:07:59 - 1:08:01::That's what you thought about me.
1:08:01 - 1:08:04::Because that's where I draw the fucking line.
1:08:04 - 1:08:05::2015, man.
1:08:05 - 1:08:07::I just met a girl on a bus.
1:08:07 - 1:08:09::Can I use your room to have a book?
1:08:09 - 1:08:12::Can I tell this fucking story, please?
1:08:12 - 1:08:14::Can I tell it on my...
1:08:14 - 1:08:15::Please, please, please.
1:08:15 - 1:08:16::Well, when do we get kicked out of here?
1:08:16 - 1:08:17::We got hacked.
1:08:17 - 1:08:18::We got hacked.
1:08:18 - 1:08:19::You don't get kicked out at all.
1:08:19 - 1:08:20::Oh, shit.
1:08:20 - 1:08:21::This is about to go...
1:08:21 - 1:08:22::That's the dynasty way.
1:08:22 - 1:08:23::That's tax.
1:08:23 - 1:08:26::Okay, so basically...
1:08:26 - 1:08:27::Uh-huh.
1:08:27 - 1:08:31::Basically, I met a girl.
1:08:31 - 1:08:32::I was sleeping.
1:08:32 - 1:08:35::I was living on Eric's couch for a month or two.
1:08:35 - 1:08:36::Yeah.
1:08:36 - 1:08:40::And there was an opportunity that happened where I was on a bus.
1:08:40 - 1:08:41::And there was...
1:08:41 - 1:08:43::Two don't say like that.
1:08:43 - 1:08:44::Hey, man.
1:08:44 - 1:08:47::I mean, I love the connection.
1:08:47 - 1:08:52::And this girl that got on the bus was like...
1:08:52 - 1:08:57::She was like, once I get on this bus, like, I'm gonna fuck somebody on this bus.
1:08:57 - 1:08:58::Like, she was like...
1:08:58 - 1:09:02::And I just happened to be like that guy that was just like right there sitting...
1:09:02 - 1:09:03::I miss a pivotal thing.
1:09:03 - 1:09:05::What kind of bus are we talking about?
1:09:05 - 1:09:06::This city bus?
1:09:06 - 1:09:07::Chicago.
1:09:07 - 1:09:08::Chicago.
1:09:08 - 1:09:09::Yeah, which one?
1:09:09 - 1:09:10::Was it a diversity?
1:09:10 - 1:09:11::This was the...
1:09:11 - 1:09:14::This was on North Avenue.
1:09:14 - 1:09:15::Fourth and twos.
1:09:15 - 1:09:16::Okay, North Avenue.
1:09:16 - 1:09:17::Fourth and twos.
1:09:17 - 1:09:18::Anyways.
1:09:18 - 1:09:19::Yep.
1:09:19 - 1:09:22::I gotta go to the beach.
1:09:22 - 1:09:23::That's right.
1:09:23 - 1:09:24::Anyway.
1:09:24 - 1:09:28::Eric, I had previously asked Eric, you know what?
1:09:28 - 1:09:31::Hey, well, I'm like, you know, on your couch.
1:09:31 - 1:09:36::Like, what if I were to like, you know, bring someone home, like, could I just have your room and you sleep on the couch?
1:09:36 - 1:09:37::Yeah.
1:09:37 - 1:09:38::And Eric said, he said...
1:09:38 - 1:09:39::Yeah, of course.
1:09:39 - 1:09:40::He's so much at the time.
1:09:40 - 1:09:42::I was like, whatever you mean, man.
1:09:42 - 1:09:43::How many more?
1:09:43 - 1:09:44::Of course, you got a brother.
1:09:44 - 1:09:46::So Eric said that.
1:09:46 - 1:09:52::So as this was happening, I was like, oh shit, like, like I have a, you know, we could go back to my place.
