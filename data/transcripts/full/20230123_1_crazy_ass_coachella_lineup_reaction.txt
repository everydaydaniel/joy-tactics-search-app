0:01:12 - 0:01:15::We got to ask at this point, Nate.
0:01:15 - 0:01:18::I was about to say this is some fire like...
0:01:18 - 0:01:21::I mean people want to know how to use it.
0:01:21 - 0:01:23::Wait, Nate, can you sing low?
0:01:23 - 0:01:26::No, I have like the worst...
0:01:26 - 0:01:28::I have like one...
0:01:28 - 0:01:31::My range can't even be...
0:01:31 - 0:01:33::It's not even a range.
0:01:33 - 0:01:36::There's three notes that I think I can hit.
0:01:36 - 0:01:37::And that's it.
0:01:37 - 0:01:38::I don't have...
0:01:38 - 0:01:39::Always you can hit, Nate.
0:01:39 - 0:01:40::Three notes.
0:01:40 - 0:01:42::Hello.
0:01:42 - 0:01:43::That's low, dude.
0:01:43 - 0:01:44::That's low to it.
0:01:44 - 0:01:45::Is that pretty good?
0:01:45 - 0:01:46::But that hurt my voice.
0:01:46 - 0:01:48::I'm gonna feel that for the rest of the day.
0:01:48 - 0:01:50::That's gonna fuck me up permanently, dude.
0:01:50 - 0:01:52::That's gonna call...
0:01:53 - 0:01:55::That's gonna fuck my shit up.
0:01:55 - 0:01:57::That's a good way to go.
0:01:57 - 0:02:00::There was a guy in our...
0:02:00 - 0:02:01::In celebration.
0:02:01 - 0:02:04::And keep in mind, this is a small choir.
0:02:04 - 0:02:06::Only like 12 kids.
0:02:06 - 0:02:07::Selected.
0:02:07 - 0:02:09::His name was Alex Marr.
0:02:09 - 0:02:13::And he had the lowest voice I'd ever heard.
0:02:13 - 0:02:14::Oh.
0:02:14 - 0:02:15::He literally...
0:02:15 - 0:02:16::Yo, Eric.
0:02:16 - 0:02:17::What's up, man?
0:02:17 - 0:02:20::And so there would be like parts that they would add in
0:02:20 - 0:02:22::where it would be like, everybody goes quiet.
0:02:22 - 0:02:25::And then you just hear his low-ass voice.
0:02:25 - 0:02:29::And we were the type of choir that everybody had a microphone
0:02:29 - 0:02:31::at first sound songs.
0:02:31 - 0:02:34::No way.
0:02:34 - 0:02:37::Did I just was with a guy who cooked me
0:02:37 - 0:02:41::and some elderly people, some like a duck stew
0:02:41 - 0:02:43::or something in his house?
0:02:43 - 0:02:48::And he was like a six foot, seven, like 350 pound construction worker.
0:02:48 - 0:02:52::And he had the voice that was so low.
0:02:52 - 0:02:56::It literally sounded like he government in the room with me.
0:02:56 - 0:03:01::It sounded like somebody had stuffed somebody into like a bag or something.
0:03:01 - 0:03:03::Rrrr.
0:03:03 - 0:03:07::I wish I had a low voice like that.
0:03:07 - 0:03:09::So fucking badly.
0:03:09 - 0:03:11::Badly badly badly.
0:03:11 - 0:03:14::I hate my voice so much.
0:03:14 - 0:03:18::And there's anybody listening to this and it's like, God damn my hate.
0:03:18 - 0:03:19::Nates voice.
0:03:19 - 0:03:20::Yes, I do too.
0:03:20 - 0:03:21::Don't don't don't worry about it.
0:03:21 - 0:03:22::I do too.
0:03:22 - 0:03:23::Trust me.
0:03:23 - 0:03:24::The same goes for me.
0:03:24 - 0:03:25::I fucking go.
0:03:25 - 0:03:27::I love the fuck out of my voice.
0:03:27 - 0:03:29::And I love you guys' voice.
0:03:29 - 0:03:30::Self love.
0:03:30 - 0:03:31::Self love.
0:03:31 - 0:03:33::That's what we need a little bit more of.
0:03:33 - 0:03:35::You have an amazing voice, Nate.
0:03:35 - 0:03:36::What are you talking about?
0:03:36 - 0:03:39::You mean singing voice or speaking voice that you don't like?
0:03:39 - 0:03:40::Because they both sound good.
0:03:40 - 0:03:41::Well, I guess both.
0:03:41 - 0:03:43::Now that you bring singing into the mix.
0:03:43 - 0:03:49::But I'm just talking strictly speaking my speaking voice when I'm talking to you.
0:03:49 - 0:03:51::Nobody has a voice like yours, man.
0:03:51 - 0:03:52::Really?
0:03:52 - 0:03:53::It kind of sounds like real.
0:03:53 - 0:03:55::I do realize that.
0:03:55 - 0:04:01::Nate, say something commercial like McDonald's.
0:04:01 - 0:04:04::Get your big Mac today.
0:04:04 - 0:04:05::Gang.
0:04:05 - 0:04:08::You could be huge in certain countries, I think.
0:04:08 - 0:04:09::Oh, you put Turkish.
0:04:09 - 0:04:10::Turkish McDonald's.
0:04:10 - 0:04:11::I'm not a Turkish McDonald.
0:04:11 - 0:04:12::I'll be writers behind that.
0:04:12 - 0:04:15::I mean, Turkish McDonald's.
0:04:15 - 0:04:17::Nate, do a Turkish McDonald's thing, would you?
0:04:17 - 0:04:20::With an accent of Turkishness.
0:04:20 - 0:04:22::You don't even got to do that, actually.
0:04:22 - 0:04:24::Just give me your stuff.
0:04:24 - 0:04:25::The Turkey McDonald's.
0:04:25 - 0:04:28::What are you talking about?
0:04:28 - 0:04:29::A commercial for.
0:04:29 - 0:04:31::This type of turkeys.
0:04:31 - 0:04:32::Istanbul.
0:04:32 - 0:04:36::Do a do one for Istanbul's grand opening in McDonald's.
0:04:36 - 0:04:39::Do you think we're talking about McDonald's for Turkey?
0:04:39 - 0:04:40::No, no, no.
0:04:40 - 0:04:43::I was just confused on the prompt here.
0:04:43 - 0:04:44::All right.
0:04:44 - 0:04:46::So this is a McDonald's commercial.
0:04:46 - 0:04:49::The grand opening for a commercial.
0:04:49 - 0:04:50::A commercial.
0:04:50 - 0:04:51::Or McDonald's.
0:04:51 - 0:04:52::In Istanbul.
0:04:52 - 0:04:53::In Istanbul.
0:04:53 - 0:04:54::Commercial lies right now.
0:04:54 - 0:04:55::Okay, go, go.
0:04:55 - 0:04:56::Hey, yeah.

0:04:59 - 0:05:00::Yeah.

0:05:00 - 0:05:08.760000::It's the grand opening of I can't even what I can't do it. I don't even know what to say, dude
0:05:08.760000 - 0:05:13.840000::That's why we need some we need some I do need a copywriter behind me
0:05:13.840000 - 0:05:18.240000::No, this is a good premise for a commercial right is somebody starts reading the copy and they go
0:05:18.240000 - 0:05:20.240000::Welcome to turkey McDonald's
0:05:21.240000 - 0:05:25.440000::You know what I can't fucking do this shit my voice sucks man. I'm not gonna like me
0:05:25.680000 - 0:05:29.580000::That would be vulnerable you know what I'm saying. I think that would connect with a lot of people
0:05:29.580000 - 0:05:34.120000::You are the most vulnerable my most listened to song two years ago was a Turkish song
0:05:34.680000 - 0:05:38.180000::What was it called dad? I believe it was called den G den G
0:05:42.120000 - 0:05:48.760000::It sounds good off the bat. It's really good. You know speaking of music we have to get into the fucking
0:05:49.480000 - 0:05:53.640000::The Coachella lineup the coachella last release. Oh, yeah

0:06:28.560000 - 0:06:32.120000::If you're gonna take one thing away from this podcast know that
0:06:32.720000 - 0:06:36.960000::Here today we got Eric Ray Hill and he's drinking an a beer
0:06:36.960000 - 0:06:40.600000::I'm ordering them at the bars now at some points really
0:06:41.240000 - 0:06:48.560000::Well, I haven't done it recently, but you order a regular drink get a little buzz or order a double get a little buzz and
0:06:48.960000 - 0:06:53.040000::Chill on that and get a non-alcoholic beer than maybe a silencer than see how you feel
0:06:54 - 0:06:56::because
0:06:57.360000 - 0:07:03.840000::Drink in too many you know, I mean we're trying to at this age. I'm trying to re-evaluate my relationship with alcohol
0:07:04.480000 - 0:07:06.480000::You do adulting better than anyone I know
0:07:08 - 0:07:10::You really think that Jack
0:07:10.080000 - 0:07:14.440000::Yeah, I mean why do you why do you think I'm being so awesome at being an adult?
0:07:15.320000 - 0:07:18.720000::You put immense responsibilities on your back
0:07:19.400000 - 0:07:24::You've had sometimes too many you have a dog life a cat life
0:07:24.920000 - 0:07:30.120000::A human life also not just yours, but your partners as well correct because
0:07:30.920000 - 0:07:36.960000::These people would all perish without you rising to the occasion every day. I'm not I'm not ready to take that on
0:07:36.960000 - 0:07:42::I can't even to hardly get I think about myself like a pet. Oh fuck you could
0:07:42 - 0:07:47.920000::Here's the thing though dude, I mean, I don't have kids. So I mean that's the next step obviously
0:07:47.920000 - 0:07:53.400000::But you think you can't handle it. It's kind of you get them and you will it'll come you know
0:07:53.400000 - 0:08:00.960000::I mean you put the responsibility out there and you will rise to the occasion or you won't and then you'll learn how to do it after that first
0:08:00.960000 - 0:08:05.080000::Failure. Let me pass on some relationship advice if you're in a relationship
0:08:05.080000 - 0:08:11.480000::You're worried is my partner gonna continue their habits when we have a kid and adding a kid is actually like
0:08:12 - 0:08:15.800000::throwing throwing gasoline and fire onto your problems
0:08:16.320000 - 0:08:19.680000::No, they're gonna change have a kid and they'll change
0:08:21.400000 - 0:08:26.360000::Automatically, oh you're saying once the kid comes the person changes. Yeah, when a kid comes all the sudden
0:08:26.360000 - 0:08:30.480000::Oh, you stop having problems your life becomes perfect
0:08:31.640000 - 0:08:35.280000::After you have baby fever. I want a baby right now
0:08:35.640000 - 0:08:39.600000::What size I want a big big fat baby
0:08:40.600000 - 0:08:49.280000::Don't say that to you know, don't say that too close to the mic because the people listening might come might come back up into you in a way that oh
0:08:50.040000 - 0:08:56.720000::This is something that I was about to I saw a picture of someone that had a baby on Facebook and this baby was so skinny
0:08:56.720000 - 0:09:02.560000::Oh, and it wasn't I felt bad bringing up because I know some babies are too skinny and they have to be in the
0:09:03.600000 - 0:09:08.520000::Intensive care wherever but no this baby just was a thin little baby. I'm thinking that
0:09:09.600000 - 0:09:15.280000::I would I kind of want a big 10 pounds you want to be one of the baby to be a little chunky
0:09:15.280000 - 0:09:23.080000::You know that's how babies are supposed to be I mean can't you know I just can't help but judge a baby when I see one
0:09:23.640000 - 0:09:25.640000::For its looks
0:09:25.640000 - 0:09:27.640000::Oh, I have some well you just had a
0:09:29.080000 - 0:09:32.040000::Nice right? Yeah, I just had a nice and
0:09:33.240000 - 0:09:39.320000::Maybe you noticed this but my friend had a baby who's about to turn three in February and I
0:09:39.600000 - 0:09:41.920000::Feel like I had not been around babies my whole
0:09:43.680000 - 0:09:48.680000::Life like I really you know my no family friend said you know since I was a little kid
0:09:48.680000 - 0:09:55.480000::And so then we're now we're playing with her whatever she is so strong. I had no idea how muscular these
0:09:56.440000 - 0:10:00::She's all muscle. Yep, not crazy. The

0:10:00 - 0:10:04.080000::bones and even I had no idea how muscular a baby could be and they're the most
0:10:04.080000 - 0:10:08.520000::dangerous because they're muscular and flexible the ultimate combination so
0:10:08.520000 - 0:10:13.980000::if you see a baby your size run and baby the size of adults they would rip
0:10:13.980000 - 0:10:18.920000::your fucking head off and guess what they have no fucking respect for you they
0:10:18.920000 - 0:10:23.160000::have no respect for your property they don't give a fucking shit about our
0:10:23.160000 - 0:10:29.120000::civilized world they are just right little monsters and what is the opposite of
0:10:29.120000 - 0:10:33.520000::baby fever because I feel like I have that you really don't want a baby
0:10:33.520000 - 0:10:37.400000::name but you would be the most amazing dad that is kind of one of the most
0:10:37.400000 - 0:10:42.640000::no conflict because we would all agree that I would be probably one of the
0:10:42.640000 - 0:10:49.600000::top tier fathers father figures fathers what do you really do you know you
0:10:49.600000 - 0:10:54.600000::don't want a baby dude I think that I think unfortunately I'm going to be one
0:10:54.600000 - 0:11:01.280000::of those like 80 year olds with a with a three year old like I think I think I'm
0:11:01.280000 - 0:11:07.520000::going to decide I think I'm gonna decide way too late in life like fuck I
0:11:07.520000 - 0:11:12.520000::think I want kids but I'm going to be like 94 years old you know three days

0:11:28.520000 - 0:11:32.520000::that's punk rock yeah the lead singer three days grace is a hundred seven
0:11:32.520000 - 0:11:38.720000::incredible yeah you'll have a good we're all because I am imagining us three as
0:11:38.720000 - 0:11:44.560000::we'll be friends with us for our lives but raising kids I want us to plan when
0:11:44.560000 - 0:11:48.400000::we have kids kind of together you know I mean God willing and our partners
0:11:48.400000 - 0:11:56.400000::yeah we'll just go to our partners and say it's time three of us decided I
0:11:56.400000 - 0:12:01.360000::did this is gonna see them this is gonna blow your mind that I saw this is just I
0:12:01.360000 - 0:12:05.040000::feel like every medical thing that I get is from TikTok and it's kind of
0:12:05.040000 - 0:12:13.040000::poisoning my what I think of as medical factual information but this was a
0:12:13.040000 - 0:12:20.720000::TikTok that said the sperm that so the days leading up to when you you know
0:12:20.720000 - 0:12:28.920000::shoot the load that create the kid okay that sperm has if you had kind of a
0:12:28.920000 - 0:12:33.240000::tumultuous day like the day before or something you're kidding that is
0:12:33.240000 - 0:12:39.640000::transferred into the sperm the person into the person that you know that will
0:12:39.640000 - 0:12:46.680000::you know there's no way are you serious again I don't I want to say this was you

0:18:50.520000 - 0:18:53.520000::He has only put out, I think,
0:18:53.520000 - 0:18:54.920000::two albums.

0:18:58.360000 - 0:19:01.880000::Two albums, but they are so fucking good.
0:19:01.880000 - 0:19:04.120000::And he does not care about it.
0:19:04.120000 - 0:19:06.160000::And he's just like on feature sometimes.
0:19:06.160000 - 0:19:10.720000::I feel like he is living the kind of,
0:19:10.720000 - 0:19:13.400000::I don't know, the true artist's life.
0:19:13.400000 - 0:19:18.400000::He's not interested in, you know,
0:19:19.400000 - 0:19:22.600000::I guess the rat race of trying to put out
0:19:22.600000 - 0:19:23.800000::as much music as possible.
0:19:23.800000 - 0:19:26.680000::You see these people with fucking 30 songs on an album?
0:19:26.680000 - 0:19:29.600000::Like Frank Ocean has just got it going on.
0:19:29.600000 - 0:19:32.880000::And I feel like he has proved to me as a fan
0:19:32.880000 - 0:19:36.560000::that I will rock with him for life.
0:19:36.560000 - 0:19:41.560000::Okay, Nate, you just walked into Chipotle

0:20:12.880000 - 0:20:19.520000::Want to get in the mix because I know that Frank Ocean does not want me talking to him
0:20:20.240000 - 0:20:26.640000::What's lever? No, that's not what he does not want to have a conversation with me. He does
0:20:26.640000 - 0:20:28.640000::Okay, wait
0:20:28.640000 - 0:20:34.560000::Okay, well then you see him what he's googling something he's googling why won't anybody talk to me in public?

0:24:03.040000 - 0:24:07.680000::Muah when you see freaking um Amy Schumer and
0:24:07.680000 - 0:24:09.680000::Uh
0:24:09.680000 - 0:24:11.680000::Deantwood
0:24:12.160000 - 0:24:15.400000::Diet word around yeah, I can cruise

0:24:21.360000 - 0:24:26.560000::Imagine this because you know how do you hand word whatever their lyrics don't mean anything they just sound crazy, right?
0:24:26.560000 - 0:24:28.560000::Is that true? They don't mean anything?
0:24:29.440000 - 0:24:34.160000::Sexy boy. No, that means nothing, but if you put someone with a little is that cuz you
0:24:35.080000 - 0:24:44.680000::Creativity with words behind lyrics, okay, I'm gonna play and it's Amy Schumer and she's written all of their lyrics. Oh my god
0:24:45.560000 - 0:24:52.460000::Because Amy Schumer all the cuz because Amy Schumer right she writes funny shit right we're all laughing
0:24:52.760000 - 0:24:53.920000::but
0:24:53.920000 - 0:24:59.660000::She also can write some serious shit so and when you ask a comedian to be writing something serious

0:25:00 - 0:25:05::Get ready for one of the most serious things you've ever experienced.
0:25:05 - 0:25:10::Yeah, there's a reason why you know we have these Jordan Peels of the world.
0:25:10 - 0:25:16::We have these comedians who make the leap into something that's not comedy.
0:25:16 - 0:25:21::And it's weird because each one of the people, every time a comedian takes that little leap,
0:25:21 - 0:25:26::they do it better than the people that we're doing in their whole fucking life.
0:25:26 - 0:25:36::And why is that? Because we have a sort of observation of humanity that a lot of people can't even access in their brains.
0:25:36 - 0:25:41::Some people let themselves and they haven't gone through enough trauma.
0:25:41 - 0:25:46::And when me and Eric put out somewhere 2021 and it got 800 videos.
0:25:46 - 0:25:47::Literally YouTube.
0:25:47 - 0:25:49::Two. It's like 2000 now.
0:25:49 - 0:25:57::Well, I had to cut it off because I could tell this is going to have, you know, globalized reprocussions.
0:25:57 - 0:25:59::And so I shut it down early.
0:25:59 - 0:26:07::I want to say this really quick about comedians being because, right, because everybody puts a comedian in a box like,
0:26:07 - 0:26:10::oh, it's Jim Carey, he's only going to be on Living Coal.
0:26:10 - 0:26:12::Or he could never do it more serious.
0:26:12 - 0:26:17::Well, listen to this. There's no freedom quite like the freedom of being constantly underestimated.
0:26:17 - 0:26:26::Oh, my God. There's no pain worse than sympathy and deaf lingers on every word.
0:26:26 - 0:26:29::There's no pain worse than sympathy.
0:26:29 - 0:26:33::These words are like music to my ears right now.
0:26:33 - 0:26:35::Can you guys hear this?
0:26:35 - 0:26:40::No, I don't think so. You playing it? Are you playing something?
0:26:40 - 0:26:42::I'm not hearing a damn thing.
0:26:42 - 0:26:44::I am. How do I make my audio go to you?
0:26:44 - 0:26:48::Oh, my God. What?
0:26:48 - 0:26:56::That code that says there's no freedom like quite like the freedom of being constantly underestimated.
0:26:56 - 0:26:59::I was like, that shit sounds familiar.
0:26:59 - 0:27:01::I was like, that shit sounds really familiar.
0:27:01 - 0:27:05::And yet it's from a book I just read.
0:27:05 - 0:27:09::Oh, the lies of La Clamora by Scott Lynch.
0:27:09 - 0:27:12::I'm like, I knew this for some reason.
0:27:12 - 0:27:18::So you're finding out the things that you're retention rate. Yeah, ability quite.
0:27:18 - 0:27:21::I'm becoming the most amazing reader.
0:27:21 - 0:27:22::That is incredible.
0:27:22 - 0:27:25::Sorry, I can't you off, Jack. You want to play some music?
0:27:25 - 0:27:27::Well, yeah, we're gonna play a jack.

0:27:29 - 0:27:32::Well, and be careful with the copyright, dude.
0:27:32 - 0:27:38::Oh, no, I'd be be knowing that I googled, um, royalty free.
0:27:38 - 0:27:41::Wait, what were we talking about just before this?
0:27:41 - 0:27:43::We were talking about Coach.
0:27:43 - 0:27:49::So we should probably send a message out to everybody, because someone dies at every single one of these festivals.
0:27:49 - 0:27:50::Right?
0:27:50 - 0:27:52::Yeah, a couple people.
0:27:52 - 0:27:54::Wait, what is this Jack?
0:27:54 - 0:27:55::Can you hear that?
0:27:55 - 0:27:57::I can't hear it here at damn thing.
0:27:57 - 0:27:58::I can't hear it.
0:27:58 - 0:27:59::Well, the free.
0:27:59 - 0:28:00::I can't hear it at damn thing.

0:28:43 - 0:28:52::Artists, anybody who's hustling, nobody's hustling harder than the fucking 19 year old who wants to be the next murder beats.

0:29:13 - 0:29:14::Everybody gets worth.
0:29:14 - 0:29:15::What is that saying?
0:29:15 - 0:29:19::Everybody, everybody gets everybody.

0:35:17.840000 - 0:35:21.680000::This is about to improve by times a hundred.
0:35:21.680000 - 0:35:27.280000::And you're going to fall back way back in class, so to speak, if you don't listen to this,
0:35:27.280000 - 0:35:29.800000::because you're going to be like a fool when everyone's walking around.
0:35:29.800000 - 0:35:31.400000::This is basically the new books.
0:35:31.400000 - 0:35:33.240000::And all these podcasts are narrative.
0:35:33.240000 - 0:35:35::So you have to start an episode one.
0:35:35 - 0:35:39.200000::And for years from now, you're going to have to listen to literally every single episode
0:35:39.200000 - 0:35:41.600000::is going to kind of expand on the next one.
0:35:41.600000 - 0:35:44.200000::And it's going to be, it's not going to seem like a storyline.
0:35:44.200000 - 0:35:45.200000::Right.
0:35:45.200000 - 0:35:46.200000::But it actually is.
0:35:46.200000 - 0:35:48.200000::And you're going to, just like CNN.
0:35:48.200000 - 0:35:49.200000::Yeah.
0:35:49.200000 - 0:35:51.200000::Wait, have you guys thought about this, right?
0:35:51.200000 - 0:35:55.520000::Because we're in like the new rise in class of whatever comedians is so awesome.
0:35:55.520000 - 0:35:59.760000::And so these people that we think are just our regular friends right now, in ten years,
0:35:59.760000 - 0:36:02.360000::it'll be like, oh, fuck you knew them.
0:36:02.360000 - 0:36:05.200000::I'm like, yeah, I'm more for dinner every night.
0:36:05.200000 - 0:36:09.760000::Or like, yeah, I went to bars with them, got fucked up to even think about fame.
0:36:09.760000 - 0:36:15.200000::Until like we know, right, panic attack up in there, all up in the face.
0:36:15.200000 - 0:36:16.200000::Yeah.
0:36:16.200000 - 0:36:23.080000::But we, and we already know some celebrities that we can't really talk about.
0:36:23.080000 - 0:36:27.240000::But the thing is, we know a lot of future celebrities.
0:36:27.240000 - 0:36:30.240000::Maybe celebrities have friends in high and low places.
0:36:30.240000 - 0:36:33.040000::So if anybody wants to fuck with us, don't wait.
0:36:33.040000 - 0:36:34.640000::Can I say something real quick?
0:36:34.640000 - 0:36:35.640000::Please.
0:36:35.640000 - 0:36:36.640000::Okay.
0:36:36.640000 - 0:36:38.240000::So the, all right.
0:36:38.240000 - 0:36:42.560000::So we're talking about, you know, obviously the three of us are going to be kind of in
0:36:42.560000 - 0:36:46.880000::the global zeitgeist coming up very sooner than you think.
0:36:46.880000 - 0:36:47.880000::Quick, quickly.
0:36:47.880000 - 0:36:50.440000::We're already in regional zeitgeists.
0:36:50.440000 - 0:36:55.480000::We are already very well known, but it's about to get on a kind of global scale.
0:36:56.480000 - 0:37:06.040000::And you always at, okay, so I heard this once that an ex-girlfriend of Barack Obama's,
0:37:06.040000 - 0:37:13.120000::she said, you know, when she was dating Barack in his early 20s or whatever, he was like,
0:37:13.120000 - 0:37:16.760000::I'm going to be the fucking president, you know what I'm saying?
0:37:16.760000 - 0:37:17.760000::Did he really?
0:37:17.760000 - 0:37:19.280000::And he knew that shit.
0:37:19.280000 - 0:37:20.280000::Fucking president.
0:37:20.280000 - 0:37:24.680000::And I think I'm putting him exactly like I said that one time.
0:37:24.680000 - 0:37:29.360000::And he knew what the fuck was, was going to happen in his life, okay?
0:37:29.360000 - 0:37:34.040000::So a lot of, a lot of people before they're big, they already know what's going to happen.
0:37:34.040000 - 0:37:35.040000::And guess what?
0:37:35.040000 - 0:37:39.040000::I knew that shit since I was fucking born.
0:37:39.040000 - 0:37:44.440000::And I had this thought while I was not working at my day job at cars.com when I was working
0:37:44.440000 - 0:37:45.440000::in my 20s.
0:37:45.440000 - 0:37:51.720000::And I had this fantasy of, I don't want to work here, but maybe I could, you know, I would
0:37:51.720000 - 0:37:54.640000::never, I would, I never did this, but I was kicking around this, this, this.
0:37:54.640000 - 0:38:02.680000::Crazy kind of idea to pitch, get a meeting with the CEO and tell him, you know, look, I'm
0:38:02.680000 - 0:38:06.160000::going to be so fucking big in the future.
0:38:06.160000 - 0:38:10.800000::It might take, you know, five years, it might take 40 years.
0:38:10.800000 - 0:38:15.400000::But at some point, I'm going to be in the conversation.
0:38:15.400000 - 0:38:19.440000::Here's a PowerPoint presentation to prove that, you know what I'm saying?
0:38:19.440000 - 0:38:22.680000::And I will do a free commercial for you guys at that point.
0:38:22.680000 - 0:38:28.240000::But all you have to do is fund my life until that point.
0:38:28.240000 - 0:38:30.120000::And it would really feel that night.
0:38:30.120000 - 0:38:31.120000::I did.
0:38:31.120000 - 0:38:34.840000::I was like, why, I was kind of in like just a really fucking mode.
0:38:34.840000 - 0:38:38.520000::And I was just daydreaming of like, how the fuck do I get out of this fucking job?
0:38:38.520000 - 0:38:42.680000::How do I not work here and work a job ever again?
0:38:42.680000 - 0:38:44::Like could that be a possibility?
0:38:44 - 0:38:47.640000::And so you would be the spokesman for free if they just bankrolled you until you began
0:38:47.640000 - 0:38:48.640000::things.
0:38:48.640000 - 0:38:49.640000::Exactly.
0:38:49.640000 - 0:38:50.640000::Exactly.
0:38:50.640000 - 0:38:51.640000::I feel like that's awesome.
0:38:51.640000 - 0:38:54.760000::That's got to be the first scene of your of your bio pick.
0:38:54.760000 - 0:38:56.560000::Where they go.
0:38:56.560000 - 0:38:58.280000::It's you you're sitting there.
0:38:58.280000 - 0:39:02.760000::You're eating crispy, you know, you're eating Dunkin' Donuts, bacon, egg and cheese on
0:39:02.760000 - 0:39:04.080000::croissant.
0:39:04.080000 - 0:39:12.040000::And then oh, flat crazy flashes of, uh, at boats blowing up and you're in a private jet
0:39:12.040000 - 0:39:13.840000::and you can fake teeth.
0:39:13.840000 - 0:39:15.680000::Crazy montage of you with those.
0:39:15.680000 - 0:39:16.680000::Of course.
0:39:16.680000 - 0:39:17.680000::Crazy teeth.
0:39:17.680000 - 0:39:20.080000::Hey, what if you're getting venerers and all of a sudden there was an earthquake when
0:39:20.080000 - 0:39:22.320000::you were in the transition where they shaved your teeth down?
0:39:22.320000 - 0:39:23.320000::Oh, right.
0:39:23.320000 - 0:39:26.360000::So everybody had to go outside and they couldn't, couldn't return.
0:39:26.360000 - 0:39:30.200000::Oh, wait, I thought you were going to say they kind of sliced into it.
0:39:30.200000 - 0:39:31.720000::Oh, they sliced them?
0:39:31.720000 - 0:39:34.560000::Because you've seen what happens to people with little teeth when they get venerers,
0:39:34.560000 - 0:39:35.560000::right?
0:39:35.560000 - 0:39:36.560000::You've seen.
0:39:36.560000 - 0:39:37.560000::That's what I'm saying.
0:39:37.560000 - 0:39:38.560000::They have shaved into nubs, Nate.
0:39:38.560000 - 0:39:39.560000::Ooh, I don't like that.
0:39:39.560000 - 0:39:40.560000::Have you heard of this?
0:39:40.560000 - 0:39:41.560000::Yes, of course.
0:39:41.560000 - 0:39:42.560000::It looks scary.
0:39:42.560000 - 0:39:45.160000::It looks like little tick-tax for teeth.
0:39:45.160000 - 0:39:46.160000::Yeah.
0:39:46.160000 - 0:39:47.160000::Tick-tax.
0:39:47.160000 - 0:39:48.560000::And that's just the root because you go any deeper than that.
0:39:48.560000 - 0:39:49.560000::You're hitting the nerve root.
0:39:49.560000 - 0:39:52.960000::Oh, I don't have teeth and nerves.
0:39:52.960000 - 0:39:53.960000::You don't.

0:44:37.200000 - 0:44:42.480000::I just heard that mushrooms for the only safe drug is something bad that can happen. Why did I hear that who told me that?
0:44:42.640000 - 0:44:44.640000::What about what about they
0:44:45.280000 - 0:44:49.760000::Because my fears this yeah, I have there's a history of schizophrenia in my family
0:44:50.480000 - 0:44:55.600000::That's not gonna be possible. It could reignite if I've never had it. It could unleash
0:44:56.560000 - 0:44:59.360000::schizophrenia. Oh my god. That is fun.

0:45:00 - 0:45:02.260000::That is scary right here.
0:45:02.260000 - 0:45:04.540000::Here's the ass motherfucking shit.
0:45:04.540000 - 0:45:07.740000::Oh, I don't worry that way sometimes when I'm just hungry.
0:45:07.740000 - 0:45:09.740000::I'm like I haven't eaten or drinking anything today.
0:45:09.740000 - 0:45:13.540000::I feel like this I might never come back mentally from where I'm at station debt currently.
0:45:13.540000 - 0:45:15.740000::Take magnesium Jack.
0:45:15.740000 - 0:45:17.740000::Magnesium is in seeds.
0:45:17.740000 - 0:45:18.740000::Is that right?
0:45:18.740000 - 0:45:21.140000::Take, no, there's no magnesium ever in that.
0:45:21.140000 - 0:45:22.780000::There's found you have to take a supple.
0:45:22.780000 - 0:45:24.780000::It has to be in a pill.
0:45:24.780000 - 0:45:25.780000::Why is it gotta be a pill?
0:45:25.780000 - 0:45:27.780000::Why do pills have to be shaped like that too?
0:45:28.340000 - 0:45:32.780000::These pills are dangerously big and I'll swallow them to it once.
0:45:32.780000 - 0:45:34.780000::These pills.
0:45:34.780000 - 0:45:37.780000::Wait, this is probably the most important thing.
0:45:37.780000 - 0:45:38.780000::You take vitamin D right?
0:45:38.780000 - 0:45:39.780000::What's that Eric?
0:45:39.780000 - 0:45:47.260000::I only take magnesium and maybe it's because of my CPAP but I'm feeling so fucking good
0:45:47.260000 - 0:45:48.260000::lately.
0:45:48.260000 - 0:45:49.260000::You can tell right?
0:45:49.260000 - 0:45:50.260000::You can see it.
0:45:50.260000 - 0:45:51.260000::Night and day, right?
0:45:51.260000 - 0:45:52.260000::Night and day.
0:45:52.260000 - 0:45:53.260000::Are you serious?
0:45:53.260000 - 0:45:54.260000::Night and fucking day dude.
0:45:54.260000 - 0:45:55.260000::I've never seen you so happy.
0:45:55.260000 - 0:45:56.260000::I'm seeing more energy.
0:45:56.260000 - 0:45:57.260000::I'm seeing more energy.
0:45:57.260000 - 0:45:59.260000::I'm seeing more vibrance.
0:45:59.260000 - 0:46:04.180000::I'm not taking nap at 11 a.m. and at 4 p.m. every day.
0:46:04.180000 - 0:46:07.340000::Let me tell you this is pre-stative kind of the hospital.
0:46:07.340000 - 0:46:08.340000::You will.
0:46:08.340000 - 0:46:09.340000::Pre-C-PAP.
0:46:09.340000 - 0:46:12.260000::Eric gives me a lot of rides around the city.
0:46:12.260000 - 0:46:13.780000::He's got an awesome car.
0:46:13.780000 - 0:46:15.580000::And he's the pre-C-PAP.
0:46:15.580000 - 0:46:18.700000::He picks me up and he goes, hey man, how are you dude?
0:46:18.700000 - 0:46:23.940000::I feel like for some reason I feel like I am watching my own reality through lens
0:46:23.940000 - 0:46:29.060000::and the traffic lights are freaking me out and the sunset is making me feel the color
0:46:29.060000 - 0:46:34.740000::of the sun right now is making me think that I maybe can't balance on the sidewalk and
0:46:34.740000 - 0:46:36.860000::I go, you know, that's all right.
0:46:36.860000 - 0:46:41.940000::We're going to get through this man and in my head I was thinking this might be a cyanara
0:46:41.940000 - 0:46:45.380000::suck of bugs, bunny, barium and the woods type of moment where I'm going to have to take
0:46:45.380000 - 0:46:47.940000::over ownership of his whole life and his car.
0:46:47.940000 - 0:46:50.220000::And then I had some seriously.
0:46:50.220000 - 0:46:54.900000::I thought you might have had a new type of tumor that goes top to bottom of your whole
0:46:54.900000 - 0:46:55.900000::back.
0:46:55.900000 - 0:47:03.460000::Oh, you know how you hear about a, you know, somebody that is in their early 30s and they
0:47:03.460000 - 0:47:04.460000::suffer a heart attack.
0:47:04.460000 - 0:47:10.300000::There's always somebody who's younger than they should be getting a disease or some type
0:47:10.300000 - 0:47:12.940000::of illness when they're younger than they should be.
0:47:12.940000 - 0:47:14.540000::And you're like, damn, that happened to this.
0:47:14.540000 - 0:47:16.540000::They were only, they were only fucking 20s.
0:47:16.540000 - 0:47:18.820000::And you guys both thought that was going to be me.
0:47:18.820000 - 0:47:23.900000::I think you were a day away from that being.
0:47:23.900000 - 0:47:28.540000::Car, cardiac arrest, literally took them out.
0:47:28.540000 - 0:47:32.060000::But then I got, but then to inform everyone, people don't know.
0:47:32.060000 - 0:47:34.380000::I got a CPAP machine.
0:47:34.380000 - 0:47:37.180000::I got a seat patch changing my life.
0:47:37.180000 - 0:47:39.180000::You know what I mean?
0:47:39.180000 - 0:47:40.180000::The air.
0:47:40.180000 - 0:47:41.180000::Free style rap.
0:47:41.180000 - 0:47:43.180000::CPAP rap rap.
0:47:43.180000 - 0:47:44.180000::CPAP tapes.
0:47:44.180000 - 0:47:50.060000::Eric, yeah, Eric puts out a music album to express how happy he is now.
0:47:50.060000 - 0:47:51.540000::He has a CPAP machine.
0:47:51.540000 - 0:47:56.260000::I might do so, but then you're saying that I got on the machine and learn what happened
0:47:56.260000 - 0:47:57.260000::to me, Jay.
0:47:57.260000 - 0:48:06.460000::Low and behold, you can look, you can go outside after 4 30 p.m. and have a completely
0:48:06.460000 - 0:48:08.500000::regular conversation.
0:48:08.500000 - 0:48:09.660000::That's very true.
0:48:09.660000 - 0:48:14.540000::You can go hang out at the bar and have a conversation, a discussion about how can you
0:48:14.540000 - 0:48:19.660000::be so sure that you're in control of your own body at any given moment.
0:48:19.660000 - 0:48:26.900000::I really could not look into like headlights or like traffic signals.
0:48:26.900000 - 0:48:27.900000::It was like blind.
0:48:27.900000 - 0:48:31.860000::I want to, I remember thinking like, is it fucked up to get sunglasses for nighttime?
0:48:31.860000 - 0:48:33.340000::Oh my God.
0:48:33.340000 - 0:48:37.380000::And then there's a song about that.
0:48:37.380000 - 0:48:42.620000::And then I got these damn, I'm sleeping right now that I got my sleep apnea being treated
0:48:42.620000 - 0:48:46.300000::by the CPAP machine and that affects my eyes.
0:48:46.300000 - 0:48:47.300000::You see what I'm saying?
0:48:47.300000 - 0:48:52.700000::The body is so interconnected in ways that they don't want us to even know about.
0:48:52.700000 - 0:48:57.140000::Yep, because there's nerves in your toe that you can press to fix your posture.
0:48:57.140000 - 0:49:01.180000::There's a lot of little secret buttons all around the body.
0:49:01.180000 - 0:49:05.100000::And this is, you know, Eastern medicine I think does understand that better.
0:49:06.100000 - 0:49:08.020000::And what did he do stop Eastern medicine?
0:49:08.020000 - 0:49:09.380000::I mean like Chinese medicine.
0:49:09.380000 - 0:49:13.380000::No, I'm saying what, you know, that's the, that's according to the current organization
0:49:13.380000 - 0:49:15.660000::of how the poles of the earth work.
0:49:15.660000 - 0:49:17.500000::There will be no directions at some point.
0:49:17.500000 - 0:49:19.500000::There will be no east, west, north, south.
0:49:19.500000 - 0:49:23.220000::It'll just be world because there's going to be another one that, because north, south,
0:49:23.220000 - 0:49:26.540000::east, west covers all these directions, but what about through the mansion?
0:49:26.540000 - 0:49:30.420000::Oh, it needs to be, well, that's going to be what is it?
0:49:30.420000 - 0:49:32.420000::Those directions don't exist yet.
0:49:32.420000 - 0:49:36.700000::Into the earth, you know, new directions just drop.
0:49:36.700000 - 0:49:37.700000::New directions just drop.
0:49:37.700000 - 0:49:38.700000::New directions.
0:49:38.700000 - 0:49:40.780000::Yeah, we got a new direction.
0:49:40.780000 - 0:49:41.780000::Yeah, we got a new direction.
0:49:41.780000 - 0:49:42.780000::West and east.
0:49:42.780000 - 0:49:43.780000::That's a good point.
0:49:43.780000 - 0:49:44.780000::Go through some.
0:49:44.780000 - 0:49:47.260000::Okay, I want to go into the earth.
0:49:47.260000 - 0:49:48.260000::Where is that?
