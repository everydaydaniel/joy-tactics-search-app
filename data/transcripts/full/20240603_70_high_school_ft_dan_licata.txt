0:01:19 - 0:01:20::Be careful.
0:01:20 - 0:01:23::Those monastery teachers and the staff there are violent.
0:01:23 - 0:01:26::And they will be in your DMs right now.
0:01:26 - 0:01:29::I've already been down this road.
0:01:29 - 0:01:31::We have a highly educated...
0:01:31 - 0:01:33::...listener ship.

0:01:41 - 0:01:43::Did they kick you out or can you keep doing it?
0:01:43 - 0:01:45::I think you could keep doing it.
0:01:45 - 0:01:48::And I think anyone can start one and there's no rules.
0:01:48 - 0:01:50::And I think...
0:01:50 - 0:01:52::Maybe that'll be my next project.
0:01:52 - 0:01:55::I'm opening my own Monosori school.
0:01:55 - 0:01:56::And it's a Italian.

0:01:57 - 0:01:58::Montessori?
0:01:58 - 0:02:00::I thought it was Jewish.

0:02:02 - 0:02:04::Well, it has a valid end.
0:02:04 - 0:02:07::Anything with a valid end, like Lakata Verone.

0:02:19 - 0:02:21::I can't imagine that.
0:02:21 - 0:02:24::Derbiking the morning, two a day, Derbikes.
0:02:24 - 0:02:26::And then painball, fucking lunch.
0:02:26 - 0:02:28::You make a Jewish exchange course.
0:02:28 - 0:02:29::Winged army.
0:02:29 - 0:02:31::Right, they're underrepresented.
0:02:31 - 0:02:34::Do you see somebody coming flying out towards your head on a motorcycle,
0:02:34 - 0:02:37::listening to whatever it's called?

0:03:04 - 0:03:06::Somebody in an NFL helmet with the...
0:03:06 - 0:03:08::We need to hit someone in the...
0:03:08 - 0:03:09::In the NFL.
0:03:09 - 0:03:11::That would be hard.
0:03:11 - 0:03:13::We need, yeah.
0:03:13 - 0:03:16::Jamie did fact check this shit for us.
0:03:16 - 0:03:17::Oh yeah.
0:03:17 - 0:03:20::The Rogan staff is working double time with me.
0:03:20 - 0:03:23::We need a producer that we can clown on.
0:03:23 - 0:03:24::I know.
0:03:24 - 0:03:25::You know what I'm saying?
0:03:25 - 0:03:27::It was a little bit like a lot of...
0:03:27 - 0:03:29::A tension towards the area that we...
0:03:29 - 0:03:33::I feel like we tend to put some of that energy on you.
0:03:33 - 0:03:34::Yeah.
0:03:34 - 0:03:36::I don't know if you know this, Dan,
0:03:36 - 0:03:40::but I would say the most bullied one out of all three of us.
0:03:40 - 0:03:41::Yeah.
0:03:41 - 0:03:44::And yet the most successful is quite curious.
0:03:44 - 0:03:45::It's quite interesting.
0:03:45 - 0:03:46::Well, they're...
0:03:46 - 0:03:48::They're punching up is what they're doing.
0:03:48 - 0:03:49::I know, bro.
0:03:49 - 0:03:50::But I'm sensitive down there.
0:03:50 - 0:03:51::You know what I'm saying?
0:03:51 - 0:03:52::Ethicality.
0:03:52 - 0:03:53::Yeah.
0:03:53 - 0:03:56::By the way, we have to say that Dan
0:03:56 - 0:03:57::look how it just dropped.
0:03:57 - 0:03:58::Right.
0:03:58 - 0:03:59::And stand up special.
0:03:59 - 0:04:01::It's on YouTube.
0:04:01 - 0:04:02::Right fucking now.
0:04:02 - 0:04:07::I just want to say that if you want to just dip out of this podcast right now,
0:04:07 - 0:04:09::just exit out right now.
0:04:09 - 0:04:10::Mm hmm.
0:04:10 - 0:04:12::To exit out, just go to YouTube.
0:04:12 - 0:04:13::Don't even listen to this podcast.
0:04:13 - 0:04:16::Just go to YouTube and watch Dan look how to spit.
0:04:16 - 0:04:17::I'm not going to be mad.
0:04:17 - 0:04:19::I'm not going to be mad once in a bit.
0:04:19 - 0:04:20::Right.
0:04:20 - 0:04:23::That our deliciousness just drops off for this episode.
0:04:23 - 0:04:27::If we're going to transfer that viewership to Dan look how does that's all I care about right now.
0:04:27 - 0:04:28::Yeah.
0:04:28 - 0:04:29::To be frankly honest.
0:04:29 - 0:04:30::Right.
0:04:30 - 0:04:31::And it's incredible.
0:04:31 - 0:04:35::You did a special, a stand up special that no one's ever done before.
0:04:36 - 0:04:41::You did a special in front of all 15 year old boys.
0:04:41 - 0:04:42::Correct.
0:04:42 - 0:04:43::At your old high school.
0:04:43 - 0:04:44::At my old high school in Buffalo.
0:04:44 - 0:04:45::Yeah.
0:04:45 - 0:04:49::Which um, it's kind of weird that I did that honestly.
0:04:49 - 0:04:50::Honestly.
0:04:50 - 0:04:52::It's quite strange.
0:04:52 - 0:04:54::What makes you believe this?
0:04:54 - 0:05:00::Just based on like, I think it's a good litmus test anytime.

0:05:00 - 0:05:02.280000::I would tell someone like the concept for the special.
0:05:02.280000 - 0:05:05.400000::I feel like guys like us are like hell yeah,
0:05:05.400000 - 0:05:08.440000::when they hear the concept, but there were a couple of times
0:05:08.440000 - 0:05:11.240000::when I would tell people the concept and they go, huh.
0:05:11.240000 - 0:05:12.800000::So why do you want to do that?
0:05:12.800000 - 0:05:14.320000::And I'm like, all right.
0:05:14.320000 - 0:05:16.840000::Special is not for you.
0:05:16.840000 - 0:05:17.440000::Right.
0:05:17.440000 - 0:05:19.080000::It's for the real ones.
0:05:19.080000 - 0:05:22.440000::Did you get intimidated with the first time
0:05:22.440000 - 0:05:23.480000::you've met all the boys?
0:05:23.480000 - 0:05:24.360000::Did you meet them all?
0:05:24.360000 - 0:05:26.840000::But did you like talk to them before you went on?
0:05:26.840000 - 0:05:28.480000::Or was it fresh?
0:05:29.440000 - 0:05:32.560000::I kind of went out on stage and just introduced myself.
0:05:32.560000 - 0:05:33.400000::Yeah.
0:05:33.400000 - 0:05:35.680000::I told them like, if you guys do a good job,
0:05:35.680000 - 0:05:38.560000::I'll give you all Pete Davidson's phone number.
0:05:38.560000 - 0:05:43.240000::And I thought that would get like a laugh out of them.
0:05:43.240000 - 0:05:45.640000::And it just I bet.
0:05:45.640000 - 0:05:46.800000::Do they know who he is?
0:05:46.800000 - 0:05:49.160000::You think I wonder if those guys are rocking with his ass?
0:05:49.160000 - 0:05:50.160000::Oh, for everyone.
0:05:50.160000 - 0:05:51.160000::That's a.
0:05:51.160000 - 0:05:52.560000::I should have said that.
0:05:52.560000 - 0:05:54.520000::Yeah, no, they're bumping.
0:05:54.520000 - 0:05:55.520000::And I'm like, I'm a bump.
0:05:55.520000 - 0:05:56.520000::Yes.
0:05:56.520000 - 0:05:57.520000::I'm there.
0:05:57.520000 - 0:05:58.520000::Fucking iPads all day.
0:05:58.520000 - 0:06:05.840000::But yeah, well, Bupkiss goes perfectly with a lot of the beats from who's the kid cutie?
0:06:05.840000 - 0:06:07.880000::If you play a kid cutie instrumentals over the bump.
0:06:07.880000 - 0:06:10.880000::It's show it perfectly lines with the rhythm.
0:06:10.880000 - 0:06:11.880000::That's why they're connected.
0:06:11.880000 - 0:06:13.880000::It's like the Wizard of Oz and Darksett.
0:06:13.880000 - 0:06:15.880000::I wanted to ask you this, Dan.
0:06:15.880000 - 0:06:18.480000::Are you scared of teenage boys at all?
0:06:18.480000 - 0:06:19.480000::Do they like scare you?
0:06:19.480000 - 0:06:26.960000::Because I feel like they're some of the most intimidating sort of age group and gender
0:06:26.960000 - 0:06:28.920000::combination on the planet.
0:06:28.920000 - 0:06:30.240000::Like is it teenage boys?
0:06:30.240000 - 0:06:32.080000::Yeah, they're mysterious.
0:06:32.080000 - 0:06:33.960000::You don't know what they're going to do.
0:06:33.960000 - 0:06:34.960000::They're fearless, too.
0:06:34.960000 - 0:06:35.960000::They have no fear.
0:06:35.960000 - 0:06:37.640000::Yeah, they don't give a shit.
0:06:37.640000 - 0:06:38.640000::They're really rude.
0:06:38.640000 - 0:06:45.200000::They don't have like the social education to know what to say, what not to say.
0:06:45.200000 - 0:06:46.200000::They're.
0:06:46.200000 - 0:06:47.200000::Exactly.
0:06:47.200000 - 0:06:48.200000::I don't know.
0:06:48.200000 - 0:06:49.200000::I'm a little bit scared of them.
0:06:49.240000 - 0:06:53.760000::I think New York City Teen Boys are scarier than Buffalo.
0:06:53.760000 - 0:06:54.760000::New York Teen Boys.
0:06:54.760000 - 0:06:55.760000::They're different.
0:06:55.760000 - 0:06:56.760000::Right.
0:06:56.760000 - 0:06:57.760000::Yeah.
0:06:57.760000 - 0:06:58.760000::Have you seen any of them?
0:06:58.760000 - 0:06:59.760000::The New York City Boys?
0:06:59.760000 - 0:07:00.760000::The New York City Boys.
0:07:00.760000 - 0:07:03.760000::Oh, yeah, absolutely.
0:07:03.760000 - 0:07:09::What was, I saw this.
0:07:09 - 0:07:15.480000::I think Teen Boys are scary, but also even some New York City kids are fucking scary.
0:07:15.480000 - 0:07:19.160000::I saw this guy walking through McCarran Park.
0:07:19.160000 - 0:07:23.760000::He was wearing like a scarf and like a fedora and this five-year-old just ran up to him
0:07:23.760000 - 0:07:28.160000::and pointed at him and went insecure and ran away.
0:07:28.160000 - 0:07:31.160000::Oh, see, that's what I'm talking about.
0:07:31.160000 - 0:07:32.160000::Oh, shit.
0:07:32.160000 - 0:07:33.160000::Jesus.
0:07:33.160000 - 0:07:38.160000::They know just what to say to fucking make them a grown man, crumble.
0:07:38.160000 - 0:07:43.400000::You know, there was also a, when I was in New York, there was like, I think it was a homeless
0:07:43.400000 - 0:07:46.880000::person, but I was kind of like picking my nose for just one second.
0:07:46.880000 - 0:07:48.840000::Literally did this down the street.
0:07:48.840000 - 0:07:53.880000::He sniped me from like a block away and was like, you picking your boogers.
0:07:53.880000 - 0:07:57.880000::Like it was.
0:07:57.880000 - 0:07:59.360000::And I was a child.
0:07:59.360000 - 0:08:00.840000::It was an older man or a child.
0:08:00.840000 - 0:08:01.840000::It was an older man.
0:08:01.840000 - 0:08:02.840000::New York.
0:08:02.840000 - 0:08:06.480000::So maybe it's just New Yorkers or just kind of.
0:08:06.480000 - 0:08:12::One time I thought I had a maybe leukemia or something when I was 23 or 24.
0:08:12 - 0:08:13.800000::I did not for no reason.
0:08:13.800000 - 0:08:15.840000::That was what I was thinking that day.
0:08:15.840000 - 0:08:21.200000::And then I was over at our friend, Joe Scott's house, who had two kids who were like five
0:08:21.200000 - 0:08:23::years old then.
0:08:23 - 0:08:27.920000::And one of them looked at me in the eyes and then got right up into my ear and whispered,
0:08:27.920000 - 0:08:29.920000::something's wrong with him.
0:08:29.920000 - 0:08:34.960000::And I thought, oh my God, like I had, I'm going to die.
0:08:34.960000 - 0:08:35.960000::They know it.
0:08:35.960000 - 0:08:37.960000::So there's something wrong with you.
0:08:37.960000 - 0:08:42.800000::And they're identical to in boys, which is, that is extra scary, you know?
0:08:42.800000 - 0:08:43.800000::That's not right.
0:08:43.800000 - 0:08:47.040000::It might be the scariest combination.
0:08:47.040000 - 0:08:50.560000::Yeah, because you think you killed one and then the other one comes at you with the nine
0:08:50.560000 - 0:08:51.560000::eye.
0:08:51.560000 - 0:08:52.560000::Right.
0:08:52.560000 - 0:08:57.200000::Because if you got rid of it, if you kill a twin, then the other twin has what they call
0:08:57.200000 - 0:08:58.200000::vengeance.
0:08:58.200000 - 0:08:59.200000::Double strength.
0:08:59.200000 - 0:09:00.200000::Double strength against you.
0:09:00.200000 - 0:09:02.520000::Because the soul goes into that other kid's body.
0:09:02.520000 - 0:09:03.520000::And so is the muscle mass.
0:09:03.520000 - 0:09:04.520000::Right.
0:09:04.520000 - 0:09:06.480000::They get double the spiritual strength.
0:09:06.480000 - 0:09:07.480000::End up with the thing.
0:09:07.480000 - 0:09:13.880000::I don't want you to totally reveal your TikTok short film series for 16 parts.
0:09:13.880000 - 0:09:14.880000::All shot.
0:09:14.880000 - 0:09:17.480000::Starting the Sklar Brothers.
0:09:17.480000 - 0:09:18.880000::Oh, shit.
0:09:18.880000 - 0:09:20.880000::I have a two.
0:09:20.880000 - 0:09:24.160000::I see a Sklar brother probably every day.
0:09:24.160000 - 0:09:25.560000::One of them lives by me.
0:09:25.560000 - 0:09:26.560000::Oh, man.
0:09:26.560000 - 0:09:29.760000::And I see one of the Sklar brothers walking around.
0:09:29.760000 - 0:09:32.040000::Maybe it's different ones each time.
0:09:32.040000 - 0:09:33.040000::Maybe it is.
0:09:33.040000 - 0:09:34.040000::Maybe it is.
0:09:34.040000 - 0:09:37.400000::I have a twin sister, but that doesn't really do shit for me, unfortunately.
0:09:37.400000 - 0:09:39.400000::I didn't know that, Dan.
0:09:39.400000 - 0:09:40.400000::Yeah.
0:09:40.400000 - 0:09:45::I got a twin sister and my wife is a triplet.
0:09:45 - 0:09:46::So holy shit.
0:09:46 - 0:09:47::What?
0:09:47 - 0:09:48.800000::So if I didn't know that.
0:09:48.800000 - 0:09:49.800000::Yeah.
0:09:49.800000 - 0:09:52.880000::So if I ever procreate, I'm going to have like five fucking kids.
0:09:52.880000 - 0:09:53.880000::Oh, shit.
0:09:53.880000 - 0:09:54.880000::That's it.
0:09:54.880000 - 0:09:55.880000::I cannot be.
0:09:55.880000 - 0:09:56.880000::Is that genetic?
0:09:56.880000 - 0:09:57.880000::I don't know.
0:09:57.880000 - 0:10:00::If you have twins, you're more likely.

0:10:00 - 0:10:06.760000::to have. I think so. Yeah. Is it really? I think it's like diabetes. Yeah. Oh, dude, my
0:10:06.760000 - 0:10:13.360000::mind is like diabetes. Well, twins, I know a diabetic twin. That's for sure. My dad has
0:10:13.360000 - 0:10:20.200000::a fraternal twin sister and she's fully diabetic as well. Twin, I bet it's the same
0:10:20.200000 - 0:10:27.360000::gene. Do you have diabetes? And your dad has diabetes tendencies? No. Just his, he likes
0:10:27.360000 - 0:10:34.760000::candy, but his sister is the one that has the real diabetes. Oh, shit. Interesting. And
0:10:34.760000 - 0:10:38.760000::yet the government doesn't want us to think about it. That's all right. They do not want to
0:10:38.760000 - 0:10:47.120000::tell you about diabetes. What? All right. I don't have it. What question? Oh, this is good
0:10:47.120000 - 0:10:52.480000::because you might wait. Can we be? Do we bleep out that you're going to maybe be on?
0:10:52.480000 - 0:11:02.720000::Can we say it? Oh, yeah, we can maybe bleep it. When is this coming? Monday, tomorrow. Yeah,
0:11:02.720000 - 0:11:09.280000::maybe bleep it. Maybe bleep it. Right. Everybody say James say James Gordon. All right. So
0:11:09.280000 - 0:11:14.440000::sorry. Well, you have some medic. So you're you're doing basically, we should just talk
0:11:14.440000 - 0:11:19.440000::about the pre are you going on a crazy ass press tour right now, Dan? I mean, you got
0:11:19.440000 - 0:11:24.880000::a promote this shit. First up, you guys were going to ask we have the hardest hitting questions.
0:11:24.880000 - 0:11:33.360000::There's no question that I just tried to type. I just tried to type down a thing to cut out.
0:11:33.360000 - 0:11:46.960000::And I tried to type down all I wrote down was joy tactics. All right. So we're, I would
0:11:46.960000 - 0:11:54.960000::say bodying this one already. So what the hell? How did you choose it to be an hour instead
0:11:54.960000 - 0:12:03.440000::of 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 12, you know? Yeah. I mean, I felt like 45 to an hour was like that,
0:12:03.440000 - 0:12:10.400000::that sweet spot that I wanted to hit. And yeah, damn dude. Yeah, not to go back to what you're
0:12:10.400000 - 0:12:15.840000::saying. I was you guys are the first stop for me on this little press tour I'm doing. I knew
0:12:16.640000 - 0:12:22.480000::you guys would be asking the tough questions and really getting down to the nitty gritty. I was
0:12:22.480000 - 0:12:28::think I was just remembering the like toughest question I've ever asked. I was ever asked, which
0:12:28 - 0:12:34.160000::um, I used to work at a hotel as a bell hop. And there was this like, uh, cleaner there who's
0:12:34.160000 - 0:12:39.200000::Chinese and spoke very little English and for like probably three and a half years, our entire
0:12:39.200000 - 0:12:44.640000::conversations were just, Hey, how are you? Oh, you're working the AM shift today. And then one day
0:12:44.640000 - 0:12:50.640000::after three and a half years, he just says to me, so Dan, would you rather be eaten alive by a
0:12:50.640000 - 0:13:04.080000::tiger or be headed by ISIS? Oh, shit. We need to get his ass on here. That's a good
0:13:04.080000 - 0:13:10.480000::chill. What would you get fuck, would you get fucked up with your co-workers at the hotel or were you
0:13:10.480000 - 0:13:17.360000::kind of a lone, lone operator? You know, there was like this, uh, two month period where for what
0:13:17.360000 - 0:13:22.880000::or no, two months is not correct. Two week period where we were like, huffing computer duster
0:13:22.880000 - 0:13:29.840000::as a joke. And um, he's never done that. It's like a dirty whip it. So like your brain feels like
0:13:29.840000 - 0:13:35.440000::it's going through a wallop pedal and it's, it's pretty, I used to do a bit on stage my first year
0:13:35.440000 - 0:13:40.400000::of comedy where I would huff computer duster on stage. I'd be like, man, I'm really fucking stress
0:13:40.400000 - 0:13:45.600000::out lately. And I'd pull it on my jacket and like actually help it. And then just start screaming
0:13:45.600000 - 0:13:51.200000::like, do you guys hear those helicopters? And then it would wear off. And I'd be like, so
0:13:51.200000 - 0:13:55.360000::anyways, he has ever been the Starbucks. They're always fucking up my name on the cup. And
0:13:57.120000 - 0:14:01.040000::it never, it never really went well. I think it genuinely freaked people out.
0:14:03.040000 - 0:14:08.400000::You could also do, you know what I don't understand scientifically is you turn that can upside
0:14:08.400000 - 0:14:14::down and spray it and it freezes whatever it comes in contact with. Oh yeah, I've heard you can
0:14:14 - 0:14:19.440000::chill beers if they're warm really quick by doing that with a computer duster. Yeah. So I have a
0:14:19.440000 - 0:14:24.880000::mark on my hand from where I would just do it to my hand into my neighbor's hands. And um,
0:14:24.880000 - 0:14:29.040000::I have a mark on my hand from doing that too much. Give it, give me like a little bit of frostbite.
0:14:29.600000 - 0:14:35.520000::Damn dude. Oh, does everybody have a, it's like a little red. You can barely see it. There's like,
0:14:35.520000 - 0:14:42.320000::oh my god. I see it. I see it. That is scarier than a base for the MS-13 tattoo. Basically,
0:14:42.320000 - 0:14:48::is what you have. Don't, don't tell that on here. No. Do you ever do this? Yeah, that's our,
0:14:48 - 0:14:52.800000::Dan, Dan asked before the podcast, what do we not talk about? MS-13 is maybe the number one
0:14:52.800000 - 0:14:59.440000::thing like we don't talk about it. It's a past experiences. Fair enough, dude. I've

0:15:00 - 0:15:02.600000::I'll bite my tongue. You imagine getting all
0:15:03.680000 - 0:15:10.160000::Killed by them good God. I think we could start a gang like of just do you think people would take us seriously?
0:15:10.680000 - 0:15:13.840000::If not at first we would have to make a big statement dude
0:15:16 - 0:15:21.240000::I just watched some music video last night that was like this Mexican gang made their own music video
0:15:21.920000 - 0:15:26.760000::About Donald Trump and they're threatening to like yo if you like come around here dude
0:15:26.920000 - 0:15:31.880000::We'll fucking kill you and I thought it is it is interesting I
0:15:33.280000 - 0:15:35.280000::Don't know something felt okay about that
0:15:36.240000 - 0:15:42.760000::You know what I'm trying to say yeah, I remember when like the Italian the Italian mob made a statement that if I
0:15:42.760000 - 0:15:46.120000::Just ever tried to do a terrorist attack in New York. They would have to
0:15:46.760000 - 0:15:48.760000::Respond to the Italian mob
0:15:51.200000 - 0:15:54::They're like weekend Italian it'll be too late
0:15:54.720000 - 0:15:56.200000::You know
0:15:56.200000 - 0:16:00.320000::So like two Italian guys were like if you like oh
0:16:00.320000 - 0:16:07::But dude if you're somebody sitting in like what did the whatever Pakistan wherever they found been loud in and
0:16:07.320000 - 0:16:09.400000::You think you're just chillin there watching your DVDs
0:16:09.400000 - 0:16:16.160000::You see somebody walking about 20 miles down down the desert you can see them all the way down the who's that walking down in a giant zoot suit
0:16:16.160000 - 0:16:17.440000::Uh-oh
0:16:17.440000 - 0:16:21.120000::Somebody some Italian dude walking by himself through the desert times up tick-tock
0:16:21.240000 - 0:16:26.640000::See what I'm saying that'd be the scariest thing you could ever see in your life a rogue Italian in the desert
0:16:28.040000 - 0:16:33.800000::We should let the mob just exist but they have to like fight wars as well
0:16:33.800000 - 0:16:35.800000::It's like you can like there should be a
0:16:36.640000 - 0:16:38.640000::What is that like a mandatory
0:16:40.240000 - 0:16:44.560000::And it's just like the mob guys they can wear suits
0:16:44.840000 - 0:16:49.760000::But they got to go on the the front lines and they would get I feel like they would get shit done, you know
0:16:49.760000 - 0:16:55.400000::I feel like they get to go back to the United States when the war's over and do all their fucking illegal things and they don't get caught
0:16:56.120000 - 0:17:00.040000::There should be another branch of the military just for Italian guys for sure
0:17:01.160000 - 0:17:03.400000::It's only it would quickly become
0:17:04 - 0:17:08.040000::Mafiosa you know, I'm saying you couldn't even if they weren't initially immediately
0:17:09.360000 - 0:17:11.360000::That smell good
0:17:11.680000 - 0:17:13.680000::That should smell good up in the barracks
0:17:14.040000 - 0:17:23.040000::DeGio, yeah, but that chow time in the canteen a slap will be busing the rounds remember the good fellow scene where they're in prison cooking the meal
0:17:23.040000 - 0:17:25.280000::Mm-hmm, and he's and he's cutting the
0:17:26.160000 - 0:17:31.360000::Garlic slice in the garlic razor thin with razor blade. Oh, yeah, yeah, I like that
0:17:31.360000 - 0:17:36::Oh, when you get my opportunity to Julian take it trust me
0:17:36.600000 - 0:17:38.600000::My barber in New York
0:17:39.200000 - 0:17:43.960000::The one that lives on my street is Albanian never says ordered to me silent the silence the whole time
0:17:44.120000 - 0:17:49.400000::But then his friends come in and they start talking in Albanian, but he he
0:17:50.160000 - 0:17:55.520000::His hands would smell like garlic, but in a way that like most people that would gross me out
0:17:55.520000 - 0:18:00.840000::But for him I just imagine him cooking at home every night and it made me respect him more
0:18:01.160000 - 0:18:04.520000::You know I'm saying yeah, all right. What else?
0:18:09.600000 - 0:18:13.720000::The smell about it was more in respect for sure. That's right
0:18:15 - 0:18:19.080000::Emerald Agassi well, you know what we should talk about we talked about some
0:18:19.080000 - 0:18:24.920000::So Eric you brought up an injury that you had as as a child and Dan you have a pretty
0:18:26.960000 - 0:18:33.840000::I would say public injury that you talk about in the special. I don't want it. Maybe I'll this is kind of a spoiler, but
0:18:34.440000 - 0:18:36.440000::you you did a
0:18:36.720000 - 0:18:38.720000::You're in sort of a jackass crew
0:18:39.560000 - 0:18:44.620000::Right correct. Yeah, and you can I can I say what you what you did?
0:18:44.960000 - 0:18:49.120000::Yeah, yeah go for it. Okay, so you like jumped off of a roof and
0:18:50.360000 - 0:18:58.560000::Broke both of your legs and you were out for for a couple of months right 16 weeks. Yeah
0:18:59.320000 - 0:19:03.360000::Yeah, so I jumped off a Catholic church church with an umbrella
0:19:04.320000 - 0:19:06.320000::Which apparently
0:19:06.320000 - 0:19:12.080000::Apparently kept my spine straight so it prevented any sort of like spinal injury so wow actually
0:19:12.080000 - 0:19:14.640000::Oh my god, I actually did it the right way, but
0:19:17.360000 - 0:19:19.360000::I was pretty
0:19:20.080000 - 0:19:23.440000::Pretty in the jackass at the time me and my buddy Trevor Smith
0:19:23.760000 - 0:19:28.600000::He was kind of like my the Ryan Dunn to my band Marjorie if you will and
0:19:29.200000 - 0:19:31.720000::He should be careful. Oh, I know yeah
0:19:32.200000 - 0:19:39.560000::He would do this thing. I was really sick though where he would like come up to you in the middle of class and just be like
0:19:39.560000 - 0:19:45.120000::Hey, man when you get a chance go check out this location in the school and every time you would go there
0:19:45.400000 - 0:19:48.520000::There would just be a perfect piece of shit there like
0:19:50.320000 - 0:19:54.540000::He was shitting he was shitting, but it was like Banksy where it was like
0:19:54.540000 - 0:20:00.020000::They would ever caught him no universe saw him do it and it was always like perfect like somebody

0:20:00 - 0:20:03.160000::out of a movie and it's like how the fuck did he do this?
0:20:03.160000 - 0:20:04.040000::How did he get it there?
0:20:04.040000 - 0:20:05.040000::What's he eating?
0:20:05.040000 - 0:20:05.840000::Water found.
0:20:05.840000 - 0:20:08.200000::Yeah, it sounds like he's having perfect bowel movement.
0:20:08.200000 - 0:20:10.320000::He knows exactly what he wants.
0:20:10.320000 - 0:20:12.840000::A lot of fiber, a lot of greens for sure.
0:20:12.840000 - 0:20:13.360000::Day of.
0:20:13.360000 - 0:20:14.520000::Good diet.
0:20:14.520000 - 0:20:16.040000::Yeah.
0:20:16.040000 - 0:20:21.560000::I feel like there's a turn in the like,
0:20:21.560000 - 0:20:25.320000::I feel like I grew up in a Jackass style friend group as well.
0:20:25.320000 - 0:20:27.800000::And I think we all were hurting ourselves a lot.
0:20:27.800000 - 0:20:29.120000::And then I feel like there was a turn
0:20:29.120000 - 0:20:31.400000::where it became on each other.
0:20:31.400000 - 0:20:35.040000::And that was kind of the beginning of the wars of like
0:20:35.040000 - 0:20:38.640000::peeing on each other in a sleep all the time.
0:20:38.640000 - 0:20:40.480000::Did it go there?
0:20:40.480000 - 0:20:41.320000::Dude.
0:20:41.320000 - 0:20:43.520000::Prank war.
0:20:43.520000 - 0:20:44.840000::What, we used to peep.
0:20:44.840000 - 0:20:47.720000::My one friend, I don't know if I've told this on here.
0:20:47.720000 - 0:20:49.760000::My friend peed on this other guy.
0:20:49.760000 - 0:20:53.520000::And he didn't forgive him for like 15 years, I want to say.
0:20:53.520000 - 0:20:57.200000::And then a couple of holidays ago, maybe like three years ago.
0:20:57.200000 - 0:20:59::He's like, dude, I'm honestly
0:20:59 - 0:21:02.440000::a mad about it, but I'll forgive you if you let me like spit
0:21:02.440000 - 0:21:05.720000::hell a spit into your mouth right now.
0:21:05.720000 - 0:21:07.160000::And he lied down on the floor.
0:21:07.160000 - 0:21:07.920000::And I filmed it.
0:21:07.920000 - 0:21:10.920000::I have it in slow motion on my phone.
0:21:10.920000 - 0:21:13.720000::It sounds kind of sexual to be frank.
0:21:13.720000 - 0:21:15.680000::A lot of that stuff is.
0:21:15.680000 - 0:21:16.680000::Yeah.
0:21:16.680000 - 0:21:17.680000::That's under too.
0:21:17.680000 - 0:21:20.960000::Maybe he secretly, maybe he secretly liked getting pissed on,
0:21:20.960000 - 0:21:24.240000::but just had, he like over corrected and like had to pretend
0:21:24.240000 - 0:21:25.520000::like it wasn't a king for him.
0:21:25.520000 - 0:21:26.360000::You know what I mean?
0:21:26.360000 - 0:21:26.880000::Right.
0:21:26.880000 - 0:21:27.400000::Yeah.
0:21:27.400000 - 0:21:30.400000::Which male over correction going on, I would say.
0:21:30.400000 - 0:21:31.480000::Yeah.
0:21:31.480000 - 0:21:32.360000::This is a funny.
0:21:32.360000 - 0:21:35.360000::If you ever go to a strip club with your boy before he gets a
0:21:35.360000 - 0:21:38.240000::lap dance, I like to pull the stripper aside and be like, hey,
0:21:38.240000 - 0:21:40.480000::just so you know, my buddy has a shame, kinks.
0:21:40.480000 - 0:21:41.800000::So be extra mean to him.
0:21:41.800000 - 0:21:49.040000::That would, yeah.
0:21:49.040000 - 0:21:51.640000::I couldn't handle that.
0:21:51.640000 - 0:21:55.800000::Yeah, when this one, when the stripper roasts you, that's never
0:21:55.800000 - 0:21:56.640000::a fun feeling.
0:21:56.640000 - 0:21:59.880000::And she goes lamp an Ellie mode on your ass.
0:21:59.880000 - 0:22:04.800000::I think it's funny that because I similarly would try to do
0:22:04.800000 - 0:22:07.840000::Jackass stuff with my friends and watching Jackass when I was
0:22:07.840000 - 0:22:13.040000::like 12, made me feel like it was like a route to becoming like
0:22:13.040000 - 0:22:14.040000::sick.
0:22:14.040000 - 0:22:16.680000::And like, oh, if I could do this shit and have this kind of swag
0:22:16.680000 - 0:22:19.640000::that these guys have, like that would mean that everyone at
0:22:19.640000 - 0:22:21.120000::school is wrong about me.
0:22:21.120000 - 0:22:22.280000::You know what I mean?
0:22:22.280000 - 0:22:25.920000::And so like the soccer all stars weren't like doing Jackass.
0:22:25.920000 - 0:22:29.520000::Like the guys that were like hot, you know, the hot children weren't
0:22:29.520000 - 0:22:30.440000::doing Jackass.
0:22:30.440000 - 0:22:34.240000::It was like guys like us maybe trying to try to break.
0:22:34.240000 - 0:22:38.440000::I think there was there was like a like there were two kind of
0:22:38.440000 - 0:22:42.680000::groups that you could be into sort of get girls in high school.
0:22:42.680000 - 0:22:45.480000::And one of them was like the athlete route.
0:22:45.480000 - 0:22:48.320000::And then the other side of the spectrum was like to be a
0:22:48.320000 - 0:22:52.640000::degenerate like bad boy, the person who had like a parents that
0:22:52.640000 - 0:22:55.120000::didn't give a fuck if you drank your house.
0:22:55.120000 - 0:22:59.640000::And those were the kids that were like skating and doing like the
0:22:59.640000 - 0:23:03.280000::Jackass style like stunts and shit.
0:23:03.280000 - 0:23:04.280000::Yeah.
0:23:04.280000 - 0:23:06.480000::Were you doing this for the ladies, Dan?
0:23:06.480000 - 0:23:08.320000::Or was this for the love of the game?
0:23:08.320000 - 0:23:10::Mostly for the love of the game.
0:23:10 - 0:23:13.360000::I didn't get no love from no ladies back in high schools.
0:23:13.360000 - 0:23:16.360000::Yeah.
0:23:16.360000 - 0:23:17.680000::Just for the lulls.
0:23:17.680000 - 0:23:23.600000::But yeah, the idea of like, yeah, I peed in someone's mouth.
0:23:23.600000 - 0:23:25::I got my mouth peed in.
0:23:25 - 0:23:26.880000::Would you hook up with me?
0:23:26.880000 - 0:23:28.480000::You like that, right?
0:23:28.480000 - 0:23:30.520000::You like that, right?
0:23:30.520000 - 0:23:35.080000::I would also, I would like to get fully like drunk in school too.
0:23:35.080000 - 0:23:38.960000::Like I would go to McDonald's before school, get like a fucking
0:23:38.960000 - 0:23:43.280000::giant Coca-Cola dump out like a third of it filled the rest with
0:23:43.280000 - 0:23:45.920000::Jack Daniels and just walk around school drinking.
0:23:45.920000 - 0:23:51::And I remember once I couldn't mean Trevor Smith,
0:23:51 - 0:23:54.920000::drank a whole bottle of Yeager Meister before school.
0:23:54.920000 - 0:23:58.760000::And I was so drunk in math class that I puked in my backpack.
0:23:58.760000 - 0:24:01.640000::But I did it.
0:24:01.640000 - 0:24:05.720000::I did it like the smart way that I let it fill up in my mouth and
0:24:05.720000 - 0:24:09.640000::then spit it into my backpack as opposed to like, you know, but
0:24:09.640000 - 0:24:11.920000::yeah, I was just so stressed.
0:24:11.920000 - 0:24:15.800000::I'm gonna get kicked out of the play.
0:24:15.800000 - 0:24:18.360000::I didn't get kicked out of the play.
0:24:18.360000 - 0:24:19.520000::Yeah, I love that.
0:24:19.520000 - 0:24:22.400000::When you zoom in on that picture of you sitting on the ground,
0:24:22.400000 - 0:24:23.360000::you know what I mean?
0:24:23.360000 - 0:24:24.360000::Yeah.
0:24:24.360000 - 0:24:27.160000::Did you do a lot of plays in high school?
0:24:27.160000 - 0:24:29.480000::Were you in it from the get-go or just a couple?
0:24:29.480000 - 0:24:30.560000::I did a couple.
0:24:30.560000 - 0:24:31.960000::Yeah.
0:24:31.960000 - 0:24:32.800000::What was that?
0:24:32.800000 - 0:24:33.840000::What was that one?
0:24:33.840000 - 0:24:37.520000::That was when I played the cat in the hat in
0:24:37.520000 - 0:24:38.840000::Sucical and Musical.
0:24:38.840000 - 0:24:42.440000::How can you crush that before?
0:24:42.440000 - 0:24:46.040000::Were you so, do you remember being like crazy as fuck nervous
0:24:46.040000 - 0:24:47.400000::or were you like fuck this?
0:24:47.400000 - 0:24:49.440000::I got this.
0:24:49.440000 - 0:24:50.880000::Damn, I don't remember.
0:24:50.880000 - 0:24:52.440000::I don't know like.
0:24:52.440000 - 0:24:53.800000::You were the star.
0:24:53.800000 - 0:24:55.080000::Yeah, yeah, it was.
0:24:55.080000 - 0:24:57.040000::You're probably black out.
0:24:57.040000 - 0:24:58.040000::Yeah.
0:24:58.040000 - 0:25:00.040000::I was so drunk.

0:25:00 - 0:25:01.280000::Well, liquid courage.
0:25:03.600000 - 0:25:06.040000::16 years old, like fucked up on Jack Daniels.
0:25:06.040000 - 0:25:12.560000::Just, uh, yeah, just fun doing just, uh, taking, taking shots of Bacardi limone backstage.
0:25:13.560000 - 0:25:17.880000::Well, you have to, you would have to imagine that in the days of old and the medieval days
0:25:17.880000 - 0:25:23.920000::when they'd take plays around the medieval times, those were probably mostly children
0:25:23.920000 - 0:25:29.640000::because you died by age 30 and they were probably fucked up on wine, uh, meat, whatever
0:25:29.640000 - 0:25:30.640000::that could get their hands on.
0:25:30.640000 - 0:25:35.560000::So if you were drunk, you were, that's just continuing if that's being tradition.
0:25:35.560000 - 0:25:40.720000::So I just, just to make you feel better, like, he wouldn't be the first.
0:25:40.720000 - 0:25:41.720000::Thanks.
0:25:41.720000 - 0:25:43.720000::Did I make you feel better?
0:25:43.720000 - 0:25:45.720000::Did I make you feel better, Brad?
0:25:45.720000 - 0:25:46.720000::Yeah.
0:25:46.720000 - 0:25:48.720000::That's what we do.
0:25:48.720000 - 0:25:49.720000::It's joy tactics.
0:25:49.720000 - 0:25:55.080000::And so, yeah, when we find, when Eric, particularly Eric, when he smells damage on somebody,
0:25:55.080000 - 0:26:00.280000::he kind of goes in like a Labrador retriever and, uh, yeah, he says stuff like that.
0:26:00.280000 - 0:26:01.280000::Yeah.
0:26:01.280000 - 0:26:03.640000::Pretty easily makes someone feel much better about themselves.
0:26:03.640000 - 0:26:04.640000::Yeah.
0:26:04.640000 - 0:26:05.640000::It was pretty sweet.
0:26:05.640000 - 0:26:09.880000::I would, I would also operate a motor vehicle and I was black out drunk.
0:26:09.880000 - 0:26:10.880000::That was that okay, dude?
0:26:10.880000 - 0:26:13.440000::Is that a tradition somewhere?
0:26:13.440000 - 0:26:14.440000::You know what?
0:26:14.440000 - 0:26:15.440000::Yeah, I forgive you for that.
0:26:15.440000 - 0:26:16.440000::I don't know if you could do this.
0:26:16.440000 - 0:26:18.120000::Well, there's a lot of work this year, but I forgive you.
0:26:18.120000 - 0:26:21.400000::This is a, this podcast is about forgiveness more than anything.
0:26:21.400000 - 0:26:26.840000::So, yeah, you might have done some fucked up shit in your life, but, uh, yeah, you're,
0:26:26.840000 - 0:26:29.120000::you're forgiving in the eyes of God.
0:26:29.120000 - 0:26:30.120000::That's for sure.
0:26:30.120000 - 0:26:32.120000::And then I do go to a place of ideas.
0:26:32.120000 - 0:26:33.120000::Well, thank you.
0:26:33.120000 - 0:26:36.360000::I do go to confession pretty much every day.
0:26:36.360000 - 0:26:38.280000::Uh, go to a Catholic church.
0:26:38.280000 - 0:26:43.960000::I take the Staten Island ferry to Staten Island and go to a Catholic church and go to confession.
0:26:43.960000 - 0:26:48.760000::And, uh, you know, you got to tell the priest every time you beat off because that is a
0:26:48.760000 - 0:26:49.760000::sin.
0:26:49.760000 - 0:26:50.760000::So, I promise.
0:26:51.160000 - 0:26:52.400000::I'm there all the time.
0:26:52.400000 - 0:26:56.200000::I'm always going to and fro Staten Island.
0:26:56.200000 - 0:26:58.280000::We got to take you to Italy to do the big confession.
0:26:58.280000 - 0:26:59.280000::You know what I'm saying?
0:26:59.280000 - 0:27:00.280000::Ooh, yeah.
0:27:00.280000 - 0:27:02.840000::Because I can confession to one of those priests when they're speaking.
0:27:02.840000 - 0:27:03.840000::The Vatican.
0:27:03.840000 - 0:27:05.360000::Okay, here's the cruise.
0:27:05.360000 - 0:27:07.680000::You go on the forgiven.
0:27:07.680000 - 0:27:10.400000::This is the Staten Island, basically the Hodge.
0:27:10.400000 - 0:27:12.600000::If that's what that word is, the mecca.
0:27:12.600000 - 0:27:13.920000::You get the Italian mecca.
0:27:13.920000 - 0:27:15.840000::You get onto the Staten Island ferry.
0:27:15.840000 - 0:27:17.440000::It goes across the whole Atlantic Ocean.
0:27:17.440000 - 0:27:19.960000::You got to jerk it the whole time, top the bottom.
0:27:19.960000 - 0:27:23.080000::You get to the end, you land in Italy, and you do the final.
0:27:23.080000 - 0:27:24.080000::You know what I'm saying?
0:27:24.080000 - 0:27:29.200000::Confession of like, it's like a, I guess Italian thing.
0:27:29.200000 - 0:27:30.200000::I don't know.
0:27:30.200000 - 0:27:31.200000::I'm not Italian, so I couldn't.
0:27:31.200000 - 0:27:32.200000::Well, I'm going to watch this.
0:27:32.200000 - 0:27:33.200000::Watch this.
0:27:33.200000 - 0:27:34.200000::Was it porn?
0:27:34.200000 - 0:27:35.200000::You guys are showing us?
0:27:35.200000 - 0:27:38::No, I'm going to tell you what you would say.
0:27:38 - 0:27:39::No, yeah.
0:27:39 - 0:27:43.640000::I would love to do some speed two cruise control type shit where I hijacked the Staten Island
0:27:43.640000 - 0:27:45.640000::ferry and just take it all the way to Rome.
0:27:45.640000 - 0:27:46.640000::That would be great.
0:27:46.640000 - 0:27:47.640000::Oh, yeah.
0:27:47.640000 - 0:27:49.080000::Everybody would be happy that you did it too.
0:27:49.080000 - 0:27:50.080000::That's the difference.
0:27:50.080000 - 0:27:51.080000::Yeah.
0:27:51.080000 - 0:27:52.080000::That was low.
0:27:52.080000 - 0:27:54.080000::Did you guys hear that?
0:27:54.080000 - 0:27:56.080000::The Opinus Trattonato.
0:27:56.080000 - 0:27:57.560000::Well, Opinus Trattonato.
0:27:57.560000 - 0:27:59.960000::That's what you would say to that.
0:27:59.960000 - 0:28:01.880000::That means I just jerked it.
0:28:01.880000 - 0:28:06.200000::And that's what you would say.
0:28:06.200000 - 0:28:12::To the Italian priest at the top of the mountain top and that old timey fucking church.
0:28:12 - 0:28:14.200000::He daps you up.
0:28:14.200000 - 0:28:17.600000::Don't dapp me up and say, here, hit this shit.
0:28:17.600000 - 0:28:18.600000::Yeah.
0:28:18.600000 - 0:28:19.600000::Give me a towel.
0:28:19.600000 - 0:28:20.600000::Towing, Salvia.
0:28:20.600000 - 0:28:21.600000::Yeah.

0:28:22.600000 - 0:28:26.600000::In Salvia with the balsamic vinaigrette bubbler.
0:28:26.600000 - 0:28:27.600000::Something like that.
0:28:27.600000 - 0:28:28.600000::Here.

0:28:35.600000 - 0:28:40.600000::Oh, Nate just dapp my ass up with a non-alcoholic peroni the other night.
0:28:40.600000 - 0:28:44.440000::Oh, the zero point zero peronies.
0:28:44.440000 - 0:28:46.600000::Those shit's hit.
0:28:46.600000 - 0:28:50.880000::They hit differently in the NA space.
0:28:50.880000 - 0:28:52.160000::They are delicious.
0:28:52.160000 - 0:28:54.360000::It's good as hell.
0:28:54.360000 - 0:28:55.360000::Absolutely delicious.
0:28:55.360000 - 0:28:58.600000::Dan, do you ever drink NA beers?
0:28:58.600000 - 0:28:59.600000::No, bro.
0:28:59.600000 - 0:29:00.600000::I need that.
0:29:00.600000 - 0:29:01.600000::I need that.
0:29:01.600000 - 0:29:02.600000::You have that full power.
0:29:02.600000 - 0:29:03.600000::Yeah, man.
0:29:03.600000 - 0:29:11.800000::Drinking NA beers for me, that'd be like smoking a CBD version of crack, you know what I
0:29:11.800000 - 0:29:12.800000::mean?
0:29:12.800000 - 0:29:13.800000::I need to get some.
0:29:13.800000 - 0:29:14.800000::Wait a minute.
0:29:14.800000 - 0:29:15.800000::Uh oh.
0:29:15.800000 - 0:29:20.320000::It just influences your body, but you don't get like you get the body high from crack,
0:29:20.320000 - 0:29:21.800000::but you don't feel high.
0:29:21.800000 - 0:29:27.800000::Oh, the body crack is amazing.
0:29:27.800000 - 0:29:31.800000::A hole in the market has just been exposed by the way once again.
0:29:31.800000 - 0:29:35.800000::Pure CBD crystal that you're smoking outside the 7-11.
0:29:35.800000 - 0:29:36.800000::Yeah.
0:29:36.800000 - 0:29:38.400000::Well, this is what I keep saying.
0:29:38.400000 - 0:29:42.720000::It's like liquid death needs to branch out into these harder drugs because they do like
0:29:42.720000 - 0:29:48.600000::here's the cute royalty free version of beer, whatever.
0:29:48.600000 - 0:29:52.840000::Now it's here's, you know, here's the way.
0:29:52.840000 - 0:29:54.360000::Is my mic still working?
0:29:54.360000 - 0:29:56.200000::I just touched something wrong.
0:29:56.200000 - 0:29:58.200000::Yeah, I can hear you louder.
0:29:58.200000 - 0:29:59.200000::I can hear you louder.
0:29:59.200000 - 0:30:00.200000::I can hear you.
0:30:00.200000 - 0:30:01.200000::I did it.

0:30:00 - 0:30:07::again. No, no, no, Jack now. Jack's mic broke on the last podcast. That's how much
0:30:07 - 0:30:12.560000::that's how much that's how hard we go on these podcasts is that the the mics can't even
0:30:12.560000 - 0:30:19::handle. Right. Was it like this when you went on Tiger Belly? Dan, it was just like this.
0:30:19 - 0:30:28.600000::I, yeah. You're not going to believe how I stopped hearing everybody. I pressed the mute
0:30:28.600000 - 0:30:35.840000::button on my keyboard. I didn't realize I have hilarious. Bruh, we don't know how to
0:30:35.840000 - 0:30:43.480000::produce. Well, this is what I want to ask you, Dan. Are you, are you, is there any sort
0:30:43.480000 - 0:30:49.200000::of movement in getting you on Steve O's while ride? Dude, I would absolutely love that. I
0:30:49.200000 - 0:30:55.120000::don't know if any listeners or if anybody has any connections to Steve O, um, there's
0:30:55.120000 - 0:30:59.560000::got to be somebody listening right now. Somebody knows somebody you know, somebody's in
0:30:59.560000 - 0:31:05.200000::the east of the, let's get fucking Dan Lakata on Steve O's fucking wild ride. How are
0:31:05.200000 - 0:31:13::we truly be a dream come true? And I have met him once before. He was cool as hell. I made
0:31:13 - 0:31:17.260000::him, I made him laugh. He told me just got a vasectomy and it was really expensive to
0:31:17.260000 - 0:31:22.920000::freeze. Come and I was like, dude, I'll let you keep your come in my freezer for 20 bucks.
0:31:22.920000 - 0:31:29.760000::And he kind of laughed his friggin ass off at that. So that's amazing. We already have
0:31:29.760000 - 0:31:35.640000::a good rapport. That's the risk. Right. Wow. Oh, shit. We should all go get faded with
0:31:35.640000 - 0:31:43.200000::Steve O. He don't do that no more. He's like, if that like really broke your heart, like,
0:31:43.200000 - 0:31:50.480000::you're like, oh man. That's awesome. Happy for him. Pony is has awesome. Not easy as
0:31:50.480000 - 0:31:57.880000::well. Pony is with his boot. Pony has got a pod. Yeah. Pony has got a party. They're
0:31:57.880000 - 0:32:04.240000::still boys, right? Oh, they're still boys. Oh, yeah. Are they tuned? Who are they not
0:32:04.240000 - 0:32:12::boys with? Bam has kind of burned a lot of. Well, but I feel like the doors always open.
0:32:12 - 0:32:16.440000::Well, they try to help him. He was on the pod together. He was on Steve O's wild ride
0:32:16.440000 - 0:32:20.960000::at one point. And they were kind of like, he was kind of encouraging him to go on his
0:32:20.960000 - 0:32:26.240000::a, a sobriety journey with, you know, Steve O. And he was encouraging him. He's like, man,
0:32:26.240000 - 0:32:30.640000::we're going to get you like, I think I, Steve O seems like he's a good friend in that
0:32:30.640000 - 0:32:34.840000::he was like, I'm going to try and like, hook him up with like the things that I've learned
0:32:34.840000 - 0:32:40::and, you know, set him up with his YouTube channel and have him, yeah, you know, be able
0:32:40 - 0:32:45.160000::to sustain and, and he was like, he was like, I, I think he got him on stage. Like,
0:32:45.160000 - 0:32:53::he did stand up with Steve O. We should have an intervention. Hey, man, like, we're all
0:32:53 - 0:32:58.240000::very aware of your addiction issues. So we know we got your YouTube channel already in
0:32:58.240000 - 0:33:09.400000::the works. We got to be okay, man. Like, here's my dark suspicion. Okay. Here's my dark.
0:33:09.400000 - 0:33:12.240000::I don't want to get into this too much. This is by the way, this is a segment that we have
0:33:12.240000 - 0:33:22.400000::is air dark. I feel like if Bam were to start profiting off of that YouTube channel set
0:33:22.400000 - 0:33:28.920000::up by Steve O's company, Steve O would start to get a little cut. Okay. Hmm. And Steve
0:33:28.920000 - 0:33:34.920000::O would start. You know, I'm saying you see the evil. I don't see the evil. I see
0:33:34.920000 - 0:33:40.560000::realness and, you know, I'm saying, you're saying this has the potential to be a pyramid
0:33:40.560000 - 0:33:48.160000::scheme where like, you know, something. Yeah. Okay. And then he's a a a a both a's are
0:33:48.160000 - 0:33:55.880000::like, a a a a. Interesting. Something to notice. I walk by a a meeting room the other day
0:33:55.880000 - 0:34:01.520000::and people were busing down. There was crazy music playing crumping. Oh, it's a I don't
0:34:01.520000 - 0:34:05.800000::know what they were a meeting's been popping. Maybe a club rented it. Maybe a okay,
0:34:05.800000 - 0:34:12.040000::rented it out for the night. Oh, a okay. But I was going to ask you then if you were to
0:34:12.040000 - 0:34:17.520000::start your own podcasts and we enjoy tactics, productions kind of came to you and was like,
0:34:17.520000 - 0:34:22.600000::yo, you can put it under our channel. What what percentage would you be offended with?
0:34:22.600000 - 0:34:28.200000::Like, like that. We were like, yo, we get this percentage of the cut of, you know, the
0:34:28.200000 - 0:34:32.280000::ads and everything. What at what percentage would it be like, we're taking advantage of
0:34:32.280000 - 0:34:40.280000::you and it's like not okay. I think if you asked for 99% of it, I'd be like, I'm
0:34:40.280000 - 0:34:48.240000::little too much. I need to all I need is 2% baby. You know, bro, we got to like, I love
0:34:48.240000 - 0:34:52.880000::negotiating so fucking. I think I think once you came on our network, you would start to
0:34:52.880000 - 0:34:59.040000::notice many things start to change for you. If you saw the subscriber count on our YouTube,
0:34:59.040000 - 0:34:59.960000::it would start to

0:35:00 - 0:35:03.040000::You would become disturbed pretty quickly with the attention that you'd receive.
0:35:03.040000 - 0:35:04.080000::I'll just just wait.
0:35:04.240000 - 0:35:05.280000::Just wait Monday.
0:35:05.280000 - 0:35:08.720000::Once this drops, you will see a sky rocket.
0:35:08.720000 - 0:35:10.400000::This is going to be on the you Mr. Beast.
0:35:10.400000 - 0:35:11.120000::It's going to be Mr.
0:35:11.120000 - 0:35:14.840000::Beast Dan Lakata for the boys on the front page of YouTube.
0:35:14.840000 - 0:35:16.840000::It's going to be a lot of people come on here.
0:35:16.840000 - 0:35:21.120000::We haven't had many guests, but many of them have seen a joy tactics.
0:35:21.120000 - 0:35:24.560000::Bump like well, we should.
0:35:25.560000 - 0:35:26::Sorry.
0:35:26 - 0:35:27.160000::No, sorry to cut you off.
0:35:27.160000 - 0:35:28.680000::You mentioned Mr. Beast just now.
0:35:28.680000 - 0:35:31.320000::I'm also trying to get in touch with Mr.
0:35:31.320000 - 0:35:33.800000::Beast if any listeners have any connections to him.
0:35:34.320000 - 0:35:41.360000::I have an idea for how to put out the wildfires in California and Canada and all of that.
0:35:41.680000 - 0:35:44.840000::So basically the thumbnail of the video would be Mr.
0:35:44.840000 - 0:35:48.240000::Beast making the soy face.
0:35:48.240000 - 0:35:54.240000::And I would say I bought 5,000 helicopters and 10,000 Sibians.
0:35:54.240000 - 0:35:54.840000::Okay.
0:35:55.160000 - 0:36:00.960000::And the idea is on each helicopter, you have two Sibians hanging down with
0:36:01.960000 - 0:36:06.480000::ropes and you have a woman on each Sibian and they're going to fly them over the fires
0:36:06.480000 - 0:36:11.480000::and they will squirt onto the fire to put them out.
0:36:12.040000 - 0:36:12.960000::Wow.
0:36:13.200000 - 0:36:13.920000::That would be.
0:36:13.920000 - 0:36:16.640000::This sounds like a scene from Mad Max or dooners.
0:36:16.640000 - 0:36:18.240000::That would be like so cinematic.
0:36:18.440000 - 0:36:19.280000::Yeah, we'll do.
0:36:19.280000 - 0:36:20.800000::And they're actually the heroes.
0:36:20.800000 - 0:36:21.120000::Those.
0:36:21.120000 - 0:36:23.440000::Well, let me save you a bunch of money on Sibians right now.
0:36:23.800000 - 0:36:30.200000::Just put Nate with 20 women in a slingshot together or something and just let him do his thing up in the air.
0:36:31.600000 - 0:36:32.400000::That's a new money.
0:36:32.400000 - 0:36:32.880000::Yeah.
0:36:34.400000 - 0:36:35.280000::Nate's bit.
0:36:35.280000 - 0:36:35.920000::Yeah, right.
0:36:36.440000 - 0:36:37.520000::That would be the most.
0:36:37.520000 - 0:36:42.880000::I think that would be the most viewed video ever in the history of just the internet.
0:36:42.880000 - 0:36:43.440000::Oh, dude.
0:36:43.440000 - 0:36:44.680000::There's every day you do it.
0:36:44.680000 - 0:36:47.280000::You get another dollar $10,000.
0:36:48.120000 - 0:36:48.640000::Right.
0:36:49.080000 - 0:36:53.160000::Nate, I feel like in that situation, you would have some type of war paint on your face like a.
0:36:53.600000 - 0:36:56.680000::Like this, even though the special orcs from the Lord of the Rings.
0:36:57.920000 - 0:36:59.680000::The Rokai had to have a hand print.
0:36:59.920000 - 0:37:00.600000::You'd have that.
0:37:00.600000 - 0:37:01.320000::Just catch up.
0:37:01.320000 - 0:37:02.520000::You'd be all old up.
0:37:03.280000 - 0:37:05.720000::I just rolled back in your head and you would do that shit.
0:37:05.720000 - 0:37:08.280000::So fucking fast with such precision and such care.
0:37:08.880000 - 0:37:09.320000::Catch up.
0:37:09.320000 - 0:37:10.720000::It would be a national hero.
0:37:10.720000 - 0:37:13.920000::But you would, I think you would have to doubt like that's a suicide mission sort of.
0:37:13.920000 - 0:37:14.480000::Yeah, yeah.
0:37:14.480000 - 0:37:15.520000::If you're being slingshot it.
0:37:18.160000 - 0:37:20::Maybe there's something else on the end of it.
0:37:21.120000 - 0:37:21.640000::Right.
0:37:22.120000 - 0:37:23.400000::Just because Nate's paradise.
0:37:24.200000 - 0:37:25.640000::A bunch of sheep or something.
0:37:28.640000 - 0:37:32.600000::Oh, you don't give a sheep a haircut for a couple of a couple of years or two.
0:37:32.960000 - 0:37:37.760000::Give him a, oh, dude, when I see a sheep, I start drizzling manoxidil all over their heads.
0:37:38.280000 - 0:37:39.080000::Give him the.
0:37:39.080000 - 0:37:39.760000::Get it.
0:37:39.760000 - 0:37:40.920000::Give him extra as hair.
0:37:41.360000 - 0:37:45.040000::Yo, Eric, you got to get your barber to give them sheep a nice fade.
0:37:45.040000 - 0:37:49.320000::Where it's like, oh, I want to see a sheep with like a skin fade.
0:37:49.320000 - 0:37:50.120000::I'll line up.
0:37:50.120000 - 0:37:50.960000::She signs.
0:37:52.240000 - 0:37:55.200000::Michael Jordan's jersey number 23 on the side.
0:37:55.400000 - 0:37:56.080000::You know what I'm saying?
0:37:57.160000 - 0:37:58.320000::Guard the garlic fade.
0:37:59.080000 - 0:38:01.360000::Yeah, the garlic fade.
0:38:01.360000 - 0:38:01.880000::Yeah.
0:38:01.880000 - 0:38:05.760000::And I think I've talked about him before, but you'd have a he has a bird up in his place.
0:38:06.080000 - 0:38:07.360000::That's singing the whole time.
0:38:07.720000 - 0:38:08.520000::Glow loud.
0:38:09.160000 - 0:38:11.760000::Oh, so yeah.
0:38:14.800000 - 0:38:15.560000::Birds are cool.
0:38:15.840000 - 0:38:16.360000::Bird.
0:38:16.840000 - 0:38:19.080000::You know that they could live hell along.
0:38:20.040000 - 0:38:20.480000::Birds.
0:38:20.480000 - 0:38:25.160000::Yeah, they could be, they're like lifetime companions of like some kind of 80, bro, 80.
0:38:25.920000 - 0:38:26.680000::Jesus.
0:38:27.080000 - 0:38:27.520000::What?

0:40:01.600000 - 0:40:05.200000::Now I need to check out where he lives because we got to go visit him.
0:40:05.200000 - 0:40:07.440000::He saw a melted turtle.
0:40:07.440000 - 0:40:10.040000::Oh Jonathan is his name.
0:40:10.040000 - 0:40:14.760000::Jonathan is a giant tortoise and he is okay.
0:40:14.760000 - 0:40:19.240000::He's not 180 but he's he's born in 1832.

0:40:41.160000 - 0:40:42.160000::Why am I not surprised?
0:40:42.160000 - 0:40:45.160000::He lives on the grounds of the plantation house.
0:40:45.160000 - 0:40:46.160000::Hell nah.
0:40:46.160000 - 0:40:47.160000::Oh.

0:40:50.160000 - 0:40:53.160000::Jonathan, you're kidding.
0:40:53.160000 - 0:40:54.160000::Jonathan, the turtle.
0:40:54.160000 - 0:40:55.160000::You guys want to see this?
0:40:55.160000 - 0:40:57.160000::Yeah, I would like to.
0:40:57.160000 - 0:41:00.160000::And then I want to look out for him to be careful.
0:41:00.160000 - 0:41:01.160000::Oh my god.
0:41:01.160000 - 0:41:03.160000::Yeah, we need Jordan Clepper to roast this.
0:41:03.160000 - 0:41:04.160000::Jordan Clepper.
0:41:04.160000 - 0:41:05.160000::Yeah.
0:41:05.160000 - 0:41:07.160000::Listen now.
0:41:07.160000 - 0:41:11.840000::I just want to say Jonathan, the turtle, if I ever see you, I'm going to do some cannibal
0:41:11.840000 - 0:41:12.840000::Holocaust.
0:41:12.840000 - 0:41:13.840000::Shit.
0:41:13.840000 - 0:41:14.840000::You.
0:41:14.840000 - 0:41:18.840000::You'll ever see cannibal Holocaust.
0:41:18.840000 - 0:41:19.840000::Yeah.
0:41:19.840000 - 0:41:22.160000::I saw that actually it's very upsetting.
0:41:22.160000 - 0:41:24.160000::There's a good actually.
0:41:24.160000 - 0:41:25.160000::Sounds awful.
0:41:25.160000 - 0:41:26.160000::Oh.
0:41:26.160000 - 0:41:27.160000::And just dismember it.
0:41:27.160000 - 0:41:30.160000::It's very upsetting to watch.
0:41:30.160000 - 0:41:37.160000::Don't they bury a baby in the mud and put a woman on a spike?
0:41:37.160000 - 0:41:39.160000::Wait, what is it?
0:41:39.160000 - 0:41:41.160000::No, I've never heard of this.
0:41:41.160000 - 0:41:43.160000::What is cannibal Holocaust?
0:41:43.160000 - 0:41:44.160000::Yeah.
0:41:44.160000 - 0:41:46.160000::Is it like a documentary?
0:41:46.160000 - 0:41:48.160000::Well, it's a fake documentary.
0:41:48.160000 - 0:41:56.160000::The human murder stuff was faked, but the animal murders that they do in the movie are
0:41:56.160000 - 0:41:57.160000::100% real.
0:41:57.160000 - 0:42:00.160000::Like 1980 years, some shit.
0:42:00.160000 - 0:42:01.160000::Oh, shit.
0:42:01.160000 - 0:42:02.160000::So, wow.
0:42:02.160000 - 0:42:05.160000::Any animal you see, pre-the 90s is dead.
0:42:05.160000 - 0:42:10.160000::If you saw it in on film, captured on a camera, it's dead.
0:42:10.160000 - 0:42:12.160000::They killed that thing right after they wrapped it.
0:42:12.160000 - 0:42:13.160000::Well, let me blow your mind.
0:42:13.160000 - 0:42:16.160000::You can do the same thing with humans if you go far enough back.
0:42:16.160000 - 0:42:20.160000::So, we were talking about Wizard of Oz earlier, right?
0:42:20.160000 - 0:42:21.160000::Right.
0:42:21.160000 - 0:42:22.160000::Run of them are alive anymore.
0:42:22.160000 - 0:42:24.160000::That's all ghosts on film.
0:42:24.160000 - 0:42:27.160000::That's a living cemetery, essentially like a cemetery.
0:42:27.160000 - 0:42:30.160000::What about if there's a bird or a turtle in it?
0:42:30.160000 - 0:42:32.160000::Well, there's a tortoise.
0:42:32.160000 - 0:42:33.160000::Maybe Jonathan's in that shit.
0:42:33.160000 - 0:42:34.160000::Yeah, I don't know.
0:42:34.160000 - 0:42:35.160000::But.
0:42:35.160000 - 0:42:36.160000::There's flying monkeys.
0:42:36.160000 - 0:42:37.160000::Those are probably.
0:42:37.160000 - 0:42:39.160000::Oh, hell, nah.
0:42:39.160000 - 0:42:40.160000::I see a flying monkey.
0:42:40.160000 - 0:42:41.160000::Imagine that.
0:42:41.160000 - 0:42:42.160000::Yeah, right.
0:42:42.160000 - 0:42:45.160000::I'm not sure if that's our, trying to freak out.
0:42:45.160000 - 0:42:47.160000::We talked about so much stuff in the sky today.
0:42:47.160000 - 0:42:48.160000::Isn't that cool?
0:42:48.160000 - 0:42:49.160000::Right.
0:42:49.160000 - 0:42:51.160000::Jewish motorcross, Nate, they're gonna.
0:42:51.160000 - 0:42:52.160000::Yeah.
0:42:52.160000 - 0:42:53.160000::Interesting.
0:42:53.160000 - 0:42:56.160000::What's up with that?
0:42:56.160000 - 0:42:57.160000::I don't know.
0:42:57.160000 - 0:42:59.160000::And it was supposed to be about high school.
0:42:59.160000 - 0:43:02.160000::But you see, you see, Dan, how our minds work on this shit.
0:43:02.160000 - 0:43:04.160000::We can't be held by a single topic.
0:43:04.160000 - 0:43:11.160000::Well, Dan, you also went to school, high school with another amazing comedian, Joe Pere.
0:43:11.160000 - 0:43:16.160000::You guys were, you guys were in the same grade or was this a dude?
0:43:16.160000 - 0:43:18.160000::Joe's actually a year older than me.
0:43:18.160000 - 0:43:19.160000::Wow, really?
0:43:19.160000 - 0:43:20.160000::My elder.
0:43:20.160000 - 0:43:21.160000::Oh, this fuck.
0:43:21.160000 - 0:43:28.160000::But yeah, we met in the, but Joe wasn't in like the, he wasn't into like the Jackass shit.
0:43:28.160000 - 0:43:31.160000::No, he was never there.
0:43:31.160000 - 0:43:34.160000::He was the first guy to visit me in the hospital after I broke my legs though.
0:43:34.160000 - 0:43:35.160000::I like what's up.
0:43:35.160000 - 0:43:36.160000::That's a friend.
0:43:36.160000 - 0:43:39.160000::I woke up from a more fiend-induced nap.
0:43:39.160000 - 0:43:46.160000::And I just saw Joe sitting there in a chair and he just goes, what happened?
0:43:46.160000 - 0:43:49.160000::Sorry, dude.
0:43:49.160000 - 0:43:55.160000::Do you remember when you not to bring this horrible memory back, but when you fell off the roof,
0:43:55.160000 - 0:43:56.160000::do you remember screaming?
0:43:56.160000 - 0:43:57.160000::Or was it just like?
0:43:57.160000 - 0:43:58.160000::Yeah.
0:43:58.160000 - 0:44:00.160000::Yeah, I just screamed fuck.

0:44:08.160000 - 0:44:15.160000::Because imagine if that motherfucker forgot to press record, how horrible it would have been.
0:44:15.160000 - 0:44:16.160000::Good, yeah.
0:44:16.160000 - 0:44:18.160000::And bone was coming out now.

0:46:18.880000 - 0:46:25.720000::I think I was just like on morphine and I was just like, there was one episode where
0:46:25.720000 - 0:46:31.240000::there was like a rat in the guy's trunk and I was like, yeah, it was so great.
0:46:31.240000 - 0:46:33.960000::They had a little house for a rat or something in there?
0:46:33.960000 - 0:46:34.960000::Yeah.
0:46:34.960000 - 0:46:42.400000::They built them a little, they put a tech deck on his, taped a tech deck to his legs and
0:46:42.400000 - 0:46:47.760000::built him, they recreated the warehouse level from Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1 in the trunk.
0:46:47.760000 - 0:46:50.760000::So the rat could do some fucking.
0:46:50.760000 - 0:46:54.760000::I wish I was a rat in this one moment.
0:46:54.760000 - 0:46:55.760000::Yeah.
0:46:55.760000 - 0:46:58.760000::Pete, I mean, okay.

0:47:08.160000 - 0:47:10.960000::Muppet number one is Takashi 69.
0:47:10.960000 - 0:47:14.920000::So, you know what?
0:47:14.920000 - 0:47:20.640000::Takashi 69 got me out of jury duty recently because I was doing, uh, I had to go in, I got
0:47:20.640000 - 0:47:27.520000::jury duty and I went in and the case was like, you know, racketeering gang things and
0:47:27.520000 - 0:47:32.520000::you, you know, you disqualify yourself by being all knowledgeable on the subject and bias.
0:47:32.520000 - 0:47:36.440000::And so I just like wrote an essay as long as I could about how Takashi snitched and how
0:47:36.440000 - 0:47:41.720000::I was so whatever, like, you know, had all these opinions about the drama.
0:47:41.720000 - 0:47:45.280000::And then I still got the $50 for going in.
0:47:45.280000 - 0:47:46.280000::Okay.
0:47:46.280000 - 0:47:47.280000::Wow.

0:47:51.080000 - 0:47:55.520000::And then I flip that shit into two Funko pops and then wait a year and then sell that shit.
0:47:55.520000 - 0:47:56.520000::And then I buy them.
0:47:56.520000 - 0:47:58.720000::By the way, what is a racketeering?
0:47:58.720000 - 0:48:02.720000::That feels like a whole like nineteen forty years ago.

0:48:07.560000 - 0:48:12.200000::Racketeering bro is being in a gang.

0:48:57.720000 - 0:49:01.360000::They steal your shit and on top of that, you also have to be worried about something called
0:49:01.360000 - 0:49:02.360000::the Yakuza.
0:49:02.360000 - 0:49:04.640000::Ooh, I know, I know about that.
0:49:04.640000 - 0:49:08.040000::I just wanted to warn you in case you didn't there.
0:49:08.040000 - 0:49:10.920000::Those might be the most fun gang to chill with.
0:49:10.920000 - 0:49:12.680000::That might be the most fun gang to chill with.
0:49:12.680000 - 0:49:16.720000::If you could speak their language, which I could with translator, you know what I mean?
0:49:16.720000 - 0:49:17.720000::Go over.
0:49:17.720000 - 0:49:21.720000::Try to get on that do a lepa app to learn Japanese like it.
0:49:21.720000 - 0:49:30::So I don't got to watch dub the hint I had in the morning.
0:49:30 - 0:49:32.160000::I think the Yakuza is still real, right?
0:49:32.160000 - 0:49:33.640000::Or my mistaken.
0:49:33.640000 - 0:49:35.480000::They're still fucking powerful.
0:49:35.480000 - 0:49:36.480000::Yeah.
0:49:36.480000 - 0:49:37.480000::Yeah.
0:49:37.480000 - 0:49:40.280000::And then what's the gang from China that try ads?
0:49:40.280000 - 0:49:41.280000::Try ad?
0:49:41.280000 - 0:49:42.280000::Yep.
0:49:42.280000 - 0:49:43.280000::I don't know.
0:49:43.280000 - 0:49:44.280000::I don't know.
0:49:44.280000 - 0:49:45.280000::So as I talk about this shit.
0:49:45.280000 - 0:49:46.280000::Yeah, man.
0:49:46.280000 - 0:49:53.420000::So remember earlier when I mentioned MS-13, let's just say most of my house is being banged
0:49:53.420000 - 0:49:55.080000::on right now ever since then.
0:49:55.080000 - 0:49:59::So I don't think that we should continue mentioning these guys.

0:50:00 - 0:50:17::So I guess not to like circle back too far, but I guess how would you you know we're talking about gangs and you know ISIS is probably like you know one of the one of the top gangs right now although they're kind of they're going down their stars kind of their star meters kind of dropping a bit.
0:50:17 - 0:50:26::But what would you rather be beheaded by ISIS or eating the live by tiger you know answer my old is the workers question wow.
0:50:26 - 0:50:28::I S I S.
0:50:28 - 0:50:34::Because I don't know if I want my death to be politicized necessarily.
0:50:34 - 0:50:37::I definitely don't want that unless it's for the right cause.
0:50:37 - 0:50:39::Yeah, unless it's for the right cause.
0:50:39 - 0:50:55::Do you get to pick where I mean like if if fucking Joe Biden ever tries to make IPA's illegal I'm going to do a January 6th on the fucking White House and if I get sniped then that I'm willing to do that.
0:50:55 - 0:50:59::Wait, if you could stop all violence by being beheaded.
0:50:59 - 0:51:02::Would you do that.
0:51:02 - 0:51:03::It's pretty noble.
0:51:03 - 0:51:08::I would have to do it like today or could I like you could do it on your birthday, but that's the latest.
0:51:08 - 0:51:12::Okay, I want to spend a little money first.
0:51:12 - 0:51:18::I need to rack up that $12,000 limit on my fucking chase unlimited.
0:51:18 - 0:51:26::Could it be a thing where like yeah ISIS can be had me but only of Daniel Radcliffe joins ISIS and it's him.
0:51:26 - 0:51:28::You see what I'm saying.
0:51:28 - 0:51:30::You want to do it today.
0:51:30 - 0:51:33::I'd like the wizard to do it.
0:51:33 - 0:51:35::I was there.
0:51:35 - 0:51:38::Say some say some spell rep before he does it.
0:51:38 - 0:51:39::Yeah, I'm fine.
0:51:39 - 0:51:46::I'm not sure if you would you pay to get Daniel Radcliffe back in the Harry Potter franchise as an adult spin off series HBO.
0:51:46 - 0:51:47::God damn.
0:51:47 - 0:51:56::I mean, I would I would unload my entire crypto wallet just to make that happen.
0:51:56 - 0:51:58::Professor Harold where he comes back.
0:51:58 - 0:52:03::He's a substitute teacher at a regular school teaching them what it was like back in the mountains.
0:52:03 - 0:52:05::Back in the wizarding mountains.
0:52:05 - 0:52:07::Yeah, right.
0:52:07 - 0:52:10::Yeah, right.
0:52:10 - 0:52:12::Yeah, right.
0:52:12 - 0:52:15::So then what's funny is.
0:52:15 - 0:52:17::Huh.
0:52:17 - 0:52:18::Huh.
0:52:18 - 0:52:21::I was gonna say Harry Potter.
0:52:21 - 0:52:28::Y'all they need to they need to make a Harry Potter.
0:52:28 - 0:52:30::But.
0:52:30 - 0:52:32::Liquid.
0:52:32 - 0:52:33::Liquid. Yeah.
0:52:33 - 0:52:34::Thank you.
0:52:34 - 0:52:36::Yeah, you want to drink it.
0:52:36 - 0:52:38::Yeah, I want to drink liquid Harry Potter.
0:52:38 - 0:52:44::Remember, remember Bob Marley had the Melo Mootie for a while.
0:52:44 - 0:52:46::We need to quit it.
0:52:46 - 0:52:49::Yeah, I want some Harry Potter bubble tea.
0:52:49 - 0:52:55::Harry Potter, Boba Harry Potter, Boba Harry Potter, Harry Potter, new highest level of Buffalo Wild Wings.
0:52:55 - 0:53:00::Wicked the most wizard, wizardly, wizardly heat.
0:53:00 - 0:53:03::And then we do.
0:53:03 - 0:53:05::I will tell you the order on it.
0:53:05 - 0:53:07::It's getting too creative.
0:53:07 - 0:53:11::We bring up Harry Potter on about every episode and people are getting tired of it.
0:53:11 - 0:53:13::They're down right sick of it.
0:53:13 - 0:53:17::And it's basically always me bringing it up, but I can't help it.
0:53:17 - 0:53:22::Well, I think JK Rowling loves to go on how one's just to.
0:53:22 - 0:53:25::As punishment for some of her backward.
0:53:25 - 0:53:26::I think that's.
0:53:26 - 0:53:27::Can I just say this?
0:53:27 - 0:53:29::I mean, it'd be the beginning of her punishment.
0:53:29 - 0:53:31::And then I think it should get more crazy from.
0:53:31 - 0:53:34::I don't want to get into the details, but yeah, more crazy from there.
0:53:34 - 0:53:39::She should have to do the cat Williams gauntlet basketball one on one basketball full court.
0:53:39 - 0:53:41::A night of stand up comedy.
0:53:41 - 0:53:44::And then what else did he say?
0:53:44 - 0:53:46::The sprint.
0:53:46 - 0:53:49::Yeah, he challenged freestyle Kevin Hart.
0:53:49 - 0:53:50::Right.
0:53:50 - 0:53:51::All right.
0:53:51 - 0:53:56::She should go up against what's their name Suzanne Collins who wrote the Hunger Games to see who can make it out.
0:53:56 - 0:53:58::Out on top.
0:53:58 - 0:54:02::What was your Dan?
0:54:02 - 0:54:05::What was your GPA in high school?
0:54:05 - 0:54:08::Oh, that's a good question.
0:54:08 - 0:54:10::It was in the high twos.
0:54:10 - 0:54:11::I think.
0:54:11 - 0:54:12::Yes.
0:54:12 - 0:54:13::Two night.
0:54:13 - 0:54:14::Yeah.

0:54:19 - 0:54:21::What did you have Nate?
0:54:21 - 0:54:25::I think I ended up with like a three four or five.
0:54:25 - 0:54:26::I think I was.
0:54:26 - 0:54:27::I think I was.
0:54:27 - 0:54:28::I think I was.
0:54:28 - 0:54:29::I think I was.
0:54:29 - 0:54:30::I think I was.
0:54:30 - 0:54:31::Was that weighted or unweighted?
0:54:31 - 0:54:32::I don't know what.
0:54:32 - 0:54:33::What does that mean weighted?
0:54:33 - 0:54:37::Well, curiously, you don't know this weighted means with you're taking the advanced classes.
0:54:37 - 0:54:38::I was not.
0:54:38 - 0:54:40::I was not in one single.
0:54:40 - 0:54:44::You're talking about eight p classes or I b right?
0:54:44 - 0:54:46::Yeah, I wasn't in none of that.
0:54:46 - 0:54:48::I was with the real people, dude.
0:54:48 - 0:54:54::Well, I was in that I b program and I was the dumbest one easily.
0:54:54 - 0:54:57::So I had about a two nine, but.
0:54:57 - 0:54:59::Wait, it did that's about a three.

0:55:00 - 0:55:07.280000::You got a two nine. Yeah. Yeah. I got a deep plus in special ed English freshman year high school.
0:55:07.280000 - 0:55:14.560000::But deep plus. Yeah. We used to do something called test survivor where you would don't fill out
0:55:14.560000 - 0:55:20::any of the answers of the test and see who can last the longest before the teacher gets mad
0:55:20 - 0:55:24.880000::and makes you finish it. You know what I'm saying? And then you just write down what the rep felt like.
0:55:25.840000 - 0:55:30.080000::Yeah. Well, like, or you would just turn your test in but it'd be like who could say
0:55:30.080000 - 0:55:37.120000::here the longest it makes school go crazy along. Wow. They would drug test us and if you tested
0:55:37.120000 - 0:55:45.600000::positive for weed, they would take a full point off your GPA. No, no. But that's cool. I'm just
0:55:45.600000 - 0:55:57.920000::playing. Yeah. Yeah. Monosauri school rules. Monosauri, they want extra drugs. Yeah. Exactly. That's

0:56:49.280000 - 0:56:55.600000::for the 90s type movies, 90s time. You know what I'm saying? They don't we were just the whole time.
0:56:55.600000 - 0:57:00.720000::We were just saying they don't make them like this anymore. And they certainly don't. So shot. If
0:57:00.720000 - 0:57:06.160000::you guys haven't seen frequency, go watch that shit. Have you seen it? Has anyone seen an enemy
0:57:06.480000 - 0:57:13.600000::mine with Dennis Koyde with the alien one. Yeah. All right.
0:57:16.480000 - 0:57:21.360000::Never mind. But it's going to be on the watch list. Thumbs up. Thumbs up. And it's weird.
0:57:22.400000 - 0:57:25.440000::He falls in love with the alien the whole time. Freaky lizard alien.
0:57:27.200000 - 0:57:34.640000::You see that man. What's it called? Splice where Adrian Brody folks to like the splice?
0:57:35.360000 - 0:57:44.560000::No. What's the splice? The splice is like half human half alien.
0:57:46.480000 - 0:57:50.560000::But it looks all fucked up. You know like when you do the photo, both thing and it like
0:57:51.360000 - 0:57:56.560000::it doesn't the mirror of your face. Your eyes are like on the opposite side of your head and
0:57:56.560000 - 0:58:00.960000::shit. The splice kind of looks like that. And oh fuck. He should fucks the splice.
0:58:00.960000 - 0:58:07.600000::Is it a splice? Yeah. Or just a splice. Yeah. There's a little, it's a little bit incestuous
0:58:07.600000 - 0:58:14.720000::because it does have some of his journey. All right. So movie night is frequency, splice and an enemy
0:58:14.720000 - 0:58:21.920000::mine. Yeah. Triple feature. Sounds amazing. A marathon. Yes, please. Sleep over party. We're doing it.

0:58:32.400000 - 0:58:38.480000::I've been writing now. I've been writing letters to CBS every week. It's like first off,
0:58:39.520000 - 0:58:43.680000::bring back James Corden. And if you're not going to give him his time slot back, Jalen,
0:58:43.680000 - 0:58:49.440000::no style, at least bring back hardweight. Hardweight. Just a monologue. Just kind of like a dick-cabit style,
0:58:49.440000 - 0:58:53.520000::Chris Hardwick show where he just comes out. You know, I'm saying it's quiet. It's about three
0:58:53.520000 - 0:59:01.840000::hours long. Yeah. Yes. The serious questions. And well, you know what gave me joy this week is
0:59:03.360000 - 0:59:10.560000::I honestly it was watching Dan Special. Wow. It was so fun. I was very, I was so stoked
0:59:11.280000 - 0:59:17.760000::since I heard about the idea of it. I was like just pumped, so pumped for whatever,
0:59:18.480000 - 0:59:21.440000::whatever you started the pro. When did you shoot it? In
0:59:21.440000 - 0:59:31.840000::shot at August of 2023. So, but I had this idea for several years. And yeah, I've been
0:59:33.200000 - 0:59:36.240000::I've been pretty much like working on this for like, I'd say,
0:59:37.440000 - 0:59:43.280000::13, 14 months or some shit. So yeah. Yeah. I remember I heard it maybe through the great
0:59:43.280000 - 0:59:50::fine of like through Harris or something. But I was like, this is the funniest idea ever.
0:59:50 - 0:59:58.320000::And it was it was truly, truly so so fucking good. And man, one of the best specials to come out
0:59:58.320000 - 0:59:59.920000::in in a while. Like

1:00:00 - 1:00:03.540000::Cool Nate, I guess you're like trying to get in the writers room or some shit like
1:00:05.440000 - 1:00:09.800000::Showed yeah nicely weird is how happens man
1:00:12.600000 - 1:00:15.680000::Yeah, I'm really trying to I'm trying to
1:00:17.880000 - 1:00:19.880000::Try to get in as many
1:00:20.520000 - 1:00:24.800000::Writer's rooms as possible. I'm trying to get rehired at SNL if they'll have me back
1:00:24.800000 - 1:00:30.400000::I didn't actually go to Harvard, but maybe that you
1:00:33.400000 - 1:00:37.440000::Do what did you set did you tell everybody that you went to Harvard there? Oh
1:00:39.640000 - 1:00:41.640000::I should have I
1:00:42 - 1:00:48.680000::Did do a lot of things there though that probably probably led to me getting fired like one day in the writers room
1:00:48.680000 - 1:00:54.480000::Just before every single thing I pitched I just went no will be so funny
1:00:54.800000 - 1:00:56.800000::No
1:00:59 - 1:01:01.960000::I kept pitching that people I was like
1:01:02.360000 - 1:01:06.160000::You know it would be a good idea if we changed this character's name to
1:01:06.720000 - 1:01:08.800000::Brandon Wardell so
1:01:08.800000 - 1:01:10.800000::Shout out to Brandon
1:01:10.800000 - 1:01:17.280000::I just thought it'd be funny if like all the characters it is and on the show just happened to be named Brandon Wardell
1:01:17.280000 - 1:01:22.560000::Shad was as Lauren just looking down at his paper or what was his ass doing?
1:01:23.560000 - 1:01:31.120000::Yeah, I very limited interactions with Lauren, but yeah, you know, I was trying to befriend his son real bad
1:01:31.120000 - 1:01:37.240000::So we you know he's got a son figure if you got a son I figure if I get tight with his son
1:01:37.560000 - 1:01:41.600000::Yeah, then I get the fucking green light to do whatever I want
1:01:42.360000 - 1:01:45.560000::Don't work out like that. Shit. Are you?
1:01:45.840000 - 1:01:47.840000::Yeah, damn it

1:01:50.400000 - 1:01:58.480000::Is bad, but maybe it's actually somehow the 50th year unions coming around this year and who knows dude
1:01:58.480000 - 1:02:02.400000::You might be the only writer next season who knows I don't know these things work
