0:00:00 - 0:00:03::You have now answered.
0:00:03 - 0:00:05::You have now answered.
0:00:05 - 0:00:06::What did you say?
0:00:06 - 0:00:14::Welcome to Joy Tactics, the podcast dedicated to all things joyful, joyous, and meeting as many celebrities as humanly possible.
0:00:14 - 0:00:19::Hosted by Eric Rahill, Nate Veroni, and Jack Bensinger.
0:00:19 - 0:00:20::Enjoy.
0:00:22 - 0:00:24::Ron DeSantis dropped out of the race.
0:00:24 - 0:00:25::Yeah.
0:00:25 - 0:00:27::Something must be different. You've never seen a world like this.
0:00:27 - 0:00:29::You didn't see this coming.
0:00:29 - 0:00:32::It took us all by a crazy ass surprise.
0:00:32 - 0:00:34::DeSantis out.
0:00:34 - 0:00:39::And just shortly after Vivek Ramaswamy, we thought there's no way he's going to drop out of the race.
0:00:39 - 0:00:42::He's too intellectual. He's too bulletproof.
0:00:42 - 0:00:46::Something mysterious is at play, I believe.
0:00:46 - 0:00:50::And his name is Nate.
0:00:50 - 0:00:52::His name is what? What do you think?
0:00:52 - 0:00:54::What do you think we're getting?
0:00:54 - 0:00:56::I'm just learning right now.
0:00:56 - 0:00:59::I don't know anything that's going on in the political sphere.
0:00:59 - 0:01:02::This is a more of an educational podcast for me.
0:01:02 - 0:01:04::Okay. I'll give you a hint.
0:01:04 - 0:01:07::He was the 40th president.
0:01:07 - 0:01:10::I had to think of a tattoo Eric has on his leg.
0:01:10 - 0:01:13::Oh, yeah. You had to describe that, Eric.
0:01:13 - 0:01:16::Okay. I haven't told this on here before.
0:01:16 - 0:01:18::I don't think so. This is so good.
0:01:18 - 0:01:21::How have you not?
0:01:21 - 0:01:25::My first tattoo, my friend Cole Nagel gave it to me.
0:01:25 - 0:01:30::When I was 21, I went home to Seattle.
0:01:30 - 0:01:32::And he gave me a stick and poke.
0:01:32 - 0:01:35::This is when these were becoming all the rage.
0:01:35 - 0:01:37::Okay. I would say.
0:01:37 - 0:01:41::And it's about 2013.
0:01:41 - 0:01:44::And I couldn't think of one single thing to get tattooed on my body.
0:01:44 - 0:01:47::So everybody, he tattooed a couple of other friends first.
0:01:47 - 0:01:49::And then it came to me and I thought, well,
0:01:49 - 0:01:55::you know what has given me joy, joy tactics style in my college years.
0:01:55 - 0:01:58::Well, to be frank, it's my improv team.
0:01:58 - 0:02:01::And these are some of my closest friends on the planet.
0:02:01 - 0:02:06::I have so much fun doing improv with them at my college.
0:02:06 - 0:02:09::Let me just get that team name tattooed on me.
0:02:09 - 0:02:14::And well, the team name was and still is the 45 King.
0:02:14 - 0:02:21::So the tattoo is a 45 with a crown above it.
0:02:21 - 0:02:23::That is so fucking fun.
0:02:23 - 0:02:27::I mean, it's like, it's like if your improv team was like,
0:02:27 - 0:02:31::like super fucking, you know, like the initials SS and you didn't know,
0:02:31 - 0:02:33::like, right.
0:02:33 - 0:02:36::Then later on, improv team in the 30s and the 1930s.
0:02:36 - 0:02:37::I know.
0:02:37 - 0:02:39::And then the SS came around and he's like, God damn it.
0:02:39 - 0:02:42::You know what I'm seeing happening here is you're living in some like,
0:02:42 - 0:02:47::you remember when you had that, you still have this hat, but the Pittsburgh Pirates hat.
0:02:47 - 0:02:49::Yeah, it's kind of like it's kind of probably.
0:02:49 - 0:02:54::Yeah, I'm sensing this is like could be like a curb your enthusiasm episode where they're like,
0:02:54 - 0:02:59::it could be the hat and then they see the tattoo and.
0:02:59 - 0:03:02::I get arrested for the insurrection style stuff.
0:03:02 - 0:03:06::No, but to tie it all up, the 40 if no one's putting two and two together,
0:03:06 - 0:03:11::Donald Trump, 45th president, there's a lot of 45 insignias across the country.
0:03:11 - 0:03:14::Now for the for the far right heads.
0:03:14 - 0:03:20::And so it looks like I have a kind of Donald Trump style swastika up on my thigh.
0:03:20 - 0:03:25::Yeah, and I thought maybe I'll remove it, but nobody will no one's catching clock in that.
0:03:25 - 0:03:31::It's except for one person did say like, oh, are you rocking with Trump?
0:03:31 - 0:03:34::And you were like, yeah, like, that's on your business.
0:03:34 - 0:03:36::Not as a person, but politically.
0:03:36 - 0:03:38::Politics here. Nobody's business.
0:03:38 - 0:03:41::We need to go back to those days where politics is nobody's business.
0:03:41 - 0:03:43::Just get your work done.
0:03:43 - 0:03:46::Raise your family, say for a time and then die.
0:03:46 - 0:03:49::That's all you need to do in this country.
0:03:49 - 0:03:50::You don't need to know my politics.
0:03:50 - 0:03:55::My politics with an amazing astound you and confuse you.
0:03:55 - 0:03:56::Why?
0:03:56 - 0:03:58::You saying that's your kids over dinner?
0:03:58 - 0:03:59::Oh, really?
0:03:59 - 0:04:00::You want to ask me about Palestine?
0:04:00 - 0:04:01::You fool.
0:04:01 - 0:04:02::Yeah.
0:04:02 - 0:04:04::You flick some pizza them on a spoon.
0:04:04 - 0:04:07::You can't even imagine my stance on that.
0:04:07 - 0:04:08::So complex.
0:04:08 - 0:04:11::Switching every day, I wake up on the Democrat.
0:04:11 - 0:04:12::I'm a lunch.
0:04:12 - 0:04:13::I'm a conservative.
0:04:13 - 0:04:14::I go to bed.
0:04:14 - 0:04:16::I'm communist.
0:04:16 - 0:04:18::And I have a bloody nose right now.
0:04:18 - 0:04:19::Oh, yeah.
0:04:19 - 0:04:24::If you're not looking at the video, I have what looks to be...
0:04:24 - 0:04:25::I don't know.
0:04:25 - 0:04:32::There's a lot of creative interpretations of what this could look like, but it's to put it frankly, a tissue is in my left nostril.
0:04:32 - 0:04:41::I repeat, a tissue has entered my left nostril in order to block the blood which has been excruciating from my nose.
0:04:41 - 0:04:42::Excruiting?
0:04:42 - 0:04:44::I don't know.
0:04:44 - 0:04:46::Exc...extruding?
0:04:46 - 0:04:48::And I don't want to...
0:04:48 - 0:04:52::I never want to shame either of you and I try my best to not shame you.
0:04:52 - 0:04:53::Here we go.
0:04:53 - 0:04:54::But something...
0:04:54 - 0:04:55::Here we go.
0:04:55 - 0:05:00::There's something about a tissue shoved up a nose or anything hanging out.

0:05:00 - 0:05:04.760000::of our orifices that just makes me sick to look at.
0:05:04.760000 - 0:05:06.520000::And it just makes me feel sad for you
0:05:06.520000 - 0:05:08.440000::that you have that in your face right now.
0:05:08.440000 - 0:05:09.760000::Tissue off in your nose.
0:05:09.760000 - 0:05:11.480000::Can't even smell normally.
0:05:11.480000 - 0:05:13.680000::Well bitch, that's how I feel.
0:05:13.680000 - 0:05:16.080000::You know what's coming out of your orifices right now?
0:05:16.080000 - 0:05:16.920000::What?
0:05:16.920000 - 0:05:17.840000::That's a way more embarrassing.
0:05:17.840000 - 0:05:18.680000::What?
0:05:18.680000 - 0:05:20.680000::Close-minded vocabulary.
0:05:20.680000 - 0:05:22::Oh.
0:05:22 - 0:05:22.840000::Yatchia.
0:05:25.840000 - 0:05:27.680000::That's kind of the, remember that video
0:05:27.680000 - 0:05:29.360000::where that guy's like, don't make me say,
0:05:29.360000 - 0:05:31.520000::I really don't want to say it.
0:05:31.520000 - 0:05:33.600000::I'm glad you broke your arm.
0:05:33.600000 - 0:05:37.440000::Remember that kid, Nate?
0:05:37.440000 - 0:05:40.080000::I actually don't think I've seen that one.
0:05:40.080000 - 0:05:42.960000::But I have seen this video that you sent
0:05:42.960000 - 0:05:45.640000::to the twitch active thread.
0:05:45.640000 - 0:05:46.920000::We gotta talk about this.
0:05:46.920000 - 0:05:49.200000::This is, it's at a twerking competition.
0:05:49.200000 - 0:05:50.600000::Do we think it's real?
0:05:50.600000 - 0:05:51.440000::We gotta edit you.
0:05:51.440000 - 0:05:52.280000::We gotta edit you.
0:05:52.280000 - 0:05:53.640000::Oh, that's 100% real.
0:05:53.640000 - 0:05:54.800000::There's no way.
0:05:54.800000 - 0:05:58.840000::So a woman is twerking upon a man that is laying down,
0:05:58.840000 - 0:06:02.440000::basically just fully laid out on a platform.
0:06:02.440000 - 0:06:03.560000::And she's rocking it.
0:06:03.560000 - 0:06:05.160000::She's doing amazing.
0:06:05.160000 - 0:06:08.720000::And well, what happens?
0:06:08.720000 - 0:06:10.400000::And there's announcers too.
0:06:10.400000 - 0:06:12.240000::Oh yeah, and it's Hello people.
0:06:12.240000 - 0:06:15.720000::It looks like the spot from Spider-Man 1,
0:06:15.720000 - 0:06:18::that Spider-Man crazy cage fight.
0:06:18 - 0:06:19.440000::It's like that type of environment.
0:06:19.440000 - 0:06:22.040000::But in the ring is a twerking competition.
0:06:22.040000 - 0:06:24.520000::And a man is getting twerked upon.
0:06:24.520000 - 0:06:26.680000::And basically he's wearing light colored pants
0:06:26.680000 - 0:06:27.840000::and he busts.
0:06:29.240000 - 0:06:30.960000::He's in the allegedly.
0:06:30.960000 - 0:06:33.800000::And you see the, you can see it quite clearly
0:06:33.800000 - 0:06:35.960000::through the pants a little stain.
0:06:35.960000 - 0:06:38.680000::And it's basically, and everybody sees it.
0:06:38.680000 - 0:06:40.400000::And they're going crazy.
0:06:40.400000 - 0:06:42.480000::And the guy's kind of, am I wrong?
0:06:42.480000 - 0:06:43.680000::But is he kind of posing with it?
0:06:43.680000 - 0:06:46.600000::Is he kind of going like, he's framing it up?
0:06:46.600000 - 0:06:48::No, I think he's like, yeah.
0:06:48 - 0:06:48.840000::Embarrassed.
0:06:48.840000 - 0:06:52.760000::I feel like that's a basically a 10 out of a 10 out of 10 score.
0:06:52.760000 - 0:06:54.720000::But why does it get up and move?
0:06:54.720000 - 0:06:57.720000::Like it seemed a little bit like he's doing like the like,
0:06:58.960000 - 0:07:03.080000::yo, like, I'm now, I'm the newest member of the Rockefeller team.
0:07:03.080000 - 0:07:06.040000::But in a way where he's just nutted in his jeans.
0:07:06.040000 - 0:07:08.680000::But he's doing stoked on it.
0:07:08.680000 - 0:07:10.600000::Well, the most incriminating thing you could do there
0:07:10.600000 - 0:07:12.160000::is to try to hide it.
0:07:12.160000 - 0:07:13.160000::You know what I mean?
0:07:13.160000 - 0:07:14.600000::You know, like when Liam Neeson
0:07:14.600000 - 0:07:16.760000::pisses his pants at like a red carpet event
0:07:16.760000 - 0:07:19.120000::and he's just walking around, no fucking problem.
0:07:19.120000 - 0:07:19.960000::What?
0:07:19.960000 - 0:07:21.720000::That's the most confident thing you could do.
0:07:21.720000 - 0:07:23.480000::He did that.
0:07:23.480000 - 0:07:25.560000::I don't want to call him out, but it's pretty known
0:07:25.560000 - 0:07:27.800000::that he sometimes is being his pants.
0:07:27.800000 - 0:07:30.920000::Liam Neeson from Taken and Shana Wills list.
0:07:30.920000 - 0:07:33.240000::He should be taken to the candy shop for that.
0:07:33.240000 - 0:07:34.800000::Take me to that candy.
0:07:34.800000 - 0:07:38.320000::That this person got taken to the candy shop in his pants.
0:07:38.320000 - 0:07:41.200000::That crowd reminded me so much of Nate.
0:07:41.200000 - 0:07:42.040000::I know.
0:07:42.040000 - 0:07:42.880000::Everybody just being like,
0:07:42.880000 - 0:07:47.240000::Oh, I imagine Nate being the lung in.
0:07:47.240000 - 0:07:49.200000::Oh, Nate was in that crowd.
0:07:49.200000 - 0:07:52.200000::Nate, you would, if you were getting torn down
0:07:52.200000 - 0:07:54.720000::in a torque competition, I feel like you would have been going
0:07:54.720000 - 0:07:55.560000::away too hard.
0:07:55.560000 - 0:07:56.640000::I was like the receiver.
0:07:56.640000 - 0:07:59.120000::You'd be like, oh, like fasting so hard.
0:07:59.120000 - 0:07:59.960000::Yeah.
0:07:59.960000 - 0:08:03.040000::Yeah, it's not a good get off.
0:08:03.040000 - 0:08:07.440000::That's so it's so reminiscent of the Janet Jackson.
0:08:07.440000 - 0:08:08.440000::Yes.
0:08:08.440000 - 0:08:11.960000::Which is my favorite video, maybe a lot of time.
0:08:11.960000 - 0:08:12.800000::Can you explain that?
0:08:12.800000 - 0:08:14.600000::Yeah, Nate, please.
0:08:14.600000 - 0:08:15.480000::This is OK.
0:08:15.480000 - 0:08:19.160000::So Janet Jackson is in like an arena style,
0:08:19.160000 - 0:08:22.840000::like somewhere in America doing a concert in an arena.
0:08:22.840000 - 0:08:25.520000::And I don't know if she does this every show on this tour,
0:08:25.520000 - 0:08:34.120000::but there's this platform that somebody is strapped into standing up.
0:08:34.120000 - 0:08:36.240000::They're like their hands are chied, tied up,
0:08:36.240000 - 0:08:38.600000::their feet are tied up.
0:08:38.600000 - 0:08:42.640000::And they're just frozen on this kind of gurney almost,
0:08:42.640000 - 0:08:46.160000::like a structure type metallic thing.
0:08:46.160000 - 0:08:51.720000::And Janet Jackson is just moving,
0:08:51.720000 - 0:08:54.080000::touching this guy and singing.
0:08:54.080000 - 0:08:59.240000::And this dude is like fucking hyperventilating, freaking out.
0:08:59.240000 - 0:09:03.880000::So can I turn on slash shot in star straight?
0:09:03.880000 - 0:09:05.480000::He's just turned by the music.
0:09:05.480000 - 0:09:08.520000::I don't think he's turned on by the fandom.
0:09:08.520000 - 0:09:09.520000::Yeah.
0:09:09.520000 - 0:09:11.040000::By the first thing.
0:09:11.040000 - 0:09:13.040000::Yeah.
0:09:13.040000 - 0:09:15.520000::He's excited, classically excited.
0:09:15.520000 - 0:09:19.480000::What I'm finding right now is we need to turn this into a fucking full stop,
0:09:19.480000 - 0:09:21.960000::fucking Tosh.0 style clip show.
0:09:21.960000 - 0:09:24.840000::Yeah, we're describing so we're just describing internet videos.
0:09:24.840000 - 0:09:25.840000::No problem.
0:09:25.840000 - 0:09:29.200000::And then we have them on for a web redemption and we twerk on them.
0:09:29.200000 - 0:09:33.040000::Nate, who would be that artist for you?

0:16:54.200000 - 0:16:59.320000::have learned to not doubt. He's been right about a lot and he liked and he plays music. And
0:16:59.320000 - 0:17:05.240000::well, he was talking about there is a pyramid in Alaska. Have you heard of this? Of course.
0:17:05.240000 - 0:17:13.560000::No. What? No. There could be a there. It's all snow. It's but it's yeah. Correct. But what's
0:17:13.560000 - 0:17:21.560000::underneath that pyramid? A pyramid pyramid. I don't know. Okay. Anyways, he was like, what is
0:17:21.560000 - 0:17:30.280000::the function of these pyramids? Their batteries. They are lowering the consciousness of human beings.
0:17:31.400000 - 0:17:35.640000::So if you felt so that so you know what I'm saying? We're all feeling something. If you can see
0:17:35.640000 - 0:17:39.720000::we're we're we're all feeling like, damn, I feel like a little something feels a little bit
0:17:39.720000 - 0:17:46.600000::different. You know, I'm saying our consciousness is being fucking siphoned by the Alaskan pyramids.
0:17:46.600000 - 0:17:52.040000::Dude, that's why that's why you're sick right now, man. It's because we're on a prison colony
0:17:52.040000 - 0:17:58.520000::right now. Prison planet. They take all the misbehaving. Basically, I think every person on earth
0:17:58.520000 - 0:18:04.520000::participated in some type of international heist, some type of horrible crime. Of course. And we've
0:18:04.520000 - 0:18:08.920000::been sentenced to this three dimensional space. We're usually four dimensional five,
0:18:08.920000 - 0:18:14.920000::D 60 beings. And now we have to live life wondering what type of cheese cracker we're going to get next.
0:18:14.920000 - 0:18:19.400000::Let me show you. Talk about pasta water. Yeah, let me show you my notebooks.
0:18:19.400000 - 0:18:25.560000::Let me show you my notebooks because in 2010, 2011, I had my first gravity mong ever. And I
0:18:25.560000 - 0:18:30.600000::realized this conclusion quickly as hell sitting on the porch in North Carolina. I realized, oh,
0:18:31.320000 - 0:18:37.560000::how come it is whenever I laugh, it's because I'm getting too close to something very serious,
0:18:37.560000 - 0:18:42.920000::right? And I could just tell in that moment that I'm in a vat of basically, I'm not, you don't have
0:18:42.920000 - 0:18:48.920000::human shape. We are liquid. And in another dimension, you are in a vat basically like a fish tank.
0:18:48.920000 - 0:18:53.240000::And they're signaling the people who have us captured are signaling all the little neuron
0:18:53.240000 - 0:18:59.160000::and verticeses to activate at certain points. We are in an intergalactic war. Your human body is
0:18:59.160000 - 0:19:03.080000::your prison. And the only way to get out is to fucking kill yourself. And you have a duty to do it
0:19:03.080000 - 0:19:10.200000::so that you can get back into the battlefield rip open the aliens next. Why do you think Robin Williams
0:19:10.200000 - 0:19:14.600000::was seven back to the fucking battlefield? He's the fucking super soldier. He was low. You know how close
0:19:14.600000 - 0:19:20.600000::he was to. Oh, you know who the Titans are? Robin Williams of VG and motherfucking Chris. Well,
0:19:20.600000 - 0:19:28.520000::Chris. He's next. He's the last one. Is the commander. He's kind of the general. He's like the
0:19:28.520000 - 0:19:36.200000::one of you. I want to see cat Williams fucking in the in the top ranking military officer of
0:19:36.200000 - 0:19:41.480000::country. I want to see the army and just what he can do with with some troops. If we give him,
0:19:41.480000 - 0:19:46.440000::if we give him 20,000 bodies to just he goes straight to the White House. If cat was
0:19:46.440000 - 0:19:52.760000::immediately was commanding a a buried mech suit. You know what I'm saying? He finds the mech
0:19:52.840000 - 0:19:57.400000::suit. He's operating it. He's like, it's taking this fucking
0:19:57.400000 - 0:19:59.880000::spring Steve Harvey's house. Crush his face.

0:20:00 - 0:20:05::Steve's already had with a cat William Gundam.
0:20:05.160000 - 0:20:07.480000::Cat William sliding down the outside of a Gundam.
0:20:07.480000 - 0:20:09.720000::I killed you all and then he slides out the eyeball,
0:20:09.720000 - 0:20:11.120000::slides down the whole body.
0:20:11.120000 - 0:20:13.080000::We're just doing it.
0:20:13.080000 - 0:20:15.440000::The Ronald Gunn is like cooling down, it's all red.
0:20:15.440000 - 0:20:16.280000::Yeah.
0:20:16.280000 - 0:20:17.120000::Yeah.
0:20:19.120000 - 0:20:19.960000::Oh my God.
0:20:19.960000 - 0:20:21.880000::Imagine the man that was Cat Williams.
0:20:21.880000 - 0:20:26.640000::He's got it on autopilot and like fucking getting crazy head.
0:20:26.640000 - 0:20:27.640000::Oh my God.
0:20:28.360000 - 0:20:30.480000::Listen to the list of Mania cat Williams.
0:20:30.480000 - 0:20:32.520000::Listen to the list of Mania getting head in the pilot seat
0:20:32.520000 - 0:20:33.360000::in the next.
0:20:37.560000 - 0:20:38.400000::Oh my God.
0:20:38.400000 - 0:20:39.400000::Oh man.
0:20:39.400000 - 0:20:40.400000::Steve War can be.
0:20:40.400000 - 0:20:41.400000::I'm fine.
0:20:41.400000 - 0:20:42.400000::I'm fine.
0:20:42.400000 - 0:20:43.240000::They should.
0:20:43.240000 - 0:20:45.680000::Are they fucking on the space station international?
0:20:45.680000 - 0:20:47.320000::Because they're up there for 90 days.
0:20:47.320000 - 0:20:50.040000::You know, I think they configure the literally not kidding.
0:20:50.040000 - 0:20:51.600000::They get the most unattractive.
0:20:51.600000 - 0:20:54.200000::They figure out what your tastes are and then they hire someone
0:20:54.200000 - 0:20:56.480000::that's really the opposite.
0:20:56.480000 - 0:20:57.320000::You know what I'm saying?
0:20:57.320000 - 0:20:59.440000::Are you kidding me?
0:20:59.440000 - 0:21:00.800000::We're screwed.
0:21:00.800000 - 0:21:03.280000::So the fuck these ones are going to be the ones who survive
0:21:03.280000 - 0:21:05.400000::when the planet collides and do another planet
0:21:05.400000 - 0:21:07.160000::and the only people in the space station
0:21:07.160000 - 0:21:10.720000::are to busted ass fucking Chewbacca the Hut and whatever.
0:21:10.720000 - 0:21:11.520000::We're screwed.
0:21:11.520000 - 0:21:13.520000::They're going to think we were busted ass ugly.
0:21:13.520000 - 0:21:15::We need to get that spaceship out there
0:21:15 - 0:21:15.960000::with Ryan Reynolds in it.
0:21:15.960000 - 0:21:16.960000::Yo.
0:21:16.960000 - 0:21:18.880000::It's Ryan Reynolds realization.
0:21:18.880000 - 0:21:21.400000::You've come in days.
0:21:21.400000 - 0:21:22.240000::Evilongoria.
0:21:25.680000 - 0:21:26.200000::Yeah.
0:21:26.200000 - 0:21:27.640000::And some other ones.
0:21:27.640000 - 0:21:30.200000::Got one of those ones from start making babies.
0:21:30.200000 - 0:21:34.840000::Who's the girl from Chuck and Larry?
0:21:34.840000 - 0:21:36.200000::Jennifer Aniston.
0:21:36.200000 - 0:21:37.320000::No.
0:21:37.320000 - 0:21:38.360000::Who?
0:21:38.360000 - 0:21:39.120000::Jessica Beale.
0:21:39.120000 - 0:21:40.640000::I just remembered Ms. Beale.
0:21:40.640000 - 0:21:41.640000::Oh, for seven.
0:21:41.640000 - 0:21:45.440000::Jessica Beale on an intergalactic human-noid visual preservation
0:21:45.440000 - 0:21:47.360000::mission right now.
0:21:47.360000 - 0:21:51.360000::And I have some bad news about the guy you played the dad
0:21:51.360000 - 0:21:54.040000::in 7th heaven.
0:21:54.040000 - 0:21:55.400000::He broke his foot.
0:21:55.400000 - 0:21:56.160000::No.
0:21:56.160000 - 0:21:58.400000::Is that Robin Thicks, dad?
0:21:58.400000 - 0:22:01.240000::No, that was from growing, that's growing pains.
0:22:01.240000 - 0:22:01.960000::Oh, no.
0:22:01.960000 - 0:22:06.320000::The dad in 7th heaven growing pains is not a good man.
0:22:06.320000 - 0:22:07.280000::What's the bad guy?
0:22:07.280000 - 0:22:08.320000::Story.
0:22:08.320000 - 0:22:10.760000::I don't want to talk about it, but all right.
0:22:10.760000 - 0:22:12.960000::Well, there's that moving on, I guess.
0:22:12.960000 - 0:22:13.800000::He just brought it up.
0:22:13.800000 - 0:22:14.840000::He didn't want to talk about it.
0:22:14.840000 - 0:22:16.480000::Well, Jessica Beale was on 7th heaven.
0:22:16.480000 - 0:22:18.560000::I love the fuck out of that show.
0:22:18.560000 - 0:22:20.080000::It gave me seven heaven.
0:22:20.080000 - 0:22:20.600000::7th heaven.
0:22:20.600000 - 0:22:23.760000::Why in the world did they call it that?
0:22:23.760000 - 0:22:26.280000::That's something we will never know.
0:22:26.280000 - 0:22:26.880000::Good God.
0:22:26.880000 - 0:22:29.480000::Well, then I'll go fucking kill myself.
0:22:29.480000 - 0:22:30.840000::Let's bring the mood up.
0:22:30.840000 - 0:22:32.680000::Let's get back on track.
0:22:32.680000 - 0:22:34.520000::Back to the politics.
0:22:34.520000 - 0:22:35.760000::It's basically a lock right now.
0:22:35.760000 - 0:22:37.160000::It's Trump versus Nikki Haley.
0:22:37.160000 - 0:22:39.520000::That's what we're really talking about realistically right now.
0:22:39.520000 - 0:22:42.160000::And by the way, that is a match, which is not
0:22:42.160000 - 0:22:43.920000::hard to predict the outcome of, because Nikki Haley
0:22:43.920000 - 0:22:45.120000::is out of her fucking mind.
0:22:45.120000 - 0:22:46::That's for sure.
0:22:46 - 0:22:49::Maybe New Hampshire, I doubt it.
0:22:49 - 0:22:53.600000::Now, could we be seeing Nikki Haley Trump running
0:22:53.600000 - 0:22:55.200000::both on the same ticket?
0:22:55.200000 - 0:22:56.880000::How curious.
0:22:56.880000 - 0:22:58.640000::I could see that.
0:22:58.640000 - 0:23:01.960000::I don't think so, though, because Nikki Haley, I mean,
0:23:01.960000 - 0:23:05.080000::she's basically got two first names.
0:23:05.080000 - 0:23:06.160000::No one I'm saying.
0:23:06.160000 - 0:23:07.520000::Sounds like twins.
0:23:07.520000 - 0:23:09.080000::Sounds like Ricky Bobby.
0:23:09.080000 - 0:23:11.640000::Sounds like the female Ricky Bobby.
0:23:11.640000 - 0:23:12.320000::Nikki Haley.
0:23:12.320000 - 0:23:13.160000::Can I be honest?
0:23:13.160000 - 0:23:16.880000::I just found out about Ricky Haley yesterday.
0:23:16.880000 - 0:23:17.800000::I had never.
0:23:17.800000 - 0:23:21.400000::I'm like, do you guys know who that was?
0:23:21.400000 - 0:23:22.880000::Like before last week.
0:23:22.880000 - 0:23:25.120000::And that makes me realize there's a reason why we're
0:23:25.120000 - 0:23:27.280000::heading back to a Trump presidency.
0:23:27.280000 - 0:23:31.080000::Is the immediate liberal complacency.
0:23:31.080000 - 0:23:34.280000::How funny this is.
0:23:34.280000 - 0:23:35.080000::That we did a lot.
0:23:35.080000 - 0:23:38.160000::Political literacy is dying a slow and embarrassing death
0:23:38.160000 - 0:23:41.280000::in front of the entire world stage right now.
0:23:41.280000 - 0:23:41.880000::Democracy?
0:23:41.880000 - 0:23:42.840000::To the beings?
0:23:42.840000 - 0:23:43.760000::No, no.
0:23:43.760000 - 0:23:45.480000::Political literacy.
0:23:45.480000 - 0:23:47.640000::Oh, yep.
0:23:47.640000 - 0:23:50.160000::Yeah, I was in a class called Financial Literacies
0:23:50.160000 - 0:23:52.720000::with a guy named Hardin Cox.
0:23:52.720000 - 0:23:54.680000::And we had to we had a teacher.
0:23:54.680000 - 0:23:55.680000::That was a teacher.
0:23:55.680000 - 0:23:59.280000::No, that was a student of co-student of mine.
0:23:59.280000 - 0:24:01.160000::What did he look like?
0:24:01.160000 - 0:24:07.360000::He looked basically like he looks kind of like the smash
0:24:07.360000 - 0:24:08.360000::mouth guy to be honest.
0:24:08.360000 - 0:24:09.160000::Oh, really?
0:24:09.160000 - 0:24:09.680000::And he did.
0:24:09.680000 - 0:24:11.200000::Yeah, recently.
0:24:11.200000 - 0:24:12.800000::He was chosen as well.
0:24:12.800000 - 0:24:15.880000::He was chosen for the next battle.
0:24:15.880000 - 0:24:16.800000::He was getting ready.
0:24:16.800000 - 0:24:18.960000::He's shooting up.
0:24:18.960000 - 0:24:22.080000::So don't you think there's a possibility, right?
0:24:22.120000 - 0:24:27.520000::With AI, that it's we're going to program AI.
0:24:27.520000 - 0:24:28.960000::Who's going to get the technology first?
0:24:28.960000 - 0:24:30::The military, of course.
0:24:30 - 0:24:30.720000::What are they going to do?
0:24:30.720000 - 0:24:32.840000::They're going to use it on a drone so they can teach it
0:24:32.840000 - 0:24:35.520000::to learn exactly where the next costume solomani is
0:24:35.520000 - 0:24:38.560000::so that they can send a drone out to pick and choose
0:24:38.560000 - 0:24:39.600000::who it isn't going to.
0:24:39.600000 - 0:24:43.440000::But now, what if the drone starts to go, OK, I got costume
0:24:43.440000 - 0:24:45.360000::solomani too.
0:24:45.360000 - 0:24:47.800000::Now I'm going to take out my next target.
0:24:47.800000 - 0:24:49.600000::And suddenly, all of our identities
0:24:49.600000 - 0:24:52.680000::are being read by these drones.
0:24:52.680000 - 0:24:56.320000::And it's deciding, is this person a threat
0:24:56.320000 - 0:24:57.600000::to the United States military?
0:24:57.600000 - 0:24:58.680000::Or are they not?
0:24:58.680000 - 0:24:59.640000::Not even a threat.
0:24:59.640000 - 0:25:01.160000::Are they a person?

0:25:00 - 0:25:05.280000::potential threat? Do they know too much? Is their algorithm, the exact algorithm that they're
0:25:05.280000 - 0:25:13.120000::going to use as basically the carrot leaves to see that there's a carrot in there and rip it out?
0:25:14.720000 - 0:25:20.160000::So you're not afraid? I notice you're both quiet. I'm absolutely.
0:25:21.760000 - 0:25:26::I know there, I'm going to be the fucking first person they take out because if I see one of those
0:25:26 - 0:25:29.360000::things around, if I see one in the sky, I'm like flipping them all. Oh no.
0:25:30.800000 - 0:25:36.240000::Oh, have you seen the Bums and Drone's TikTok account? I don't co-sign this. I don't co-sign this
0:25:36.240000 - 0:25:41.760000::because I'm a good person. Better than almost anyone I can think of, but Nate, I could see you on one
0:25:41.760000 - 0:25:45.840000::of those. Get bullied by a drunk. Get bullied by a drunk and all up in your business.
0:25:47.520000 - 0:25:54.640000::Can you imagine doing that to a celebrity? They probably used to it because of the paparazzi.
0:25:55.520000 - 0:25:57.680000::Oh, Shilabuff should be trying to get drunk with it, Oozzi.
0:25:59.760000 - 0:26:04.640000::My God. Shilabuff probably has a lot of guns, huh?
0:26:05.920000 - 0:26:11.040000::I bet he's caring for sure. He's getting into Catholicism, you know?
0:26:11.040000 - 0:26:16.400000::Oh yeah, he's becoming a priest. He's in a movie called Padre Pio, you know, about this.
0:26:16.400000 - 0:26:22.960000::Yeah, yeah. Yeah. There needs to be like an island where these people can go to after they've
0:26:22.960000 - 0:26:28.080000::been Epstein's island. No, not that that will never happen again under my watch.
0:26:30.160000 - 0:26:34.800000::But like an island where celebrities who have been kind of canceled can go to and make their own
0:26:34.800000 - 0:26:39.040000::films just for themselves and they can go through these processes and still be actors
0:26:39.040000 - 0:26:44.560000::and they can have AI audiences lap it up, you know what I mean? And why are we doing that?
0:26:44.560000 - 0:26:49.920000::A simulated fame. Like simulated fame. Is that because they're so dangerous that we're trying to
0:26:49.920000 - 0:26:52.800000::keep them out from rejoining society? There's that charismatic.
0:26:54.160000 - 0:26:57.120000::Right. Imagine having that level of dangerous character, Risma.
0:26:58.480000 - 0:27:05.920000::That's not. No, I can't. Now who had that JFK had dangerous charisma? Lincoln had dangerous
0:27:05.920000 - 0:27:10.800000::charisma. And who else does Simon Cowell? This is why I'm scared right now. Now who else?
0:27:10.800000 - 0:27:19.600000::Now who Biden? Joe Biden has that charisma. He's got a real with the R.I.Z.Z.
0:27:19.680000 - 0:27:25.200000::You know what I'm saying? He's got a musk. He's got a E on. You smell that? It's Joe Biden just
0:27:25.200000 - 0:27:31.680000::had SEX. Oh my God. He walks into a room right away. Everybody drops to their knees and starts
0:27:31.680000 - 0:27:36.560000::bowing and speaking in tongues. Yeah. Why do you think he's so tired all the time? Because he's
0:27:36.560000 - 0:27:40.720000::fucking bust and nuts all fucking like he's just like. Like I.
0:27:43.760000 - 0:27:47.600000::Wow. Why do you think he's got fake teeth and fake hair? Because he's all that shit.
0:27:47.600000 - 0:27:51.280000::He's the off-screen crazy set. When he was bald. Ice cream and bust and nuts.
0:27:52.400000 - 0:27:58.400000::When he was bobbing. He's got real crazy in the 70s. He kind of had crazy swag.
0:27:59.120000 - 0:28:03.760000::Oh. Back then. Not to be a chill. I know. He looked like a little promulpious type of guy.
0:28:04.880000 - 0:28:10.720000::Right. But he loves ice cream. Yeah. He loves. Are you serious? Are you kidding me?
0:28:10.720000 - 0:28:15.680000::Kid me, man. No, I know everything about him. He's sleepy and he likes ice cream. I'm starting
0:28:15.680000 - 0:28:22.160000::to see a pattern. I'm going to war for Biden. In 2024, I'm going to fucking war for Biden.

0:28:29.200000 - 0:28:33.200000::I'm joining the military. I don't care if I'm not. If they're the civil war, I'm fucking
0:28:33.200000 - 0:28:40.640000::signing up immediately. Both sides. Oh, you want to do this again? Yeah. I guess he's going to win.
0:28:40.640000 - 0:28:48.800000::Oh, man. Who Biden? Who's the enemy, Trump? The South. Oh, really?
0:28:48.800000 - 0:28:54.720000::Federates. What about, I don't know. I feel like Virginia is probably going to go for Biden.
0:28:54.720000 - 0:29:00.400000::Are they? And they're like below the Mason Dixon. Are you still going to kill them?
0:29:01.520000 - 0:29:07.680000::I'm going to do whatever it takes, man. I'm going fucking I'm I'm I'll die for Biden.
0:29:07.680000 - 0:29:13.040000::And I want to get over why don't you get in a rowboat? We need Nate. We need you because you know
0:29:13.040000 - 0:29:17.920000::how the Houthis over in Yemen, they're stopping all these trade ships to make them go down towards

0:29:47.440000 - 0:29:52.640000::It's like a citizen's arrest, but for like Amazon kind of like package delivery, like a
0:29:52.640000 - 0:29:56.960000::independent. There needs to be people that just get a package delivery. You should get a tattoo
0:29:56.960000 - 0:30:00::on you as a baby that says unfuckable or like, do you know?

0:30:19.920000 - 0:30:28.080000::Jack Richard types. Yeah. Who's Jack Richard? Did you really just ask me that?
0:30:28.080000 - 0:30:34.080000::Did you like Jack Ryan? But, no, almost the real lead opposite to Jack Ryan.

0:34:26.320000 - 0:34:30.960000::Is he panicking? No. The only time Trump's panicking is when he sees the waiter coming up
0:34:30.960000 - 0:34:35.200000::up up up for the wildlings and he can't figure out how many wings he wants. He's not worried about politics.
0:34:36.080000 - 0:34:40.400000::Right. Or when he can't get his men Donald Berger's as a man.
0:34:40.400000 - 0:34:44.480000::Right. Oh, what his hands are. Small hands. Small hands.

0:37:22.480000 - 0:37:26.440000::cops have the body cams on and then they pretend to have touch
0:37:26.440000 - 0:37:28.920000::fentanyl and like overdose.
0:37:28.920000 - 0:37:30.720000::Hey, it's not possible.
0:37:30.720000 - 0:37:34.160000::You can't touch fentanyl overdose, but imagine that's what
0:37:34.160000 - 0:37:35.160000::happens.
0:37:35.160000 - 0:37:36.160000::So serious.
0:37:36.160000 - 0:37:37.160000::One touches the left.
0:37:37.160000 - 0:37:40.120000::Yeah, you could move you touch it with your tongue.
0:37:40.120000 - 0:37:43.560000::Or are you getting that?
0:37:43.560000 - 0:37:46::Just imagine if we got poison and killed immediately by a
0:37:46 - 0:37:47::wildfire inbox.
0:37:47 - 0:37:48.640000::Oh, everybody anthrax us.
0:37:48.640000 - 0:37:49.640000::We get in.
0:37:50.160000 - 0:37:53.120000::Every single patron is just somebody who's like playing
0:37:53.120000 - 0:37:55.560000::the long con to try to kill us.
0:37:55.560000 - 0:37:58.720000::I would panic so fast if I had anthrax on a letter.
0:37:58.720000 - 0:38:01.800000::Oh, you guys know what I had a teacher.
0:38:01.800000 - 0:38:05.120000::Well, you know I had a teacher that got anthrax locked down
0:38:05.120000 - 0:38:07.880000::during the DC attack of anthrax.
0:38:07.880000 - 0:38:11::They put, oh, this is back when nasal swabs weren't even a
0:38:11 - 0:38:14.440000::thing, but they would put you in the hazmat tent.
0:38:14.440000 - 0:38:15.360000::Hazmat up.
0:38:15.360000 - 0:38:17.240000::They'd come in and they would stick.
0:38:17.240000 - 0:38:18.560000::I remember hearing about it.
0:38:18.560000 - 0:38:20.960000::They'd stick this stick all the way back in your nose and
0:38:20.960000 - 0:38:22::swap it.
0:38:22 - 0:38:23.080000::But guess what?
0:38:23.080000 - 0:38:26.640000::They wouldn't go as far as they would go with COVID swabs.
0:38:26.640000 - 0:38:29.440000::They would go to the back walls of your nose.
0:38:29.440000 - 0:38:31.040000::No, remember those fish COVID swabs?
0:38:31.040000 - 0:38:33.440000::They would go back to the back.
0:38:33.440000 - 0:38:35.120000::I was so late.
0:38:35.120000 - 0:38:37.680000::I do remember that.
0:38:37.680000 - 0:38:40.120000::I was like taunting them like when they were swabs.
0:38:40.120000 - 0:38:41.600000::I don't feel sick.
0:38:41.600000 - 0:38:42.640000::You think that's deep?
0:38:42.640000 - 0:38:43.920000::Yeah, I wouldn't get them up.
0:38:43.920000 - 0:38:44.440000::Yeah, right.
0:38:44.440000 - 0:38:44.920000::Get all of them.
0:38:44.920000 - 0:38:45.920000::I fucking brain.
0:38:45.920000 - 0:38:46.920000::They fish all of them.
0:38:46.920000 - 0:38:50.120000::I would pull out and I would put my face, he could fucking push it on into
0:38:50.120000 - 0:38:51.360000::their hand.
0:38:51.360000 - 0:38:53.360000::No, no, no.
0:38:53.360000 - 0:38:54.360000::You didn't read that.
0:38:54.360000 - 0:38:56.720000::That's not worth COVID lies in me.
0:38:56.720000 - 0:38:57.720000::That was crazy.
0:38:57.720000 - 0:39:01.880000::And in New York City, when you would go to government housing and
0:39:01.880000 - 0:39:06.560000::you would get in a line around the whole building into the courtyard area to
0:39:06.560000 - 0:39:12.960000::get the test outside, everybody is thinking, man, I can't wait to go on a road
0:39:12.960000 - 0:39:13.960000::trip.
0:39:13.960000 - 0:39:15.480000::Hope my friends are cool.
0:39:15.480000 - 0:39:20.200000::I remember getting my first vaccine out in Coney Island, like a high school in Coney
0:39:20.200000 - 0:39:22.200000::Island.
0:39:22.200000 - 0:39:27.080000::And it was like a high school that was built in like the 60s, probably so dated.
0:39:27.080000 - 0:39:32.120000::And they made you the scariest part for me was like, and this was with my anxiety was
0:39:32.120000 - 0:39:33.840000::popping.
0:39:33.840000 - 0:39:35.920000::No sleep apnea treatment.
0:39:35.920000 - 0:39:38.160000::Nothing good going on in my life, all pain.
0:39:38.160000 - 0:39:39.920000::And so yeah, my anxiety was crazy.
0:39:39.920000 - 0:39:40.920000::Right.
0:39:40.920000 - 0:39:43.720000::But they made you go wait in the auditorium for like 15 minutes to make sure you didn't
0:39:43.720000 - 0:39:44.720000::die.
0:39:44.720000 - 0:39:48.040000::And then there were some horrible reactions didn't happen and that really drove me up
0:39:48.040000 - 0:39:49.040000::the wall.
0:39:49.040000 - 0:39:50.040000::That was funny.
0:39:50.040000 - 0:39:51.040000::Yeah.
0:39:51.040000 - 0:39:54.520000::We should do a whole month of just COVID memories.
0:39:54.520000 - 0:39:59.760000::Oh, that's a fun idea because we had a lot of the three of us kind of unofficially
0:39:59.760000 - 0:40:00.040000::started to get out of the way.

0:40:00 - 0:40:01::started joy tactics.
0:40:01 - 0:40:02::That's right.
0:40:02 - 0:40:06.080000::In a sense during COVID because of Fortnite and other things.
0:40:06.080000 - 0:40:09.640000::People I would say do not want to hear one fucking word about COVID ever again though.
0:40:09.640000 - 0:40:10.640000::You know what I'm saying?
0:40:10.640000 - 0:40:13.960000::Well, if it gets brought up in a movie I might turn it off.
0:40:13.960000 - 0:40:17.920000::I don't want to watch this shit.
0:40:17.920000 - 0:40:22.360000::You can feel it ever being an amazing movie, Contagion Style about COVID or no.
0:40:22.360000 - 0:40:23.720000::We just won't even get that.
0:40:23.720000 - 0:40:26.280000::Have you seen a span of flu movie ever?
0:40:26.520000 - 0:40:31.400000::No, and that's funny because my great great grandparents died in that.
0:40:31.400000 - 0:40:32.400000::Both of them.
0:40:32.400000 - 0:40:33.400000::Oh my God.
0:40:33.400000 - 0:40:34.400000::Did they?
0:40:34.400000 - 0:40:35.400000::Yeah.
0:40:35.400000 - 0:40:36.400000::Great, great grandparents.
0:40:36.400000 - 0:40:37.400000::Oh my goodness.
0:40:37.400000 - 0:40:38.400000::Oh my God.
0:40:38.400000 - 0:40:42.200000::Great grand bothers parents both died and he became an orphan.
0:40:42.200000 - 0:40:43.200000::It's 17.
0:40:43.200000 - 0:40:45.040000::It's fucking 19.
0:40:45.040000 - 0:40:50.600000::You got weird ages of your family I think.
0:40:50.600000 - 0:40:54.320000::I just watched a movie called My Best Friends Wedding.
0:40:54.320000 - 0:40:58.640000::Now we're talking with Julia Lawrence.
0:40:58.640000 - 0:40:59.640000::Julia Roberts.
0:40:59.640000 - 0:41:00.640000::Julia Roberts.
0:41:00.640000 - 0:41:02.640000::I'm just going to say Lawrence.
0:41:02.640000 - 0:41:04.840000::Okay, Julia Lawrence.
0:41:04.840000 - 0:41:06.680000::I knew it was something.
0:41:06.680000 - 0:41:11.280000::Yeah, that's because last night I accidentally said Jessica Roberts.
0:41:11.280000 - 0:41:14.240000::Anyways, you've seen that?
0:41:14.240000 - 0:41:15.600000::Yeah, I've seen that.
0:41:15.600000 - 0:41:19.360000::I've seen most Roberts films.
0:41:19.360000 - 0:41:23.440000::So that is a time before they even had twin towers.
0:41:23.440000 - 0:41:26.920000::One of those things built.
0:41:26.920000 - 0:41:28.840000::I don't think that's true.
0:41:28.840000 - 0:41:31.280000::Those things are built in the 70s.
0:41:31.280000 - 0:41:32.280000::Okay.
0:41:32.280000 - 0:41:36.280000::Well, I must have not, yeah, the camera must have been pointed at a different part of the
0:41:36.280000 - 0:41:37.280000::city.
0:41:37.280000 - 0:41:39.960000::No, what are you thinking about, man?
0:41:39.960000 - 0:41:40.960000::You're so quiet.
0:41:40.960000 - 0:41:41.960000::It's still.
0:41:41.960000 - 0:41:43.280000::Well, I was looking up this.
0:41:43.280000 - 0:41:44.280000::I haven't seen this.
0:41:44.280000 - 0:41:46.240000::You guys are bringing up a thing I haven't seen.
0:41:46.240000 - 0:41:48.600000::So like what are my fucking supposed to say, man?
0:41:48.600000 - 0:41:49.600000::I've never seen this.
0:41:49.600000 - 0:41:50.600000::Just ask that man.
0:41:50.600000 - 0:41:51.600000::Just don't be shy.
0:41:51.600000 - 0:41:55.920000::Please don't get so defensive lately because defensiveness does not look good on you.
0:41:55.920000 - 0:41:58.440000::It actually makes you more suspicious.
0:41:58.440000 - 0:41:59.440000::Right.
0:41:59.440000 - 0:42:01.680000::Defensive is a good offense, but actually it's not for your ass.
0:42:01.680000 - 0:42:02.680000::It actually makes you worse.
0:42:02.680000 - 0:42:06.440000::I'm getting more defensive and shy at the same time.
0:42:06.440000 - 0:42:07.440000::That's not a good job.
0:42:07.440000 - 0:42:08.440000::It's so funny.
0:42:08.440000 - 0:42:10.440000::He's being shy.
0:42:10.440000 - 0:42:12.880000::Shy is a dude is.
0:42:12.880000 - 0:42:13.880000::Why is it?
0:42:13.880000 - 0:42:16::I was a shy child.
0:42:16 - 0:42:17.920000::I was a shy adult.
0:42:17.920000 - 0:42:19.240000::I think recently I'm not.
0:42:19.240000 - 0:42:21.680000::What do you guys describe me as shy?
0:42:21.680000 - 0:42:22.680000::Shy Ronnie.
0:42:22.680000 - 0:42:23.680000::No.
0:42:23.680000 - 0:42:24.680000::But have you seen that?
0:42:24.680000 - 0:42:27.360000::I remember when I was younger and I would just stand in circles like with my arm.
0:42:27.360000 - 0:42:29.360000::I remember you being shy.
0:42:29.360000 - 0:42:32.960000::I have a vivid memory of you being shy, man.
0:42:32.960000 - 0:42:35.120000::It was 2018.
0:42:35.120000 - 0:42:36.960000::We were standing in the back of a...
0:42:36.960000 - 0:42:37.960000::A way.
0:42:37.960000 - 0:42:38.960000::A way.
0:42:38.960000 - 0:42:41.960000::Of the Danjo Charles Scholl.
0:42:41.960000 - 0:42:42.960000::Yeah.
0:42:42.960000 - 0:42:43.960000::Yeah.
0:42:43.960000 - 0:42:45.960000::In like the back brewery area.
0:42:45.960000 - 0:42:46.960000::Yeah.
0:42:46.960000 - 0:42:49.800000::Conner and a bunch of people.
0:42:49.800000 - 0:42:53::And I just remember afterwards you being like, fuck, I didn't say anything.
0:42:53 - 0:42:55.200000::I was just standing.
0:42:55.200000 - 0:42:56.200000::That's true.
0:42:56.200000 - 0:42:57.440000::I would just stand there and not say a word.
0:42:57.440000 - 0:42:58.440000::Wouldn't say a single word.
0:42:58.440000 - 0:42:59.440000::Oh, dude.
0:42:59.440000 - 0:43:00.440000::Oh my god.
0:43:00.440000 - 0:43:01.440000::Can I say something or is this to...
0:43:01.440000 - 0:43:02.440000::Yeah.
0:43:02.440000 - 0:43:03.440000::Because this is the public episode.
0:43:03.440000 - 0:43:05.440000::I don't want to say anything crazy, dude.
0:43:05.440000 - 0:43:06.440000::Say it now.
0:43:06.440000 - 0:43:13.280000::Let's just say I didn't meet Nathan Fielder.
0:43:13.280000 - 0:43:17.200000::I did stand in a circle with him and some other people.
0:43:17.200000 - 0:43:18.200000::This is the worst.
0:43:18.200000 - 0:43:22.280000::It's ever been when like nobody was giving me the alley hoop to like...
0:43:22.280000 - 0:43:23.840000::Because I didn't really know anyone.
0:43:23.840000 - 0:43:25.600000::But you always be like, oh, this is Jack.
0:43:25.600000 - 0:43:26.600000::And then...
0:43:26.600000 - 0:43:27.600000::It was tough.
0:43:27.600000 - 0:43:28.600000::It was fun.
0:43:28.600000 - 0:43:30.600000::I remember seeing that.
0:43:30.600000 - 0:43:32.840000::Awful from across the room.
0:43:32.840000 - 0:43:33.840000::If you...
0:43:33.840000 - 0:43:34.840000::It was...
0:43:34.840000 - 0:43:35.840000::Aw.
0:43:35.840000 - 0:43:38.840000::We need some more like social police, you know what I'm saying?
0:43:38.840000 - 0:43:40.840000::We need to be more aware of...
0:43:40.840000 - 0:43:42.640000::If somebody's coming into the fucking...
0:43:42.680000 - 0:43:45.080000::Hey, do you guys know each other?
0:43:45.080000 - 0:43:46.080000::It's just where's the DCC?
0:43:46.080000 - 0:43:48.240000::You can always just check in and just say that.
0:43:48.240000 - 0:43:49.760000::It doesn't hurt to say that.
0:43:49.760000 - 0:43:51::You know what I'm saying?
0:43:51 - 0:43:53.920000::Because it just gives them an end to the...
0:43:53.920000 - 0:43:55.920000::You know...
0:43:55.920000 - 0:43:57.880000::I've seen you guys be that angel before.
0:43:57.880000 - 0:44:04.560000::I'm sure you see my ass out in the front lines helping down soldiers out in social settings.
0:44:04.560000 - 0:44:05.560000::We just need to...
0:44:05.560000 - 0:44:09.440000::To a point though, if you're too weak, there's no hope for you.
0:44:09.440000 - 0:44:10.440000::And you can't be helped.
0:44:10.440000 - 0:44:12.200000::And we're letting you die on the field.
0:44:12.240000 - 0:44:13.240000::You know what I'm saying?
0:44:13.240000 - 0:44:14.240000::Nobody...
0:44:14.240000 - 0:44:15.240000::Yeah, I knew that.
0:44:15.240000 - 0:44:16.240000::No, what you're saying?
0:44:16.240000 - 0:44:18.240000::Because nobody's more forgiving than your creator, by the way.
0:44:18.240000 - 0:44:19.240000::Than the creator?
0:44:19.240000 - 0:44:20.240000::Your creator?
0:44:20.240000 - 0:44:23.240000::No, nobody is more forgiving than your creator.
0:44:23.240000 - 0:44:24.240000::Oh, I see.
0:44:24.240000 - 0:44:26.240000::Who will forgive, but guess what?
0:44:26.240000 - 0:44:28.240000::Eventually, they will take it back.
0:44:28.240000 - 0:44:29.240000::Okay?
0:44:29.240000 - 0:44:36.240000::Because if you disrespect us too many times after us coming in and trying to let you come to us at the cabin for the weekend.
0:44:36.240000 - 0:44:40.240000::If you come up to us and try to introduce yourselves and we can tell that you need some help and you need some guidance,
0:44:40.240000 - 0:44:43.240000::we will fully like basically kidnap you.
0:44:43.240000 - 0:44:45.240000::And we'll continue with us too.
0:44:45.240000 - 0:44:46.240000::Real question.
0:44:46.240000 - 0:44:47.240000::The Merc Shares.
0:44:47.240000 - 0:44:48.240000::Real question.
0:44:48.240000 - 0:44:52.240000::Have you guys ever been disrespected?
0:44:52.240000 - 0:44:55.240000::Have I been disrespected?
0:44:55.240000 - 0:44:58.240000::Yeah.
0:44:58.240000 - 0:45:00.240000::Yeah, that's a funny question.

0:45:00 - 0:45:02.460000::What happened?
0:45:02.460000 - 0:45:04.260000::Yeah.
0:45:04.260000 - 0:45:07.120000::When was the most recent time you were disrespected
0:45:07.120000 - 0:45:09.080000::and how did you remedy that situation?
0:45:12.600000 - 0:45:14.840000::I've just been disrespected so many times.
0:45:14.840000 - 0:45:16::I've had enough.
0:45:16 - 0:45:18.320000::Quite frankly, there's so many times
0:45:18.320000 - 0:45:20.120000::that I'm just pinned up.
0:45:20.120000 - 0:45:23.440000::I'm turning into a villain, the amount of disrespect
0:45:23.440000 - 0:45:24.640000::that I'm getting.
0:45:24.640000 - 0:45:25.480000::Yeah.
0:45:25.480000 - 0:45:26.520000::It's getting dark.
0:45:26.520000 - 0:45:31.440000::It's getting, you know, like, I'm starting to transform
0:45:31.440000 - 0:45:33.160000::into something else that I don't want.
0:45:33.160000 - 0:45:36.800000::You sound tired and I mean tired in a lifelong type of way.
0:45:36.800000 - 0:45:37.960000::Yeah, yeah.
0:45:37.960000 - 0:45:38.960000::I feel it too.
0:45:38.960000 - 0:45:40.240000::Imagine being me, you know?
0:45:40.240000 - 0:45:40.960000::I can't.
0:45:40.960000 - 0:45:43.920000::Well, Nate, but there's a certain point, right?
0:45:43.920000 - 0:45:48.920000::When you stop fighting the tide, and you find peace
0:45:48.920000 - 0:45:50::in where you are.
0:45:50 - 0:45:52.840000::You know what they say is the most peaceful death?
0:45:52.840000 - 0:45:55.240000::It's a drowning death because you're struggling
0:45:55.240000 - 0:45:57.520000::against the current, struggling to keep your head
0:45:57.520000 - 0:45:58.120000::above water.
0:45:58.120000 - 0:46:02.920000::And when you finally realize there's no hope,
0:46:02.920000 - 0:46:04.720000::it's pure warmth.
0:46:04.720000 - 0:46:07.360000::And you sink into one of the biggest bodies of water
0:46:07.360000 - 0:46:10.280000::on the planet, the ocean or wherever you are.
0:46:10.280000 - 0:46:12.160000::And you feel peace.
0:46:12.160000 - 0:46:15.640000::And I think you need to give up right now and just feel
0:46:15.640000 - 0:46:18.320000::that peace and see if you don't get picked up by a whale
0:46:18.320000 - 0:46:19::at some point.
0:46:19 - 0:46:20.880000::You know what I'm saying?
0:46:20.880000 - 0:46:22.880000::Well, that's what happened to that dude that jumped off the golden
0:46:22.880000 - 0:46:25.200000::gate, but a whale saved his ass.
0:46:25.200000 - 0:46:29.080000::A seal came and bumped him on the seal over again to the Coast
0:46:29.080000 - 0:46:29.600000::Guards.
0:46:29.600000 - 0:46:30.440000::No way.
0:46:30.440000 - 0:46:31.720000::Are you mad at seals?
0:46:31.720000 - 0:46:34.840000::That Alphamarthus vineyard poking their heads up looking,
0:46:34.840000 - 0:46:36.600000::trying to take a bite of our tail.
0:46:36.600000 - 0:46:38.920000::Where are they trying to tell us?
0:46:38.920000 - 0:46:40.040000::What were they trying to tell us?
0:46:40.040000 - 0:46:43.520000::They're trying to tell us they want to have both.
0:46:43.520000 - 0:46:47.320000::They want one of them old-timey balls that they had in the 1920s.
0:46:47.320000 - 0:46:48.560000::You know, below what you talking about?
0:46:48.560000 - 0:46:50.800000::You know how seals love the balls?
0:46:50.800000 - 0:46:51.800000::Like Glover.
0:46:51.800000 - 0:46:52.640000::Yeah.
0:46:52.640000 - 0:46:55::You think I could go one on one slap box
0:46:55 - 0:46:56::and a seal.
0:46:56 - 0:46:58::No, the pen's on the seal.
0:46:58 - 0:46:59::No.
0:46:59 - 0:47:01::A baby seal?
0:47:01 - 0:47:02::Maybe.
0:47:02 - 0:47:03::If you're lucky.
0:47:03 - 0:47:04::Probably not.
0:47:04 - 0:47:05::I would never have never seen a king seal.
0:47:05 - 0:47:06::A king seal.
0:47:06 - 0:47:08::I'm talking about a war just made for slapping.
0:47:08 - 0:47:09::You know what I'm saying?
0:47:09 - 0:47:11::That's a whole slap box.
0:47:11 - 0:47:14::A appendage is all just one slap.
0:47:14 - 0:47:16::It's the Antarctica's the fucking slappatorium man.
0:47:16 - 0:47:17::Don't go to the penguin.

0:47:39 - 0:47:41.440000::Who's got the best slap in the animal kingdom?
0:47:41.440000 - 0:47:43::It's probably a damn, oh no.
0:47:43 - 0:47:48::Probably a whale once they get, because you know how big those can get right.
0:47:48 - 0:47:50.400000::This killer whale.
0:47:50.400000 - 0:47:52.960000::You know it would be the most, imagine a whale version.
0:47:52.960000 - 0:47:53.960000::There's a giraffe.
0:47:53.960000 - 0:47:55.960000::Well, giraffe's got the worst slap.
0:47:55.960000 - 0:47:57.960000::The giraffe's going down quick.
0:47:57.960000 - 0:48:00.960000::The giraffe is getting knocked out by a fucking bird.
0:48:00.960000 - 0:48:01.960000::Giraffe versus a falcon?
0:48:01.960000 - 0:48:02.960000::Oh shit.
0:48:02.960000 - 0:48:03.960000::They're down.

0:48:12.960000 - 0:48:13.960000::So be it.
0:48:13.960000 - 0:48:16.960000::Somebody made a comment.
0:48:16.960000 - 0:48:19.960000::There was, I don't know if it was on a YouTube video or something, but somebody commented
0:48:19.960000 - 0:48:24.960000::on us in a way that made us feel like we are our listeners little experiment.
0:48:24.960000 - 0:48:25.960000::And I guess I'm rocking with it.
0:48:25.960000 - 0:48:26.960000::What is this?
0:48:26.960000 - 0:48:39.960000::It was like, it was something about like, it's interesting to note that somebody entering the lobby of a hotel is enough to make all three of them spin out and not be able to focus anymore in a way that.
0:48:39.960000 - 0:48:41.960000::Yeah, I read that too.
0:48:41.960000 - 0:48:47.960000::And I was like, I don't understand like that's like a dish or like what they're observing us.
0:48:47.960000 - 0:48:49.960000::I was just a pure observation.
0:48:49.960000 - 0:48:52.960000::I was like really, you know what I want to tell that person.
0:48:52.960000 - 0:48:54.960000::Take a good long look.
0:48:54.960000 - 0:48:56.960000::Observe as much as you want.
0:48:56.960000 - 0:48:58.960000::You're not going to be able to predict our next move.
0:48:58.960000 - 0:49:00.960000::That's what I'm sure.
0:49:00.960000 - 0:49:01.960000::Oh, I don't know.
0:49:01.960000 - 0:49:03.960000::They can't talk fully right.
0:49:03.960000 - 0:49:05.960000::Or wow, they stumble over their words.
0:49:05.960000 - 0:49:07.960000::It's not on purpose, by the way.
0:49:07.960000 - 0:49:10.960000::Get a, get a one of them sick all the time.
0:49:10.960000 - 0:49:11.960000::Yeah.

0:49:13.960000 - 0:49:14.960000::I bet you can't.
0:49:14.960000 - 0:49:16.960000::Where was that comment not that I care?
0:49:16.960000 - 0:49:21.960000::Bad reason my hand.

0:49:39.960000 - 0:49:40.960000::That's what's wrong.
0:49:40.960000 - 0:49:41.960000::I don't know.
0:49:42.960000 - 0:49:43.960000::Okay.

0:53:03.360000 - 0:53:05.600000::It's something that I normally hate,
0:53:05.600000 - 0:53:07.560000::and I wouldn't even give a chance.
0:53:07.560000 - 0:53:08.920000::And it's called Domino's Pizza.
0:53:08.920000 - 0:53:10.640000::Mm.

0:53:22 - 0:53:24.840000::Being sand with somebody spilled a little bit of
0:53:24.840000 - 0:53:27.120000::fucking Terry free cheese.
0:53:27.120000 - 0:53:30.160000::I haven't had Domino's in a minute.
0:53:30.160000 - 0:53:31.840000::There's a reason for that.

0:53:36.920000 - 0:53:40.320000::Like this, you know, maybe pay like two bucks more
0:53:40.320000 - 0:53:43.760000::for like just a local spot that has like 20 million times
0:53:43.760000 - 0:53:45.760000::better pizza.
0:53:45.760000 - 0:53:48.520000::Because what's wrong with these people?
0:53:48.520000 - 0:53:49.880000::Honestly, sometimes it's like.
0:53:49.880000 - 0:53:51.320000::That's like kids birthday party.
0:53:51.320000 - 0:53:54.760000::Like a parent that doesn't give a fuck about their kid.
0:53:54.760000 - 0:53:56.840000::And they're like, just need to order a bunch of stuff for a
0:53:56.840000 - 0:53:57.840000::fucking sleepover.
0:53:57.840000 - 0:54:00.600000::That's what that's what that's where Domino's comes into play.

0:54:01.440000 - 0:54:02.760000::I don't even think then, man.
0:54:02.760000 - 0:54:05.960000::I think it comes into play when you're fucking the
0:54:05.960000 - 0:54:09.800000::apocalypse has happened and you roll up on a frozen pile of trash.
0:54:09.800000 - 0:54:11::And that's what you got.
