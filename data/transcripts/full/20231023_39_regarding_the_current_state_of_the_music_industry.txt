0:02:40.240000 - 0:02:44.600000::But I threw out all the words I know about the music industry.
0:02:44.600000 - 0:02:46::The music industry, man.
0:02:46 - 0:02:46.800000::Your time has come.

0:03:01.840000 - 0:03:03.600000::Almost all of y'all listening right now.
0:03:03.600000 - 0:03:07.560000::We know you guys are fucking frustrated with the contracts that you've been stuck in right
0:03:07.560000 - 0:03:08.560000::now.
0:03:08.560000 - 0:03:10.640000::You think, oh man, I'm going to go rock with this record label.
0:03:10.640000 - 0:03:11.760000::I'm going to rock with this record label.
0:03:11.760000 - 0:03:13.160000::And you get to get stuck.
0:03:13.160000 - 0:03:17.040000::And all of a sudden, we're missing out on the Jimmy Hendrix's on the events of a
0:03:17.040000 - 0:03:21.720000::full on these Selena Gomez's of our generation.
0:03:21.720000 - 0:03:22.720000::So hold on tight.
0:03:22.720000 - 0:03:24.120000::We'll get you out of those contracts.
0:03:24.120000 - 0:03:26.640000::Well, let's dig into contracts.
0:03:26.640000 - 0:03:33.120000::I think that is just something that I've been really wanted to talk about on this podcast
0:03:33.120000 - 0:03:36.360000::is musicians contract.
0:03:36.360000 - 0:03:38.680000::And that's about time.
0:03:38.680000 - 0:03:43.360000::And this is where a lot of young artists are getting burned these days.
0:03:43.360000 - 0:03:44.360000::That's for sure.
0:03:44.760000 - 0:03:50.400000::They see the seven figures on the contract.
0:03:50.400000 - 0:03:52.680000::I think I'll never go hungry again.
0:03:52.680000 - 0:03:55.960000::I'm by my mom a fucking compressor.
0:03:55.960000 - 0:03:57.840000::Mercedes compressor.
0:03:57.840000 - 0:04:01.640000::Well, what they don't realize is that's signing your life away.
0:04:01.640000 - 0:04:04.040000::That's making you deal with the devil.
0:04:04.040000 - 0:04:05.040000::Mm-hmm.
0:04:05.040000 - 0:04:06.400000::Well, it's short-sighted, right?
0:04:06.400000 - 0:04:09.480000::Because it comes from not believing in yourself.
0:04:09.480000 - 0:04:12.120000::You think I'm going to take a cookie now because I don't believe that I can make myself
0:04:12.120000 - 0:04:14.560000::to apple pie tonight.
0:04:14.560000 - 0:04:15.560000::Right.
0:04:15.560000 - 0:04:16.560000::You can.
0:04:16.560000 - 0:04:17.560000::Yeah.
0:04:17.560000 - 0:04:19.560000::Right.
0:04:19.560000 - 0:04:22.920000::So what's the trade off?
0:04:22.920000 - 0:04:24.760000::What does the trade off with this?
0:04:24.760000 - 0:04:25.760000::You know what I'm saying?
0:04:25.760000 - 0:04:29.960000::So you could, OK, take the contract, all right?
0:04:29.960000 - 0:04:32.360000::And I've been offered some of these contracts.
0:04:32.360000 - 0:04:34.840000::You know, I know me too.
0:04:34.840000 - 0:04:35.840000::And I've written on it.
0:04:35.840000 - 0:04:36.840000::I'm saying no.
0:04:36.840000 - 0:04:37.840000::I've written on it.
0:04:37.840000 - 0:04:40.280000::Go ahead.
0:04:40.280000 - 0:04:42.840000::John, or were you offered the contract for a night?
0:04:42.840000 - 0:04:45.480000::Well, it was a new sort of genre that I had.
0:04:45.480000 - 0:04:52.520000::I've been, you know how there's points in music history when you have rock, you have hip
0:04:52.520000 - 0:04:54.520000::hop, you have R&B.
0:04:54.520000 - 0:04:55.520000::Right.
0:04:55.520000 - 0:04:57.920000::And there's only so many genres.
0:04:57.920000 - 0:05:00::And at some point, the genre is a bit more than that.

0:05:00 - 0:05:17::I was one of the trailblazers in Yodeling and I mixed that with sort of hip hop and R&B
0:05:17 - 0:05:21::and just created a whole new sort of sector that was just my own.
0:05:21 - 0:05:28::And you made the level saw me and they, you know, my grandma had Alzheimer's.
0:05:28 - 0:05:30::And did she know that?
0:05:30 - 0:05:34::Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
0:05:34 - 0:05:37::Weirdly enough, that's not the time to joke about that.
0:05:37 - 0:05:38::I know, I know.
0:05:38 - 0:05:39::I get up.
0:05:39 - 0:05:40::You want to piss me off?
0:05:40 - 0:05:41::Yeah, keep talking about my grandma.
0:05:41 - 0:05:43::I literally, I just started trying.
0:05:43 - 0:05:44::I just started trying.
0:05:44 - 0:05:45::All right.
0:05:45 - 0:05:46::No, she was so sweet.
0:05:46 - 0:05:53::Her name was Betty and she grew up in Wisconsin, Midwest, much the Bayes.
0:05:53 - 0:05:56::And she used to be a Yodler for fun.
0:05:56 - 0:05:59::She'd go with her sister in Yodel at places with her daughter.
0:05:59 - 0:06:00::Yodel, Yodel, Yodel.
0:06:00 - 0:06:03::And she couldn't really remember much, but at the end of her life,
0:06:03 - 0:06:05::she could Yodel like crazy.
0:06:05 - 0:06:07::So she's there kind of out of it.
0:06:07 - 0:06:10::And then, well, you want to try some Yodel ain't Betty?
0:06:10 - 0:06:11::Yodel, Yodel, Yodel.
0:06:11 - 0:06:12::Going crazy.
0:06:12 - 0:06:16::So that's the power of the mind and the power of music.
0:06:16 - 0:06:19::And that's why we're not taking this conversation lightly because music is not,
0:06:19 - 0:06:24::is not numbers in siding on a dotted line with Warner Brothers, whatever.
0:06:24 - 0:06:25::No.
0:06:25 - 0:06:26::Music is music.
0:06:26 - 0:06:27::No, it's a universal language.
0:06:27 - 0:06:28::It's a language.
0:06:28 - 0:06:29::A universal language.
0:06:29 - 0:06:30::A universal language.
0:06:30 - 0:06:34::Well, you guys remember the one universal, this is the one universal music genre that I made last year last Christmas time.
0:06:34 - 0:06:35::Right.
0:06:35 - 0:06:41::So your universal music with a hundred year long song written by, I can remember his name was Apple.
0:06:41 - 0:06:43::Something, something about Apple.
0:06:43 - 0:06:48::But that was a song that was a hundred years long that you, the idea was you start playing it when you're one.
0:06:48 - 0:06:49::Oh, my God.
0:06:49 - 0:06:50::Welcome to the world.
0:06:50 - 0:06:51::Wow.
0:06:51 - 0:06:52::Wow.
0:06:52 - 0:06:53::Wow.
0:06:53 - 0:06:54::Wow.
0:06:54 - 0:06:58::The born of a hundred years, a hundred year long song.
0:06:58 - 0:07:00::And it would keep going for every fucking year.
0:07:00 - 0:07:02::You get all the way up to 97.
0:07:02 - 0:07:03::Oh.
0:07:03 - 0:07:04::Yeah.
0:07:04 - 0:07:16::So you, but, but to do that, to have that, you would need some Dalai Lama style musician figures to where you know how the Dalai Lama is chosen as a child in his whole life or
0:07:16 - 0:07:19::or her whole, I think it's just has to be guys.
0:07:19 - 0:07:20::I'm sorry about that.
0:07:20 - 0:07:21::I didn't mean it.
0:07:21 - 0:07:22::It's guys only for the Dalai Lama.
0:07:22 - 0:07:25::It's guys only and I'm trying to change it with a lot of what's trying to make a Dalai letters.
0:07:25 - 0:07:26::That's for sure.
0:07:26 - 0:07:32::The Dalai Lama is coming in quicker than you realize.
0:07:32 - 0:07:34::And the revolution starts today.
0:07:34 - 0:07:40::But imagine, because they used to have this in Aztec all type of cultures where children are picked up and
0:07:40 - 0:07:54::they made the chosen ones, either they're sacrificed or they're made into some special type of priest, getting some child who looks like it's going to have right out of the womb, an amazing voice, putting it in the center of the earth at a temple that will be designed all metal right by the core.
0:07:54 - 0:07:59::So they stay warm and just singing for 100 years.
0:07:59 - 0:08:01::Their hair grows along their nails grow along.
0:08:01 - 0:08:03::They can't really see because they're raising the dark.
0:08:03 - 0:08:05::But they're singing straight up.
0:08:05 - 0:08:12::And when it finally when they turn 100 years old, their hair reaches the top of the earth and we can yank them out and pick pluck them like onions.
0:08:12 - 0:08:15::And they're perfectly healthy even at that point.
0:08:15 - 0:08:19::Why do we weirdly bring so much magical realism to this podcast?
0:08:19 - 0:08:21::I don't know.
0:08:21 - 0:08:22::I don't know.
0:08:22 - 0:08:23::I don't know.
0:08:23 - 0:08:24::I don't know.
0:08:24 - 0:08:25::I don't know.
0:08:25 - 0:08:32::We like with Alice in Wonderland mixed with Lars von Trier mixed with like whatever guy.
0:08:32 - 0:08:33::Right.
0:08:33 - 0:08:34::And he's one of the words no budget.
0:08:34 - 0:08:35::No budget.
0:08:35 - 0:08:37::We're going to be the first budget.
0:08:37 - 0:08:38::We're going to be the first budget.
0:08:38 - 0:08:42::Now that's nominated for an Oscar for Sound Design.
0:08:42 - 0:08:44::Well, this is what I want to say.
0:08:44 - 0:08:45::You mentioned budget.
0:08:45 - 0:08:46::Okay.
0:08:46 - 0:08:47::Yeah.
0:08:47 - 0:08:48::What do you guys think about this?
0:08:48 - 0:08:53::I think that we should start a joy tactics.
0:08:53 - 0:08:56::Budget record label.
0:08:56 - 0:08:58::And sign some artists.
0:08:58 - 0:08:59::Now.
0:08:59 - 0:09:03.480000::and we're yeah, we could have auditions.
0:09:03.480000 - 0:09:07.040000::That we said, not gonna lie productions.
0:09:07.040000 - 0:09:08.040000::Oh, I thought you said that.
0:09:08.040000 - 0:09:09.760000::I thought it was a production company.
0:09:09.760000 - 0:09:13.280000::NGL productions, not gonna lie records.

0:18:58.120000 - 0:19:05.080000::I know two facts about every single field on the fucking planet versus pyramid knowledge,
0:19:05.080000 - 0:19:07.760000::where you know a lot about one thing.
0:19:07.760000 - 0:19:12.960000::But if that thing becomes illegal, you're out.
0:19:12.960000 - 0:19:13.960000::Yep.
0:19:13.960000 - 0:19:16.040000::Put it on your eggs and bubble's going fucking crazy.
0:19:16.040000 - 0:19:17.840000::I need two paws for one second.
0:19:17.840000 - 0:19:18.840000::I don't know what's going on.
0:19:18.840000 - 0:19:19.840000::I got it.
0:19:19.840000 - 0:19:20.840000::What's happening?
0:19:20.840000 - 0:19:21.840000::What's happening?
0:19:21.840000 - 0:19:22.840000::What's happening?
0:19:23.120000 - 0:19:25.280000::Just I'm pausing because bubbles are going crazy.
0:19:25.280000 - 0:19:26.560000::I don't know what's going on.
0:19:26.560000 - 0:19:29.680000::What can I talk about this while you're leaving?
0:19:29.680000 - 0:19:32.080000::Okay, so this is a tangent.
0:19:32.080000 - 0:19:36.480000::But I got a, this is probably just going to spoil my joy for the week.
0:19:36.480000 - 0:19:41.480000::But I got these new earbuds, ear buds, sorry.
0:19:41.480000 - 0:19:42.480000::Movie.
0:19:42.480000 - 0:19:50.480000::And they're the Bose Quiet Comfort 2 Earbuds.
0:19:50.480000 - 0:19:51.280000::Really?
0:19:51.280000 - 0:19:52.600000::Okay.
0:19:52.600000 - 0:19:53.600000::Are you wearing them?
0:19:53.600000 - 0:19:56.480000::And just to catch you up, no, I'm not wearing them right now.
0:19:56.480000 - 0:19:58.480000::I got a new Bluetooth Earbuds Eric.
0:19:58.480000 - 0:19:59.840000::The Bose Quiet Comfort.

0:20:00 - 0:20:05.620000::To your buds. I love you. I love them. Boba's a shout would die right all over the floor
0:20:06.720000 - 0:20:11.600000::Jesus, so you're so sorry. I need to wipe it up and then I can continue
0:20:12.480000 - 0:20:19.020000::I'm so sorry. It's all your thing just it'll take two things just do it just fucking do it. You piece of shit
0:20:20.280000 - 0:20:22.040000::God
0:20:22.040000 - 0:20:27.320000::So anyways, there there's been a technology. I've never been more I
0:20:28.320000 - 0:20:30.320000::I feel like a
0:20:31.760000 - 0:20:38::Like how someone would feel if somebody time traveled from the future and
0:20:38.720000 - 0:20:44.440000::We're to present to me a piece of technology that I would have no clue
0:20:45.080000 - 0:20:53.520000::Not even not even a single ounce of my brain can wrap around how this technology works and what happens is you put these
0:20:53.520000 - 0:21:02.400000::Earbuds in your ears and you can hear you know everything the outside world and then it a switch happens where it emutes
0:21:03.440000 - 0:21:11.480000::Outside sounds and it like goes into this noise cancelling mode and there is I do not understand it is complete magic
0:21:11.480000 - 0:21:14.600000::I have no fucking clue how what is it doing to
0:21:15.360000 - 0:21:21.920000::Noise cancel you know do you know do you have you have any earbuds or headphones that do let me ask crazy
0:21:22.280000 - 0:21:24.280000::These are buds or are they phones
0:21:26.920000 - 0:21:28.920000::Their earbuds noise cancelsing
0:21:29.920000 - 0:21:33.240000::But they but they noise cancel what's that
0:21:36.560000 - 0:21:39.920000::Why say again I think you broke up
0:21:42.840000 - 0:21:48.680000::Okay, sorry they are earbuds so this astonishing thing is like okay noise cancelling
0:21:48.680000 - 0:21:54.640000::I feel like maybe I'm just so far behind on that technology, but I feel like noise cancelling technology is
0:21:55.760000 - 0:21:59.400000::Just if you put it on it just cancelling out the
0:22:00.240000 - 0:22:04.280000::You know just the inherent I don't know how to say that I'm just astounded by this technology
0:22:04.280000 - 0:22:06.680000::Have you ever had has this ever happened to you?
0:22:07.520000 - 0:22:12.520000::I'm wearing it right now. I'm wearing it right now Nate
0:22:14.160000 - 0:22:16.880000::Can you hear me but do they I?
0:22:17.880000 - 0:22:23.440000::Don't I don't know how to express this but wait what can you hear me right now?
0:22:24.880000 - 0:22:26.880000::Yes, okay
0:22:29.120000 - 0:22:31.120000::Yes, they cancel noise
0:22:32.280000 - 0:22:38.240000::Conversation how does that work? I don't know man. I mean let me try and answer here
0:22:38.240000 - 0:22:43.720000::Let's make our best guesses and then let's Google it. So my guess. This is my guess. Oh, okay, go ahead
0:22:44.440000 - 0:22:46.440000::My guess is that it is
0:22:46.920000 - 0:22:55.920000::sending a sound into your ear so it's like muting out the sound with like a white noise sort of sound that you can't even hear
0:22:56.440000 - 0:22:58.440000::Yeah, okay, what's your guess?
0:23:00.280000 - 0:23:06.600000::My guess is it is sucking air out of your ear physically and putting it back into the world
0:23:09.040000 - 0:23:11.040000::Using nanotechnology
0:23:11.280000 - 0:23:18.240000::Okay, well that's definitely wrong. All right. I mean, it's gotta be it's gotta be like because I don't think anything
0:23:18.240000 - 0:23:24.520000::Physics does something does something physically open and close in there. I don't think so I think that's what I'm saying like no
0:23:24.520000 - 0:23:31.440000::I just like you I think it emits a a blocking style frequency that basically acts as a
0:23:31.800000 - 0:23:36.880000::As a Van Allen radiation belt for those who are with me on that that don't believe that oh shit
0:23:36.880000 - 0:23:43.520000::I'm not that's too advanced for me, but those who don't know that human beings can't pass through the Van Allen radiation belt to get to the moon
0:23:43.520000 - 0:23:50.720000::And that's why we never been there. Oh, right, right, right what I'm saying. It's a fair. It's a audio a wall of auditory molecular
0:23:51.280000 - 0:23:53.120000::Faraday cage
0:23:53.120000 - 0:23:57.560000::Let's Google it. Okay, okay, Eric. Do you know how noise cancellation works?
0:23:58.360000 - 0:24:04.080000::Essentially I do yeah very rudimentary. I can explain it in numbers, but probably not through my words
0:24:04.080000 - 0:24:11.360000::All right, okay, just give us a hint. We're seven eight. Yeah, really nine nine thousand times
0:24:13.680000 - 0:24:18.080000::I have the answer it's crazy divided by what are you ready to fucking even know?
0:24:19.680000 - 0:24:26.960000::Noise canceling devices have a built-in microphone which produces the opposite reversed sound waves to neutralize
0:24:27.360000 - 0:24:32.520000::Surrounding noise of course, no, so that means if I was to go open your ear and go like this
0:24:32.520000 - 0:24:35::You're noise canceling headphones are gonna like this
0:24:37.720000 - 0:24:44.600000::Why can't they do this with camouflage basically digital camel camel camouflage you got a camera in the back of camera in the front
0:24:45.800000 - 0:24:50.760000::Okay, or display in the front the camera in the back reverses the image to show on led
0:24:51.160000 - 0:24:56.120000::What's in the back in the front so it looks like it's a bright fucking there get us in skunk works
0:24:56.840000 - 0:24:58.840000::Get us in Raytheon please

0:25:00 - 0:25:03::We could develop the craziest military technology.
0:25:03 - 0:25:05.800000::And Queen designed some toilet paper that doesn't break
0:25:05.800000 - 0:25:07.400000::while you cleaning up your dog's diarrhea
0:25:07.400000 - 0:25:10.400000::because I just got diarrhea all on my hands
0:25:10.400000 - 0:25:13.200000::in a way that's fucking sucked.
0:25:13.200000 - 0:25:15.500000::What about washable toilet paper?
0:25:15.500000 - 0:25:16.500000::Is that thing?
0:25:16.500000 - 0:25:18::That's gotta be a thing.
0:25:18 - 0:25:19::Those are called rats.
0:25:19 - 0:25:20.500000::Washable toilet paper.
0:25:20.500000 - 0:25:21.500000::What if you did this?
0:25:21.500000 - 0:25:22.800000::This would be so economical.
0:25:22.800000 - 0:25:28.800000::You wipe your ass with a rewashable toilet paper.
0:25:28.800000 - 0:25:32.300000::And then you flush the dukey down.
0:25:32.300000 - 0:25:34.300000::And then after you're done wiping with that,
0:25:34.300000 - 0:25:38.300000::you take the toilet paper and you wash it in the toilet.
0:25:38.300000 - 0:25:41.300000::And it's all in one location.
0:25:41.300000 - 0:25:44.300000::And then you put it back up.
0:25:44.300000 - 0:25:46.300000::That's called conservation.
0:25:46.300000 - 0:25:49.300000::And saving the environment, it's not pretty.
0:25:49.300000 - 0:25:50.300000::You know what I'm saying?
0:25:50.300000 - 0:25:51.300000::No, it's ugly.
0:25:51.300000 - 0:25:52.300000::It's not gonna be pretty.
0:25:52.300000 - 0:25:53.300000::It's gonna be ugly.
0:25:53.300000 - 0:25:55.300000::It's gonna be gross.
0:25:55.300000 - 0:25:57.300000::I get it, man.
0:25:57.300000 - 0:25:58.800000::Sometimes the grossest thing you'll ever do
0:25:58.800000 - 0:26:01.800000::is the cleanest thing you could have done.
0:26:01.800000 - 0:26:03.300000::Wow.
0:26:03.300000 - 0:26:05.300000::I just came up with that phrase.
0:26:05.300000 - 0:26:06.300000::Respect.
0:26:06.300000 - 0:26:07.800000::So now where's it headed?
0:26:07.800000 - 0:26:08.800000::Where's music, kid?
0:26:08.800000 - 0:26:10.800000::Because I have some thoughts.
0:26:10.800000 - 0:26:14.300000::Lil Nas X brought Raptor Country, changed the game.
0:26:14.300000 - 0:26:15.800000::I was trying to do it.
0:26:15.800000 - 0:26:19.300000::I'm not saying he stole my shit, but I'm saying there are some crazy
0:26:19.300000 - 0:26:20.300000::Miller.
0:26:20.300000 - 0:26:21.800000::You are working style.
0:26:21.800000 - 0:26:22.800000::Okay.
0:26:22.800000 - 0:26:24.800000::But I appreciate him and I've been trying to get in contact
0:26:24.800000 - 0:26:25.800000::with him.
0:26:25.800000 - 0:26:26.800000::Just get a cup of coffee with him.
0:26:26.800000 - 0:26:27.800000::Oh, bye.
0:26:27.800000 - 0:26:29.800000::A cup of coffee with Starbucks.
0:26:29.800000 - 0:26:34.800000::You know, I just thought of the fucking biggest life hack
0:26:34.800000 - 0:26:36.800000::for picking somebody's brain.
0:26:36.800000 - 0:26:37.800000::Hey, what's up?
0:26:37.800000 - 0:26:38.800000::You want to go get lunch with me?
0:26:38.800000 - 0:26:40.800000::I just want to pick your brain or not lunch.
0:26:40.800000 - 0:26:41.800000::Just a cup of coffee.
0:26:41.800000 - 0:26:42.800000::It's easy as all hell.
0:26:42.800000 - 0:26:43.800000::Let's get one cup.
0:26:43.800000 - 0:26:45.800000::And then we can go when we're done drinking it.
0:26:45.800000 - 0:26:48.800000::Meanwhile, if you guys, have you guys really ever been like,
0:26:48.800000 - 0:26:50.800000::can I go, can I pick your brain?
0:26:50.800000 - 0:26:52.800000::Take it as lunch, pick your brain.
0:26:53.800000 - 0:26:55.800000::I'm about to say the fucking punchline of the story.
0:26:55.800000 - 0:26:58.800000::Oh, I thought the coffee was the punchline.
0:26:58.800000 - 0:26:59.800000::No, dude.
0:26:59.800000 - 0:27:00.800000::It's about to come.
0:27:00.800000 - 0:27:01.800000::This is a life hack.
0:27:01.800000 - 0:27:02.800000::Oh, please.
0:27:02.800000 - 0:27:05.800000::You need to listen because you pick people's brains all the time.
0:27:05.800000 - 0:27:07.800000::You say one cup and then we're done.
0:27:07.800000 - 0:27:11.800000::Then you whip out the biggest fucking cup in the fucking world.
0:27:11.800000 - 0:27:14.800000::Oh, yeah.
0:27:14.800000 - 0:27:16.800000::And then you suck for two weeks.
0:27:16.800000 - 0:27:18.800000::Let me ask and ask away.
0:27:18.800000 - 0:27:19.800000::Excuse me, Quentin Tarantino.
0:27:19.800000 - 0:27:21.800000::How do you get so smooth with it socially?
0:27:22.800000 - 0:27:27.800000::You bring in the catheter and like the fucking a drum to pee into behind you.
0:27:27.800000 - 0:27:28.800000::It's like we're all behind you.
0:27:28.800000 - 0:27:30.800000::Bring in the bubble of the dry herb vaporizer.
0:27:30.800000 - 0:27:31.800000::That's a gene.
0:27:31.800000 - 0:27:36.800000::You also put a dry herb vaporizer marijuana straw in a soda cup.
0:27:36.800000 - 0:27:37.800000::Genius.
0:27:37.800000 - 0:27:40.800000::And smoke out the straw.
0:27:40.800000 - 0:27:44.800000::Oh, I saw some boys at the airport.
0:27:44.800000 - 0:27:49.800000::They all had Arizona iced tea in their little side pockets on their backpacks.
0:27:49.800000 - 0:27:53.800000::And I can see the part where you twist it off and weed goes inside.
0:27:53.800000 - 0:27:56.800000::So I took them by the neck and said if I can get it together,
0:27:56.800000 - 0:27:58.800000::it'll be a little more secret with it.
0:27:58.800000 - 0:27:59.800000::And stop smoking that shit.
0:27:59.800000 - 0:28:00.800000::It'll make you psychotic.
0:28:00.800000 - 0:28:04.800000::Next time your juggler is coming out like a...
0:28:04.800000 - 0:28:08.800000::What do you guys think about?
0:28:08.800000 - 0:28:12.800000::So artists are very troubled.
0:28:12.800000 - 0:28:14.800000::There's a lot of darkness.
0:28:14.800000 - 0:28:15.800000::I know.
0:28:15.800000 - 0:28:18.800000::In a lot of artists, there's a lot of death.
0:28:18.800000 - 0:28:20.800000::There is a lot of drug use.
0:28:20.800000 - 0:28:22.800000::There's a lot of alcohol abuse.
0:28:22.800000 - 0:28:24.800000::Substance abuse.
0:28:24.800000 - 0:28:27.800000::But there's also a lot of creativity.
0:28:27.800000 - 0:28:29.800000::And some artists need weed.
0:28:29.800000 - 0:28:31.800000::They need to get black out high to get into the studio.
0:28:31.800000 - 0:28:34.800000::They need to get all fucked up before they get into the studio.
0:28:34.800000 - 0:28:36.800000::I'm agreeing.
0:28:36.800000 - 0:28:39.800000::That's how I need to be when I get in there.
0:28:39.800000 - 0:28:42.800000::I need to be fucked up out of my mind before I get in that fucked studio.
0:28:42.800000 - 0:28:46.800000::I don't want to remember the bars that I just put down in there.
0:28:46.800000 - 0:28:49.800000::I don't want to remember the shit that I just talked about.
0:28:49.800000 - 0:28:51.800000::That's my process.
0:28:51.800000 - 0:28:53.800000::This is a work environment.
0:28:53.800000 - 0:28:55.800000::You got to get to work.
0:28:55.800000 - 0:28:57.800000::Eric showed me this video yesterday.
0:28:57.800000 - 0:28:59.800000::Have you guys not seen this?
0:28:59.800000 - 0:29:00.800000::What did you say?
0:29:00.800000 - 0:29:03.800000::I've seen this yesterday.
0:29:03.800000 - 0:29:05.800000::This is Nicki Minaj interviewing her...
0:29:05.800000 - 0:29:06.800000::Oh yes.
0:29:06.800000 - 0:29:07.800000::...to some of you.
0:29:07.800000 - 0:29:11.800000::Oh, we need Sachin to be producing this shit now.
0:29:11.800000 - 0:29:13.800000::Keep my ass in line.
0:29:13.800000 - 0:29:17.800000::If you're on lunch break right now, if you're eating lunch and you're about to go back to work,
0:29:17.800000 - 0:29:19.800000::and you're like, all right, I got to stop the podcast.
0:29:19.800000 - 0:29:22.800000::Do you still have a favor to just google that clip and give yourself a little chuckle
0:29:22.800000 - 0:29:25.800000::and then go back to work and everybody will be wondering why you're smiling.
0:29:25.800000 - 0:29:26.800000::You can tell him.
0:29:26.800000 - 0:29:27.800000::You got to let him do it.
0:29:27.800000 - 0:29:30.800000::You can tell him how you work.
0:29:30.800000 - 0:29:32.800000::You can tell him how you work.
0:29:32.800000 - 0:29:34.800000::You can tell him how you work.
0:29:34.800000 - 0:29:35.800000::Sachin, he was so serious.
0:29:35.800000 - 0:29:38.800000::He was so fucking serious.
0:29:38.800000 - 0:29:40.800000::And they didn't make a reality film.
0:29:40.800000 - 0:29:42.800000::She's crazy.
0:29:42.800000 - 0:29:47.800000::And if that's really a horrible disease that's making his voice sound as such,
0:29:47.800000 - 0:29:53.800000::I will be donating $10 to $100 to a cause of my choice.
0:29:53.800000 - 0:29:54.800000::Oh.
0:29:54.800000 - 0:29:58.800000::Not till I hear the thing about the sub-sets of Tess.

0:30:00 - 0:30:02.320000::Yeah, substance abuse.
0:30:02.320000 - 0:30:07.820000::Can you smoke crack and keep it on track?
0:30:07.820000 - 0:30:09.980000::Smoking crack on track.
0:30:09.980000 - 0:30:10.980000::Good question.
0:30:10.980000 - 0:30:11.980000::Which is about that.
0:30:11.980000 - 0:30:12.980000::This is something that I'm not gonna ask.
0:30:12.980000 - 0:30:18.600000::A lot of people think that it could be done as a therapy or a assistive drug, right?
0:30:18.600000 - 0:30:21.640000::Every drug affects everybody differently.
0:30:21.640000 - 0:30:27.960000::When I go and do my short films and I'm needing to get it to get to the next level and that
0:30:27.960000 - 0:30:29.960000::director's writing my ass.
0:30:29.960000 - 0:30:30.960000::Yeah.
0:30:30.960000 - 0:30:32.960000::You're not getting a fan on your own.
0:30:32.960000 - 0:30:37.960000::You got a 19 year old from NYU, like dragging you across the parking lot.
0:30:37.960000 - 0:30:47.960000::When the Columbia student is fucking giving me a swishy, what did they call swirly?
0:30:47.960000 - 0:30:48.960000::Swirly.
0:30:48.960000 - 0:30:51.960000::Bullying you like an 80s high school with it today.
0:30:51.960000 - 0:30:54.480000::But yeah, let's just say I will turn to substances.
0:30:54.480000 - 0:30:57.920000::I will abuse Adderall by Vance.
0:30:57.920000 - 0:31:00.160000::You can abuse a fucking banana.
0:31:00.160000 - 0:31:01.440000::Do you know what I'm saying?
0:31:01.440000 - 0:31:02.920000::I know you can, dude.
0:31:02.920000 - 0:31:05.400000::There's a difference between use and abuse.
0:31:05.400000 - 0:31:07.440000::So you have to know your limits.
0:31:07.440000 - 0:31:11.240000::How many pipes can I hit before I go pull up to work?
0:31:11.240000 - 0:31:12.240000::Is it zero?
0:31:12.240000 - 0:31:17.680000::For most people it's zero or you'll get fired and you'll lose your families.
0:31:17.680000 - 0:31:18.680000::And this goes for added.
0:31:18.680000 - 0:31:19.680000::Oh, for God's chosen.
0:31:19.680000 - 0:31:20.680000::This isn't just for music.
0:31:20.680000 - 0:31:26.080000::I don't want people to think that it's just so funny to me when I reflect on my time
0:31:26.080000 - 0:31:28.480000::when I was on track to become a lawyer.
0:31:28.480000 - 0:31:31::I was in law school, UVA.
0:31:31 - 0:31:34.080000::I was wondering like I've come into the comedy scene.
0:31:34.080000 - 0:31:38.760000::I'd be like, dang, there are so many parallels that I see.
0:31:38.760000 - 0:31:42.640000::So you think it's just creatives who are abusing drugs, but the white collar corporate
0:31:42.640000 - 0:31:44.640000::world that I used to be in part all.
0:31:44.640000 - 0:31:45.640000::Trust me.
0:31:45.640000 - 0:31:46.920000::We're doing ludes, man.
0:31:46.920000 - 0:31:47.920000::We're doing ludes.
0:31:47.920000 - 0:31:49.240000::I have this friend, Jonah Hill.
0:31:49.240000 - 0:31:55.360000::Me and him used to get fucking luted out.
0:31:55.360000 - 0:31:57.680000::I remember that amazing movie.
0:31:57.680000 - 0:32:03.360000::Martin Scorsese coming out with another killers of the flower moon.
0:32:03.360000 - 0:32:07.800000::He's done it again and apparently people are saying this is a top five.
0:32:07.800000 - 0:32:09.320000::Is it are people saying it's such?
0:32:09.320000 - 0:32:12.680000::I just saw that someone said this is a top five Scorsese.
0:32:12.680000 - 0:32:17.280000::Be a musician to my ear to my ears to hear that.
0:32:17.280000 - 0:32:22.120000::I'm seeing it's more right straight up.
0:32:22.120000 - 0:32:23.120000::Shout out to Martin Scorsese.
0:32:23.120000 - 0:32:25.720000::May the, yeah.
0:32:25.720000 - 0:32:30.720000::What would your guys, because you know what I love about musicians, is that they can
0:32:30.720000 - 0:32:34.440000::disappear into a different person, a different alien.
0:32:34.440000 - 0:32:37.040000::The weekend becomes the weekend.
0:32:37.040000 - 0:32:38.040000::Right.
0:32:38.040000 - 0:32:39.040000::Able becomes the weekend.
0:32:39.040000 - 0:32:40.040000::Yeah.
0:32:40.040000 - 0:32:44.360000::Before he said the weekend becomes the weekend.
0:32:44.360000 - 0:32:48.080000::Which doesn't make sense, but yes.
0:32:48.080000 - 0:32:51.200000::So what is your guys' alternate persona?
0:32:51.200000 - 0:32:52.200000::You know what I'm saying?
0:32:52.200000 - 0:32:56.720000::Because I would love to disappear into a different person and become sort of a performance
0:32:56.720000 - 0:33:00.440000::artist, type character almost.
0:33:00.440000 - 0:33:02.760000::You can create a new character as a musician.
0:33:02.760000 - 0:33:08.680000::As a comedian, you have to be yourself or a version of yourself.
0:33:08.680000 - 0:33:09.680000::Which I love that.
0:33:09.680000 - 0:33:15.720000::What do you, do you guys have a persona that, a name or sort of a style or a vibe that
0:33:15.720000 - 0:33:19.560000::you would like to sort of embody as a musical artist?
0:33:19.560000 - 0:33:24.680000::If you were to go down that road, which I feel like we all will at some point in our
0:33:24.680000 - 0:33:25.680000::career.
0:33:25.680000 - 0:33:27.880000::We definitely will be doing that.
0:33:27.880000 - 0:33:29.880000::I know I will.
0:33:29.880000 - 0:33:30.880000::Sooner than you can.
0:33:30.880000 - 0:33:34.120000::I think I would be fully silent in my day today.
0:33:34.120000 - 0:33:35.120000::No interviews.
0:33:35.120000 - 0:33:37.640000::You know how Lou Reed used to give interviews, I'll pissed off.
0:33:37.640000 - 0:33:40.120000::Well, I'd give interviews, not speaking a word.
0:33:40.120000 - 0:33:42.120000::Mouse shut.
0:33:42.120000 - 0:33:43.120000::You know who's got the best place to be?
0:33:43.120000 - 0:33:45.960000::You're like the Mr. Bean of Music.
0:33:46.960000 - 0:33:50.840000::Yeah, I would be the Mr. Bean of Music.
0:33:50.840000 - 0:33:55.040000::Being able to feel like falling over, tripping over shit, causing the I full tower to fall
0:33:55.040000 - 0:33:58.240000::down because I took out a bolt in one of them or something like this.
0:33:58.240000 - 0:33:59.240000::That's actually genius.
0:33:59.240000 - 0:34:04.520000::There's a backing band and the front man doesn't even sing.
0:34:04.520000 - 0:34:09.080000::The front man is just kind of doing pratfalls and that's a genius.
0:34:09.080000 - 0:34:10.080000::I know it is.
0:34:10.080000 - 0:34:13.680000::You need to be doing music producing.
0:34:14.680000 - 0:34:18::Can I tell you guys my name?
0:34:18 - 0:34:19::Yeah.
0:34:19 - 0:34:20.160000::What would it be?
0:34:20.160000 - 0:34:22.720000::I don't have anything past this name.
0:34:22.720000 - 0:34:29.600000::Maybe this is a part of a larger group, like the G unit type of thing, the St. Lunatics.
0:34:29.600000 - 0:34:33.520000::But I think my name should be the City Dick Wizard.
0:34:33.520000 - 0:34:36.600000::The City Dick Wizard?
0:34:36.600000 - 0:34:37.600000::Oh.
0:34:37.600000 - 0:34:39.600000::Yeah.
0:34:39.600000 - 0:34:46.120000::And maybe City Dick Wizard.
0:34:46.120000 - 0:34:48.720000::And then my crew could be like the City Dick Boys.
0:34:48.720000 - 0:34:53.440000::Like we're all like, it's like, what do you guys think about that?
0:34:53.440000 - 0:34:55.480000::So well, I'm loving it.
0:34:55.480000 - 0:34:56.480000::I'm in awe.
0:34:56.480000 - 0:34:57.480000::That's why I'm being quiet.
0:34:57.480000 - 0:34:58.480000::I'm just trying to process.
0:34:58.480000 - 0:34:59.880000::Do you have a crazy wizard?

0:35:00 - 0:35:05.660000::Wizardly hat is I could featured in every song is it wrap around you like a belt

0:35:12.260000 - 0:35:17.480000::I'm well, I told you I just have a name right now dude. I don't have anything past that so we're working it out right now
0:35:17.480000 - 0:35:22.540000::What my fucking persona could be maybe I maybe I do roll with the wizard type shit. I wear a wizard hat
0:35:22.540000 - 0:35:26.640000::And I'm smoking gonna be careful with wizard all types right

0:51:33.720000 - 0:51:40.240000::It was a very good year for small town girls and soft.
0:51:40.240000 - 0:51:47.240000::The vibrato.
0:51:47.240000 - 0:51:57.240000::And then he goes through every year of his...
0:51:57.240000 - 0:52:02.240000::Well, then I would make up layers to go through every single year of my life.
0:52:02.240000 - 0:52:07.240000::Do we have permission?
0:52:07.240000 - 0:52:12.240000::Do we have permission if your death is filmed on video?
0:52:12.240000 - 0:52:16.240000::Like, somebody's filming you die, like to put that...
0:52:16.240000 - 0:52:19.240000::You singing, clip it over, that, you know what I'm saying?
0:52:19.240000 - 0:52:22.240000::Do we have that permission?
0:52:22.240000 - 0:52:23.240000::Yeah.
0:52:23.240000 - 0:52:25.240000::Okay.
0:52:25.240000 - 0:52:29.240000::Like if somebody shoots you down on my luck, I'm like robbing a bunch of 12-year-olds
0:52:29.240000 - 0:52:32.240000::and they gang up on me and I'll kill me.
0:52:32.240000 - 0:52:35.240000::I can't wait until...
0:52:35.240000 - 0:52:37.240000::Oh.
0:52:37.240000 - 0:52:41.240000::Wait, show the cat Williams cut right now, Jack.

0:52:43.240000 - 0:52:45.240000::Let's see it, dude.
0:52:45.240000 - 0:52:47.240000::Who did that to you?
0:52:47.240000 - 0:52:49.240000::You know, rockin'...
0:52:49.240000 - 0:52:50.240000::What did they say?
0:52:50.240000 - 0:52:53.240000::And I'm the newest member of the Rock-A-Fell-A-Team.
0:52:53.240000 - 0:52:56.240000::Jesus.
0:52:56.240000 - 0:52:57.240000::Jesus.
0:52:57.240000 - 0:52:59.240000::No, it was all fanned out when you first...
0:52:59.240000 - 0:53:00.240000::Yeah, yeah.
0:53:00.240000 - 0:53:02.240000::Get that very strange style.
0:53:02.240000 - 0:53:05.240000::Yeah, those are the ponytail berries and cream.
0:53:05.240000 - 0:53:07.240000::Oh, shit.
0:53:07.240000 - 0:53:09.240000::The Bushwick berries and cream.
0:53:09.240000 - 0:53:11.240000::Oh my god.
0:53:11.240000 - 0:53:13.240000::When you texted that, and I had a house...
0:53:13.240000 - 0:53:15.240000::That was good.
0:53:15.240000 - 0:53:16.240000::That was a good one, man.
0:53:16.240000 - 0:53:19.240000::You're looking like the Lord fucking far quad.
0:53:19.240000 - 0:53:26.240000::I'm looking like the Lord, but like the...
0:53:26.240000 - 0:53:27.240000::I don't know.
0:53:27.240000 - 0:53:29.240000::General manager, far quad.
0:53:29.240000 - 0:53:31.240000::Regional manager, far quad.
0:53:31.240000 - 0:53:32.240000::Here's the thing.
0:53:32.240000 - 0:53:33.240000::I was looking for...
0:53:33.240000 - 0:53:36.240000::At least, maybe, because you got to cover that hair up.
0:53:36.240000 - 0:53:38.240000::Stop, bitch.
0:53:38.240000 - 0:53:39.240000::Enough.
0:53:39.240000 - 0:53:40.240000::Enough.
0:53:40.240000 - 0:53:41.240000::Too far.
0:53:41.240000 - 0:53:42.240000::Okay.
0:53:42.240000 - 0:53:43.240000::I was wanting to get a haircut.
0:53:43.240000 - 0:53:46.240000::I was in Crown Heights, and I walked into...
0:53:46.240000 - 0:53:51.240000::N. Orthodox Jewish barbershop straight up.
0:53:51.240000 - 0:53:54.240000::And I got the fade.
0:53:54.240000 - 0:54:00.240000::And I walked out looking like the Orthodox type of guy.
0:54:00.240000 - 0:54:03.240000::Did they have any snacks?
0:54:03.240000 - 0:54:05.240000::Did they have any snacks there?
0:54:05.240000 - 0:54:06.240000::No.
0:54:06.240000 - 0:54:09.240000::And he loved common barbershop has snacks.
0:54:09.240000 - 0:54:13.240000::Oh, so let me fucking go then.
0:54:13.240000 - 0:54:17.240000::Chop it up about Chris Katan.
0:54:17.240000 - 0:54:19.240000::Yeah, that was interesting.
0:54:19.240000 - 0:54:27.240000::He was a big, Shane Gillis fan and had no idea of the SNL of it all.
0:54:27.240000 - 0:54:29.240000::Which I guess is probably the most interesting thing.
0:54:29.240000 - 0:54:31.240000::I was educated at the time.
0:54:31.240000 - 0:54:32.240000::And you educated him.
0:54:32.240000 - 0:54:34.240000::I pretended I didn't speak English the whole time.
0:54:34.240000 - 0:54:39.240000::He did speak Russian, and I was popping off on him a little bit.
0:54:39.240000 - 0:54:40.240000::Yablika.
0:54:40.240000 - 0:54:41.240000::And...
0:54:41.240000 - 0:54:44.240000::Shout out in the comments if you know what Yablika means right now.
0:54:44.240000 - 0:54:45.240000::Don't google it.
0:54:45.240000 - 0:54:49.240000::So what did you say to the barber to get that haircut?
0:54:49.240000 - 0:54:51.240000::Like, what did you go in with?
0:54:51.240000 - 0:54:54.240000::Because there had to be some sort of...
0:54:54.240000 - 0:54:55.240000::You know what they asked you?
0:54:55.240000 - 0:54:56.240000::What do you want?
0:54:56.240000 - 0:54:57.240000::You know what I said?
0:54:57.240000 - 0:55:00.240000::I just showed him a picture of a banana peel.

0:55:00 - 0:55:02::from Mario Kart and I said,
0:55:02 - 0:55:03::you know what I'm doing?
0:55:03 - 0:55:04::Sir.
0:55:04 - 0:55:05::Oh, I said,
0:55:05 - 0:55:06::it was like,
0:55:06 - 0:55:07::fucking half an inch off,
0:55:07 - 0:55:08::whatever, give me a trim.
0:55:08 - 0:55:09::Like, don't even worry about it.
0:55:09 - 0:55:11::He just had no concept of like layering
0:55:11 - 0:55:13::or like, whatever you'd call it.
0:55:13 - 0:55:14::I don't know what it,
0:55:14 - 0:55:15::something like that, right?
0:55:15 - 0:55:16::Is it blending layering?
0:55:16 - 0:55:17::Where it was,
0:55:17 - 0:55:18::it wasn't,
0:55:18 - 0:55:21::he wasn't cutting anything other than like the end of the hair.
0:55:21 - 0:55:24::As if you were cutting like a piece of paper,
0:55:24 - 0:55:25::a shape out of a piece of paper.
0:55:25 - 0:55:26::There was no,
0:55:26 - 0:55:27::he wasn't cutting this and this.
0:55:27 - 0:55:29::He was just cutting the bottom.
0:55:29 - 0:55:31::He kept all the thickness and it,
0:55:31 - 0:55:32::like, you know what I'm saying?
0:55:32 - 0:55:33::It was like a,
0:55:33 - 0:55:34::it was like a free hand,
0:55:34 - 0:55:36::it was like a fucking free solo bowl cut.
0:55:36 - 0:55:37::You know what I'm saying?
0:55:37 - 0:55:39::Like, no bowl just going around.
0:55:39 - 0:55:40::Imaginary loop.
0:55:40 - 0:55:43::It looks like your haircut was interrupted by like the
0:55:43 - 0:55:45::ottomans like knocking down your rock gate
0:55:45 - 0:55:47::and you fucking gotta run to the,
0:55:47 - 0:55:48::yeah, yeah.
0:55:48 - 0:55:50::Run to the fucking castle walls.
0:55:50 - 0:55:52::It's funny because I was talking to him about like,
0:55:52 - 0:55:55::do you think you could do this with no scissors?
0:55:55 - 0:55:56::Like, what the fuck would you do?
0:55:56 - 0:55:58::Would you just put it against your hand and get a rock
0:55:58 - 0:56:00::and just like go out my fucking hair with a,
0:56:00 - 0:56:01::ah, wait.
0:56:01 - 0:56:03::Question, question.
0:56:03 - 0:56:07::Were they using rocks to cut hair back in the day?
0:56:07 - 0:56:09::Sharp ass rocks, slate.
0:56:09 - 0:56:11::First ever, were they biting it off?
0:56:11 - 0:56:12::Oh, you know what?
0:56:12 - 0:56:14::Having a local hair bider with them, sharp ass teeth.
0:56:14 - 0:56:16::Going crazy down here,
0:56:16 - 0:56:17::giving you a fade.
0:56:17 - 0:56:19::Well, this is what the barber said to that.
0:56:19 - 0:56:21::As he said, you know who probably got the first ever haircut
0:56:21 - 0:56:23::was Adam when he picked that apple.
0:56:23 - 0:56:24::He probably wasn't happy about that.
0:56:24 - 0:56:26::Probably cut his hair.
0:56:27 - 0:56:29::I don't really see that.
0:56:29 - 0:56:34::Yeah, this is somebody who is not from the same environment
0:56:34 - 0:56:35::that we are from.
0:56:35 - 0:56:37::What does that joke mean?
0:56:37 - 0:56:38::Is that Adam had this arm hair?
0:56:38 - 0:56:40::Russian, where's this person's,
0:56:40 - 0:56:42::his first language was Russian.
0:56:42 - 0:56:44::So he's, he's saying you can imagine if,
0:56:44 - 0:56:46::if Adam are,
0:56:46 - 0:56:49::Adam, when he ate the apple,
0:56:49 - 0:56:50::he got to cut his hair.
0:56:50 - 0:56:52::Eve ate the apple, dude.
0:56:52 - 0:56:54::That's why I knew that.
0:56:54 - 0:56:57::I wish I knew that at the time I would have spanked him.
0:56:57 - 0:56:58::spanked him.
0:56:58 - 0:57:00::Yeah, well,
0:57:00 - 0:57:02::I love getting haircuts from Russian people.
0:57:02 - 0:57:05::They give the most busted fucking haircuts in the world.
0:57:05 - 0:57:08::You do, you can't say that about a population, dude.
0:57:08 - 0:57:10::Can I tell you guys from your wrong?
0:57:10 - 0:57:12::Please, man.
0:57:12 - 0:57:13::What the fuck you're about to say?
0:57:13 - 0:57:20::I haven't had a haircut from a hair cutlery in probably
0:57:20 - 0:57:23::six years.
0:57:23 - 0:57:26::Because I do my own shit.
0:57:26 - 0:57:28::Do you want to come to my workshop?
0:57:28 - 0:57:30::To my barber next time.
0:57:30 - 0:57:32::You're saying my house?
0:57:32 - 0:57:33::Because it's so nice.
0:57:33 - 0:57:35::It's, hey, you like ASMR, right?
0:57:35 - 0:57:37::Yeah.
0:57:37 - 0:57:39::I, no, I don't actually, but,
0:57:39 - 0:57:40::do they,
0:57:40 - 0:57:43::they just make it so nice on it.
0:57:43 - 0:57:45::My barber, you can't find him on Google Maps.
0:57:45 - 0:57:46::There's no store,
0:57:46 - 0:57:47::there's no reviews.
0:57:47 - 0:57:49::It's just this shop called out.

0:58:01 - 0:58:05::You think your baldness will go to a nice, nice place, man.
0:58:05 - 0:58:07::I shouldn't open a barber shop.
0:58:07 - 0:58:10::Who is the fucking guy who did?
0:58:10 - 0:58:12::Someone has a funny fucking joke.
0:58:12 - 0:58:15::His name is Carmen Christopher shout out about haircuts.
0:58:15 - 0:58:18::I'm not gonna spoil it.

0:58:21 - 0:58:23::Go ahead, go find him.
0:58:23 - 0:58:24::That should be our whole podcast.
0:58:24 - 0:58:25::It's just like, you know,
0:58:25 - 0:58:26::who has a good ass song?
0:58:26 - 0:58:29::And I don't want to even mention what it sounds like.
0:58:29 - 0:58:30::But,
0:58:30 - 0:58:33::if I can crossbe stills and Nash.
0:58:33 - 0:58:36::We can really get into it too hard about our favorite artists.
0:58:36 - 0:58:37::We'll be going through, we'll,
0:58:37 - 0:58:38::you know what,
0:58:38 - 0:58:41::we're gonna be doing decades pretty soon here, like CNN does the 1970s
0:58:41 - 0:58:43::and the 60s.
0:58:43 - 0:58:45::So we'll get into our favorite artists at some point.
0:58:45 - 0:58:46::But music industry,
0:58:46 - 0:58:49::this is, you're on watch right now.
0:58:49 - 0:58:52::You're on joy tactics to watch.
0:58:52 - 0:58:55::So be careful with how you,
0:58:55 - 0:58:59::and if you are a musician and you want to send us some music,
0:58:59 - 0:59:04::we are putting together a sort of new independent,
0:59:04 - 0:59:08::yes, we are a label and we do have kind of a fucked up contract
0:59:08 - 0:59:11::that will let you, that you have to sign.
0:59:11 - 0:59:12::And, you know,
0:59:12 - 0:59:15::we are gonna take advantage of you and make money off of you.
0:59:15 - 0:59:18::But we're giving you that exposure.
0:59:18 - 0:59:20::And in a lot of senses,
0:59:20 - 0:59:21::we're not even gonna let you make music.
0:59:21 - 0:59:24::We're actually signing you to this contract to get rid of the competition.
0:59:24 - 0:59:25::Right. Right.
0:59:25 - 0:59:28::And we only work directly with hospitals and hospices.
0:59:28 - 0:59:30::This will be for end of life care.
0:59:30 - 0:59:32::Different kinds of music.
0:59:32 - 0:59:34::And the music has got to fit that vibe.
0:59:34 - 0:59:35::Right, right.
0:59:35 - 0:59:36::People had different tastes.
0:59:36 - 0:59:39::So whatever, you know, whatever.
0:59:39 - 0:59:41::So send us your short of life.
0:59:41 - 0:59:43::And it's gonna be an orchestra style too.
0:59:43 - 0:59:44::Your gospel.
0:59:44 - 0:59:47::Oh, I do want to say this about orchestra's.
0:59:47 - 0:59:50::Sometimes I'll be listening to you heard me sing Frank Sinatra
0:59:50 - 0:59:53::and it sounded like you were listening to an MP3 of the man himself.
0:59:53 - 0:59:56::So I was like six minutes ago.
0:59:56 - 0:59:58::But sometimes you,
0:59:58 - 1:00:00::okay, when I listen to his orchestra,

1:00:08.280000 - 1:00:13.440000::Percussion as well. I think I nailed all of them. It just sounds so clean and amazing
1:00:13.560000 - 1:00:20.200000::Can we bring some of that back the big band orchestral big band style big band or a big band supporting a
1:00:21.480000 - 1:00:23.480000::Golden Voiced
1:00:23.480000 - 1:00:29.280000::Manor music as they sing you know who you know who tried to do that. I feel like
