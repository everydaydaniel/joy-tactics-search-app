0:08:54.480000 - 0:08:59.520000::in like a giant labyrinth maze of a hotel and who do I see with a nose strip on sitting
0:08:59.520000 - 0:09:05.040000::on a bench in an abandoned with his eyes closed in an abandoned hallway is neighbor on doing
0:09:05.040000 - 0:09:08.080000::meditation and his eyebrows are twitching around like a bacon on a griddle.
0:09:08.080000 - 0:09:09.080000::Really?

0:09:14.560000 - 0:09:19.760000::When I do meditation something something happens to my face.
0:09:19.760000 - 0:09:20.560000::You want to see it?
0:09:20.560000 - 0:09:26.320000::I don't know and I went to a kind of there's like a refresher where you kind of like relearned
0:09:26.320000 - 0:09:32.480000::meditation and I asked them like is your face kind of supposed to like you know move in the
0:09:32.480000 - 0:09:38.720000::ways that it does when I do it and the meditation teacher was like kind of brushed it off and
0:09:38.720000 - 0:09:43.520000::was like everyone kind of meditates in their own way and I was like what are meditations
0:09:43.520000 - 0:09:47.440000::like for you like I was like trying to like put the ball in a record and she was like it's
0:09:47.440000 - 0:09:50.480000::just like yours like Sam is that is not and I was like.
0:09:50.720000 - 0:09:55.440000::But do you do your face kind of move all crazy and weird I don't know I'm maybe I'm doing a
0:09:55.440000 - 0:09:57.600000::different type of meditation.
0:09:57.600000 - 0:10:00::I am your face moving while it's happening.

0:10:00 - 0:10:05.460000::Yes, yeah, it just like twitches like there's a twitching like it kind of looks like this like where my eyebrows are kind of like
0:10:11.460000 - 0:10:17.220000::Wait no, I remember I told you this I am over hydrated, but maybe that's it
0:10:17.220000 - 0:10:19.720000::Eric's the hydrated. He just got up and started shaking
0:10:22.700000 - 0:10:25.220000::Let's see if there's something cold here
0:10:25.580000 - 0:10:30.580000::Well Jack figures of the AC I'm actually gonna love all my theories about your eyebrow wagling
0:10:30.580000 - 0:10:36.180000::Okay, I love your man all of your like and I'm not called labeling you as manic
0:10:36.180000 - 0:10:39.020000::But you can all of that manic energy
0:10:39.980000 - 0:10:46.860000::That you have throughout the day that kind of is your motor is your engine when your tuned in and dropped out and you're in your
0:10:46.860000 - 0:10:48.360000::meditation zone
0:10:48.480000 - 0:10:55.520000::Maybe it all that energy gets channeled into the micro facial muscles that that has to be it
0:10:55.520000 - 0:11:00.160000::I've never heard a better I feel like you just unlocked something inside of my meditation
0:11:00.160000 - 0:11:05.160000::I understand it more. What is your visualization when you're meditating is it like there's a cord?
0:11:06.120000 - 0:11:08.120000::Of what is it numbers?
0:11:08.600000 - 0:11:10.600000::Total dark black
0:11:10.600000 - 0:11:12.600000::There's really
0:11:14.840000 - 0:11:19.600000::But you I mean you die, but you're diving deeper into nothingness and darkness
0:11:19.600000 - 0:11:27.320000::But do you feel yourself like like do you feel yourself falling in any kind of way or like because I'm trying to like
0:11:27.320000 - 0:11:29.960000::I'm like well, maybe you're picturing like
0:11:31 - 0:11:33.600000::It's something face forward or something
0:11:34.440000 - 0:11:38.440000::You guys talk about my facial muscles a little bit. Yeah
0:11:39.440000 - 0:11:41.440000::Um
0:11:41.440000 - 0:11:47.400000::I'm wondering if the your eyebrows are a manifestation of whatever visualization
0:11:47.400000 - 0:11:49.560000::You're using well, what are eyebrows metaphorically?
0:11:50.440000 - 0:11:52.440000::eyebrows

0:17:10 - 0:17:20::So Sarah, walk us through the week because on SNL, what you wake up Monday morning and then at this point, uh, what?
0:17:20 - 0:17:22::I was like, there's an idea in my head.
0:17:22 - 0:17:31::And then it takes me two full days to write this pretty page script that then I sent Dan Bull and I go, there's 30 pages here.
0:17:31 - 0:17:32::Is there something?
0:17:32 - 0:17:34::You shrink the font, make it shorter.
0:17:34 - 0:17:35::You shrink the font, make it shorter.
0:17:35 - 0:17:36::Dan, can you shrink the font?
0:17:36 - 0:17:42::And then two weeks ago, as Eric knows very well, we're at Table Read, which is five hours long.
0:17:42 - 0:17:43::And I'm, we don't have any.
0:17:43 - 0:17:49::And this is where you, when you read all the sketches, which, yeah, you read a table down.
0:17:49 - 0:17:50::No, not that.
0:17:50 - 0:17:54::You go, yeah, you go, you're, you're so fat.
0:17:54 - 0:17:56::You might as well be an otter.

0:17:58 - 0:17:59::There's a table.
0:17:59 - 0:18:00::The roast of a table.
0:18:00 - 0:18:03::Comedy Central roast, Sarah's sharing a roast of a table.
0:18:03 - 0:18:05::Dave is laughing at a pity.
0:18:05 - 0:18:09::We're handing you the mic right now and you're crushing it.
0:18:09 - 0:18:10::That's what it says.
0:18:10 - 0:18:11::Okay.
0:18:11 - 0:18:13::So we do the table read and then it's like five hours.
0:18:13 - 0:18:18::You read all the sketches everybody wrote the night before and as everybody knows that this bed right now, maybe?
0:18:18 - 0:18:26::Maybe Nate doesn't know this, but two weeks ago, I'm reading a sketch and I start getting really, really hot.
0:18:26 - 0:18:40::And I start sweating profusely and I go, oh my god, this sketch needs to end right now because I have to throw up now.
0:18:40 - 0:18:43::And the sketch mercifully ends.
0:18:43 - 0:18:46::I'm hilarious sketched by the way and I was being hilarious and it was well.
0:18:46 - 0:18:50::Of course, many, many, many laughs of a table.
0:18:50 - 0:18:51::Yes.
0:18:51 - 0:18:59::And I get up slowly from my seat, calmly push my chair and I walk to the door.
0:18:59 - 0:19:08::I shut the door behind me and then I immediately start sprinting to the nearest bathroom doing the math in my head of like, okay, well,
0:19:08 - 0:19:14::the closer bathroom actually is close to a room where a lot of people are and they could probably hear something.
0:19:14 - 0:19:17::So I was doing the quick like math, like carry the two carry the one with that room.
0:19:17 - 0:19:20::I could go into my room and chill there and chill with him.
0:19:20 - 0:19:24::Oh man, Michael says, damn.
0:19:24 - 0:19:27::And I ran to the bathroom with Seth Meyers.

0:19:45 - 0:19:46::No, no.
