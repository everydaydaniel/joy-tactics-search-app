0:00:00 - 0:00:05.140000::Well, this makes me curious about the East and West Poles which haven't been discovered yet.
0:00:05.140000 - 0:00:06.140000::The East Pole?
0:00:06.140000 - 0:00:11.100000::HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
0:00:11.100000 - 0:00:12.500000::HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
0:00:12.500000 - 0:00:14.560000::You have such a great one!
0:00:14.560000 - 0:00:16.440000::No one's found that shit yet.
0:00:16.440000 - 0:00:17.800000::HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
0:00:17.800000 - 0:00:19.460000::Eric, you are a genius man.
0:00:19.460000 - 0:00:22.940000::That might be actually the smartest thing I've ever heard in the most same outfit.

0:00:37.440000 - 0:00:40.240000::Wow.
0:00:40.240000 - 0:00:41.800000::No one's expecting this from us.
0:00:41.800000 - 0:00:42.800000::I'll just say that.
0:00:42.800000 - 0:00:48.240000::No one was expecting that that would happen so soon.
0:00:48.240000 - 0:00:52.840000::But we continue to surprise in crazy ways.
0:00:52.840000 - 0:00:54::It's the sequel.
0:00:54 - 0:00:55.640000::It's the comeback.
0:00:55.640000 - 0:00:58.200000::It's lunch part two.
0:00:58.200000 - 0:00:59.200000::We got it.
0:00:59.200000 - 0:01:00.200000::We told y'all.
0:01:00.200000 - 0:01:02.440000::We got it already intellectually in the first one.
0:01:02.440000 - 0:01:04.200000::But we didn't get into it.
0:01:04.200000 - 0:01:08.200000::Meet more emotionally and personally.
0:01:08.200000 - 0:01:09.480000::We didn't touch it personally.
0:01:09.480000 - 0:01:11.120000::We didn't touch it emotionally.
0:01:11.120000 - 0:01:17.140000::We barely even touched our favorite types of lunch or the history of lunch.
0:01:17.140000 - 0:01:21.160000::We kind of, I think I said everything I have to say about lunch.
0:01:21.160000 - 0:01:22.880000::I left it on table now.
0:01:22.880000 - 0:01:26.280000::I put everything I had in that fucking podcast.
0:01:26.280000 - 0:01:27.280000::Dig deep.
0:01:27.280000 - 0:01:31.840000::One, I said everything I have to say there's nothing fucking left that I can possibly say
0:01:31.840000 - 0:01:32.840000::about fucking lunch.
0:01:32.840000 - 0:01:33.840000::I don't.
0:01:33.840000 - 0:01:34.840000::Well, then you guys are dry.
0:01:34.840000 - 0:01:36.080000::No, we have to do the part two.
0:01:36.080000 - 0:01:37.480000::We have to do the part two.
0:01:37.480000 - 0:01:38.480000::I don't fuck.
0:01:38.480000 - 0:01:39.480000::Get.
0:01:39.480000 - 0:01:42.880000::Hey, really quick, real quick, Nate, can we reset, dude?
0:01:42.880000 - 0:01:44.880000::I don't like.
0:01:44.880000 - 0:01:47.240000::I don't like how you're coming into this.
0:01:47.240000 - 0:01:49.720000::I'll just, I'll just let the listeners know.
0:01:49.720000 - 0:01:50.720000::Okay.
0:01:50.800000 - 0:01:55.520000::Last night I did a crazy ass show that you probably couldn't even believe that I was doing.
0:01:55.520000 - 0:01:59::Just continuing to dominate LA.
0:01:59 - 0:02:00::Political fundraiser.
0:02:00 - 0:02:03.860000::He went to an open like, and then you get picked and fuck it and just sat there all the
0:02:03.860000 - 0:02:04.860000::time.
0:02:04.860000 - 0:02:08.600000::Not but, but I made some friends and we had, I mean, we made lunch plans to tie it to
0:02:08.600000 - 0:02:09.600000::the episode.
0:02:09.600000 - 0:02:14.040000::But then I'm like off the high from the crazy ass show and the networking.
0:02:14.040000 - 0:02:17.040000::And so I say, Nate, let me pick your ass up right now.
0:02:17.040000 - 0:02:18.040000::It's 10 30.
0:02:18.040000 - 0:02:19.800000::Let's go get a drink right now.
0:02:19.800000 - 0:02:26.240000::I'm not going to blow our spot up, but it's called the grant.
0:02:26.240000 - 0:02:31.440000::And we go to the bar and I'm like, I'll have one of their special martinis, please.
0:02:31.440000 - 0:02:33.720000::Nate goes, NBA.
0:02:33.720000 - 0:02:38.280000::And I look at him, I go, you realize it's Friday, right?
0:02:38.280000 - 0:02:43::And yeah, so just so you all know, I had a martini and a mezcal last night.
0:02:43 - 0:02:44.520000::Nate had two NBA's.
0:02:44.520000 - 0:02:50.720000::I'm coming into this episode with pure good vibes, even though I had two drinks and Nate
0:02:50.720000 - 0:02:53.360000::said nothing, Nate's coming in all sourd out.
0:02:53.360000 - 0:02:56.200000::Yeah, no idea what's going on.
0:02:56.200000 - 0:03:01.280000::So Nate, maybe there was, well, you know what, you ordered the second beer for me.
0:03:01.280000 - 0:03:08.400000::So I, you think I would dose one of my closest friends with alcohol without their permission?
0:03:08.400000 - 0:03:13.800000::Think again, I would do a lot of things, but I would not do that.
0:03:13.800000 - 0:03:16.480000::Nate, what makes you?
0:03:16.480000 - 0:03:17.480000::Let's just come on.
0:03:17.480000 - 0:03:18.480000::Let's just paint a pain.
0:03:18.480000 - 0:03:19.480000::Is it?
0:03:19.480000 - 0:03:20.480000::Yeah.
0:03:20.480000 - 0:03:24.320000::Is it the fear of pain that stops you from enjoying?
0:03:24.320000 - 0:03:33.280000::Because the pain of not doing yourself, you know, is deeper than fuck.
0:03:33.280000 - 0:03:34.760000::So Nate, you have a, yeah, exactly.
0:03:34.760000 - 0:03:40.080000::You have a predilection for, you have a predilection as they say for nicotine, right?
0:03:40.080000 - 0:03:42.080000::You have a predilection, wow.
0:03:42.080000 - 0:03:44.560000::And you don't like alcohol.
0:03:44.560000 - 0:03:48.240000::You don't like things being out of your control.
0:03:48.240000 - 0:03:52.680000::So I think you like the nicotine because you feel like it locks you into reality.
0:03:52.680000 - 0:03:55.400000::And I'm in control and there's no hangover from this.
0:03:55.400000 - 0:03:57::This won't ever hurt me.
0:03:57 - 0:04:00.440000::I couldn't have a drink of alcohol because then I'm going to be a little out of control
0:04:00.440000 - 0:04:01.440000::the next day.
0:04:01.440000 - 0:04:05.200000::I won't be able to control my emotions and I won't be able to control the hangover.
0:04:05.200000 - 0:04:09.400000::Yeah, my genitalia go control the hangover.
0:04:09.400000 - 0:04:10.840000::You need to let go now.
0:04:10.840000 - 0:04:14.200000::I say release yourself to your inhibitions.
0:04:14.200000 - 0:04:16.520000::I'll tell you what I told you this yesterday.
0:04:16.520000 - 0:04:21::I had two 0.5 liter beers.
0:04:21 - 0:04:26.880000::Okay, these are German style beers at a German beer hall.
0:04:26.880000 - 0:04:31.640000::Okay, two beers at about 5 p.m.
0:04:31.640000 - 0:04:35.160000::Kind of early, you know, in the, in the, earlier in the day.
0:04:35.160000 - 0:04:38.360000::So can I just say you had a liter of beer?
0:04:38.440000 - 0:04:40.640000::Yeah, in one day.
0:04:40.640000 - 0:04:42.440000::That's like a soldier's rations.
0:04:42.440000 - 0:04:43.280000::That's nothing.
0:04:43.280000 - 0:04:44.480000::Okay, that's what they would do.
0:04:44.480000 - 0:04:45.760000::I know I agree.
0:04:45.760000 - 0:04:46.760000::I agree.
0:04:46.760000 - 0:04:47.760000::It's nothing.
0:04:47.760000 - 0:04:56.800000::But after I would say it may be three hours went by and I start having this, this
0:04:56.800000 - 0:05:00::headache happen at about, you know, eight
0:05:00 - 0:05:01::p.m.

0:05:00 - 0:05:04.360000::And it lasted the entire night until I went to bed.
0:05:04.360000 - 0:05:06.720000::And I was like, did I just like,
0:05:06.720000 - 0:05:11.720000::or do you think you're meant to just be drinking at like 10,
0:05:12.280000 - 0:05:13.520000::45 PM?
0:05:13.520000 - 0:05:16.120000::And then in my body, I think was like,
0:05:16.120000 - 0:05:17.560000::you usually, when you're drinking,
0:05:17.560000 - 0:05:22.560000::you're usually like, you know, in bed by now, maybe.
0:05:23.360000 - 0:05:24.360000::Do you think that's what happened?
0:05:24.360000 - 0:05:25.360000::So then it just started.
0:05:25.360000 - 0:05:26.880000::Well, you have to keep it going.
0:05:26.880000 - 0:05:28.040000::Oh, you're skipping sleep.
0:05:28.040000 - 0:05:31.600000::So we're just going to go straight to hangover right now.
0:05:31.600000 - 0:05:32.920000::You have to keep that shit going.
0:05:32.920000 - 0:05:34.840000::You can't start and then stop your body.
0:05:36.120000 - 0:05:39.520000::What that is telling you is your body's craving more of the stuff.
0:05:39.520000 - 0:05:43.280000::Okay. And that's a sign to listen to your body and have one more beer
0:05:43.280000 - 0:05:46::and play a little as Jack would play RuneScape.
0:05:46.760000 - 0:05:47.600000::I wouldn't play that.
0:05:47.600000 - 0:05:49.440000::If you're ever feeling that hit, I don't know what that is.
0:05:52.320000 - 0:05:53.760000::I think there's a big problem.
0:05:54.320000 - 0:05:55.480000::Nate, hold on.
0:05:55.680000 - 0:05:56.840000::I think there's a big problem.
0:05:56.840000 - 0:05:59.840000::I'm sorry to say like that, but I think there's a big problem with people
0:06:00.440000 - 0:06:04.520000::listening to their bodies too much and respecting the body.
0:06:04.840000 - 0:06:08.480000::The bodies meant to do this early, early humans.
0:06:10 - 0:06:12.520000::Our bodies are eating like this, sleeping like this.
0:06:12.520000 - 0:06:13.920000::My body's telling me to do this.
0:06:14.280000 - 0:06:17.240000::Make your body your employee.
0:06:18.400000 - 0:06:25.080000::Do not let your body dictate your mind, your personal and professional endeavors.
0:06:25.120000 - 0:06:26.280000::That's the first mistake.
0:06:26.520000 - 0:06:30.200000::Why do you think we invented new food so that we wouldn't have to listen to our body?
0:06:30.200000 - 0:06:33.640000::But I think we invented wheat so that we could go out and hit the streets and all.
0:06:33.680000 - 0:06:35.600000::Everybody's got a hell of bread in my bag.
0:06:35.600000 - 0:06:39.080000::I don't need to, you know, my body's telling me don't move today.
0:06:39.080000 - 0:06:42.560000::Try to move as little as possible because you don't have bread.
0:06:42.800000 - 0:06:43.680000::Then we make bread.
0:06:43.920000 - 0:06:45.840000::Then we, next thing you know, we make biotin.
0:06:46.080000 - 0:06:49.400000::Next thing you know, we're making lions, main mushroom pills.
0:06:49.440000 - 0:06:50.040000::See what I'm saying?
0:06:50.360000 - 0:06:53.720000::There are remedies to where you could tell your body, fuck you.
0:06:53.880000 - 0:06:55.880000::I'm not listening to you anymore, man.
0:06:56.120000 - 0:06:59.600000::I'm not not doing this shit.
0:07:00.640000 - 0:07:01.640000::I'm drinking.
0:07:02.880000 - 0:07:03.160000::Yeah.
0:07:03.160000 - 0:07:04.400000::What about this phrase?
0:07:06 - 0:07:11.120000::People refer to this when they are talking about their penis and boner.
0:07:11.400000 - 0:07:12.080000::Be careful.
0:07:12.080000 - 0:07:16.360000::They'll say, they'll say he's got a mind of his own.
0:07:17.040000 - 0:07:21.560000::Oh, well, I never heard that.
0:07:21.960000 - 0:07:25.760000::Oh, wait, wait, really quick, really quick.
0:07:25.760000 - 0:07:27.640000::I just, an image came to my mind.
0:07:27.640000 - 0:07:31.400000::Sometimes I have to, I have to relay these images to you guys.
0:07:31.400000 - 0:07:33.120000::No, I don't think about that shit.
0:07:34.640000 - 0:07:40.400000::I, when you said of the invention of wheat, imagine that I'm imagining the invention of wheat.
0:07:40.640000 - 0:07:45.560000::You know, we were hunter-gatherers back in the day, just chilling, hunting down,
0:07:45.600000 - 0:07:52.080000::antelope and mammoths, whatever with spears, sleep sleeping under trees to hide from the rain.
0:07:52.720000 - 0:07:57.120000::That's when the andanaki come down and their rock spaceship made out of essentially rock.
0:07:57.680000 - 0:07:58.320000::And they come down.
0:07:58.320000 - 0:08:02.960000::They see us run around hunting, like so hungry, having to do intermittent fasting to stay alive.
0:08:04 - 0:08:08.680000::And could you imagine that andanaki in their spaceship saying, like, all right,
0:08:08.680000 - 0:08:11.160000::I got some pretty, their eyes rolled back in the back of their head.
0:08:11.440000 - 0:08:12.520000::The spaceship's all rock.
0:08:12.520000 - 0:08:13.760000::There's no buttons in it.
0:08:13.760000 - 0:08:18.240000::Like to us, it would seem like it's just like all smooth rock on the inside.
0:08:18.240000 - 0:08:22.160000::But actually, it's like extremely highly technological lead, right?
0:08:22.960000 - 0:08:26.800000::And the andanaki sit in there and the eyes run back to the and minority reports,
0:08:26.800000 - 0:08:30.720000::style, it's inventing wheat in the air pool.
0:08:31.640000 - 0:08:32.280000::And it's beautiful.
0:08:32.280000 - 0:08:35.640000::And it's blue palm holds some seeds out to some hunter-gatherers.
0:08:35.680000 - 0:08:37.320000::And that says plant this in the earth.
0:08:37.720000 - 0:08:39.960000::And that's maybe the beginning of the agricultural.
0:08:40.160000 - 0:08:44.640000::But with the intention that like this should be there, like, why are you using this for bread?
0:08:44.640000 - 0:08:45.960000::Like this is for fucking beer.
0:08:48.640000 - 0:08:49.760000::Yeah, they probably came back.
0:08:49.760000 - 0:08:54.480000::They went away for a while and they're like, oh, when we come back, it's going to be like a gigantic fucking party.
0:08:54.480000 - 0:08:55::Uh-huh.

0:10:59.380000 - 0:11:06.740000::He says there's this strange correlation that none of the scientists want to admit but whenever there is an abduction
0:11:07.740000 - 0:11:09.340000::and
0:11:09.340000 - 0:11:15.140000::We have hundreds of accounts of this whenever there's an abduction when a Christian is
0:11:15.380000 - 0:11:22.860000::abducted and they invoke the name of Jesus Christ the abductors immediately vanish away and
0:11:23.340000 - 0:11:29.540000::None of the researchers want to admit this that there's a power to the name of Jesus Christ
0:11:33.700000 - 0:11:35.700000::You're getting fucking probed out

0:11:55.560000 - 0:12:02.920000::But then you peek through the bushes and suddenly you're still right next to the trail somehow you think you've gone far
0:12:03.200000 - 0:12:05.200000::But we're right there. Oh

0:13:19.080000 - 0:13:25.260000::It's nothing compared to how many little taverns were around in the late 1800s tenement style
0:13:25.840000 - 0:13:29.800000::people would have little like on one city block
0:13:29.800000 - 0:13:33.800000::There could be like ten little bars underneath people's houses little
0:13:34 - 0:13:36.840000::Taverns, okay, and these would be run by the
0:13:36.840000 - 0:13:45.720000::people that lived in the house and they would sell what they had and usually that was some ale
0:13:46.680000 - 0:13:51.640000::Okay, and they had bread and some cheese and some onions so those guys working on the damn Brooklyn bridge

0:14:23.480000 - 0:14:25.480000::The the most spoiled
0:14:26.120000 - 0:14:33.320000::Pickled in someone's mouth who had a sour mouth. Oh put the onions in that dude's mouth. They're gonna he's saliva pickles things so good

0:15:00 - 0:15:05.200000::attitude positive or negative because I'm so information based. I use
0:15:05.200000 - 0:15:10.480000::inflections to help human beings who are lower mental capacity understand what I'm
0:15:10.480000 - 0:15:16.800000::saying. But I'm basically a fucking English language calculator, T.I. calculator.
0:15:19.360000 - 0:15:24.960000::Well, to anybody, to any listeners that to anybody's still listening, if they can get
0:15:24.960000 - 0:15:30.080000::through this, this sort of horrible attitude that's perennial. If you're interested in the
0:15:30.080000 - 0:15:34.240000::plowman's lunch, you can go to McSorley's ale house, one of the oldest bars in New York. They

0:16:01.160000 - 0:16:08.040000::lunches on accident. I think Nate and I have a good number of text pictures to each other.
0:16:08.040000 - 0:16:13.320000::What do you have for lunch today, man? Oh, I just put a raw head of broccoli in a bowl, a raw
0:16:13.320000 - 0:16:20.200000::head of cauliflower in a bowl. And then, you know, maybe you guys are eating delicious on it.

0:16:33.160000 - 0:16:40.040000::Well, was it I was full off of it. It was just well, it was a two-parter. Okay, so I was
0:16:40.040000 - 0:16:50.520000::cooking something in the oven. Okay. And it was frankly, I would say like like five chicken
0:16:50.520000 - 0:16:58.600000::breasts or chicken tenderloins. Okay. Okay. Season them up. It wasn't just chicken. Okay. And then

0:17:07.880000 - 0:17:13.640000::broccoli as well. But the first portion of the meal was just eating like a bowl of like two different
0:17:13.640000 - 0:17:19.880000::types of chicken. And it had like one piece of broccoli in it. And I was like, is it one non-breaded?
0:17:19.880000 - 0:17:25.560000::You saying? Yeah, yeah. One breaded. No, it was Nate. How'd you season it? Well, of course I did.

0:21:16.720000 - 0:21:18.960000::Beef short rib and panadas.
0:21:20.840000 - 0:21:22.360000::So, I know this.
0:21:22.360000 - 0:21:23.360000::I know this.
0:21:23.360000 - 0:21:24.200000::I know this.
0:21:24.200000 - 0:21:25.040000::Where?
0:21:26.240000 - 0:21:27.680000::Beef short ribs.
0:21:27.680000 - 0:21:31.080000::Okay, that tells me this is a,
0:21:31.080000 - 0:21:32.080000::this is a,
0:21:34.760000 - 0:21:35.600000::probably not India.
0:21:35.600000 - 0:21:36.840000::Of course, South America.
0:21:36.840000 - 0:21:37.680000::Of course.
0:21:37.680000 - 0:21:40.320000::What if it's Central America, dude?
0:21:40.320000 - 0:21:42.320000::Our Central America and South America.
0:21:42.320000 - 0:21:43.320000::One of the two.
0:21:43.320000 - 0:21:45.120000::Sudo America, Sudo America.
0:21:45.120000 - 0:21:46.120000::America.
0:21:47.120000 - 0:21:48.480000::Which one?
0:21:48.480000 - 0:21:50.080000::I would have to say,
0:21:50.080000 - 0:21:53.840000::that sounds like a Guatemalan meal to me personally.
0:21:53.840000 - 0:21:54.680000::That could be.
0:21:54.680000 - 0:21:56.160000::That's what's interesting about this answer.
0:21:56.160000 - 0:21:57.160000::It definitely could be.
0:21:57.160000 - 0:21:58.160000::But according to this,
0:21:58.160000 - 0:22:00.240000::se vu'er, se vu'er article.
0:22:03.200000 - 0:22:04.200000::Chile.
0:22:04.200000 - 0:22:05.040000::I knew it, guys.
0:22:05.040000 - 0:22:06::I was gonna say,
0:22:06 - 0:22:07.680000::I can't escape Chile.
0:22:07.680000 - 0:22:10.200000::Can we go to Chile, please?
0:22:10.200000 - 0:22:13::We can, but we better not surf down there.
0:22:13 - 0:22:14::Why?
0:22:14 - 0:22:17.960000::I have a bone to pick because the localism is awful.
0:22:17.960000 - 0:22:18.840000::Along the,
0:22:18.840000 - 0:22:21.880000::Chile has some of the biggest coastline in the world
0:22:21.880000 - 0:22:23.720000::and you're not gonna let people come and surf
0:22:23.760000 - 0:22:24.680000::with you.
0:22:24.680000 - 0:22:25.960000::Come on, man.
0:22:25.960000 - 0:22:26.800000::I'm tired of you.
0:22:26.800000 - 0:22:28.360000::I'm just asking it.
0:22:28.360000 - 0:22:29.680000::Local zombie man.
0:22:29.680000 - 0:22:31.120000::Yeah, if you're not from Santiago,
0:22:31.120000 - 0:22:32.640000::I don't wanna fucking hear it from you, bro.
0:22:32.640000 - 0:22:33.960000::Get the fuck out of here, man.
0:22:33.960000 - 0:22:35.440000::Ha, ha, ha.
0:22:35.440000 - 0:22:36.520000::Dude.
0:22:36.520000 - 0:22:39.480000::Doesn't it get cold as fuck at the tip?
0:22:39.480000 - 0:22:40.680000::At the bottom of South America?
0:22:40.680000 - 0:22:41.520000::Well, they go down to it.
0:22:41.520000 - 0:22:42.520000::I know your tip gets cold.
0:22:42.520000 - 0:22:43.520000::I know your tip gets cold.
0:22:43.520000 - 0:22:44.520000::I know your tip gets cold.
0:22:44.520000 - 0:22:45.280000::Ha, ha, ha.
0:22:45.280000 - 0:22:47.320000::Nate's got that 31 degree ice.
0:22:47.320000 - 0:22:48.320000::But isn't it cold, man?
0:22:48.320000 - 0:22:50.440000::Isn't it like freezing down there, right?
0:22:50.440000 - 0:22:52.560000::You know, if it, if it, if the world,
0:22:52.560000 - 0:22:55.600000::dude, it's right by, it's right by the South Pole.
0:22:55.600000 - 0:22:57.480000::Dude, yeah.
0:22:57.480000 - 0:23:00.920000::Eric, we know we never, you don't need to do that like that.
0:23:00.920000 - 0:23:01.760000::You don't.
0:23:01.760000 - 0:23:02.760000::I'm out.
0:23:02.760000 - 0:23:05.560000::No, no, no, Nate, Nate, Jesus Christ.
0:23:05.560000 - 0:23:07.200000::This is this shit I've been mourning on.
0:23:07.200000 - 0:23:08.520000::It's all about this whole time.
0:23:08.520000 - 0:23:09.360000::This is what happens.
0:23:09.360000 - 0:23:10.840000::This is a Logan Paul.
0:23:10.840000 - 0:23:12.200000::This sucks, man.
0:23:12.200000 - 0:23:15.040000::Well, I guess I'm the only one left.
0:23:16.040000 - 0:23:17.560000::Ha, ha, ha.
0:23:18.560000 - 0:23:19.520000::No, it does get cold.
0:23:19.520000 - 0:23:20.760000::That's a good instinct, Nate,
0:23:20.760000 - 0:23:22::because it does get cold down there.
0:23:22 - 0:23:23.360000::You're right about that.
0:23:23.360000 - 0:23:24.440000::Do you know what's shocking?
0:23:24.440000 - 0:23:25.640000::Amazing instincts.
0:23:25.640000 - 0:23:26.480000::What?
0:23:26.480000 - 0:23:30.960000::That you can go east to west just as much as you can go north to south.
0:23:30.960000 - 0:23:36.360000::So what I'm saying by that is imagine going from day, imagine going,
0:23:36.360000 - 0:23:41.760000::how long does it take to fly from New York to London?
0:23:41.760000 - 0:23:45.640000::Perhaps just a guess of a plane concorde,
0:23:45.640000 - 0:23:50.720000::Boeing 747-816-AX-X-0700 engine.
0:23:50.720000 - 0:23:52.320000::What?
0:23:52.320000 - 0:23:53.200000::How long?
0:23:53.200000 - 0:23:55.440000::From New York to a London town.
0:23:55.440000 - 0:23:57.320000::Yeah, that's about six hours.
0:23:57.320000 - 0:23:58.560000::Six hours?
0:23:58.560000 - 0:23:59.560000::Okay.
0:23:59.560000 - 0:24:06.520000::How long does it take to fly from New York to Santiago, Chile?
0:24:06.520000 - 0:24:08.480000::Oh, I would have to imagine.
0:24:08.480000 - 0:24:11.160000::Because there's almost the same vertical, right?
0:24:11.160000 - 0:24:12.600000::Vertically, you know what to say.
0:24:12.600000 - 0:24:15::Holy crap.
0:24:15 - 0:24:15.840000::Try this.
0:24:15.840000 - 0:24:17.280000::Holy crap.
0:24:17.280000 - 0:24:19.160000::12 probably.
0:24:19.160000 - 0:24:20.160000::I don't know.
0:24:20.160000 - 0:24:21.360000::I'd have to Google it.
0:24:21.360000 - 0:24:26.520000::Well, this makes me curious about the east and west poles which haven't been discovered yet.
0:24:26.520000 - 0:24:27.520000::The East Pole.
0:24:27.520000 - 0:24:35.960000::You have such a great one.
0:24:35.960000 - 0:24:38.480000::No one's found that shit yet.
0:24:38.480000 - 0:24:40.800000::Eric, you are a genius, man.
0:24:40.800000 - 0:24:44.960000::That might be actually the smartest thing I've ever heard anybody say in my life.
0:24:44.960000 - 0:24:48.640000::Well, now, because there is a polar pole, the east and west.
0:24:48.640000 - 0:24:49.640000::Mm-hmm.
0:24:49.640000 - 0:24:51.880000::Yes, of course there is.
0:24:51.880000 - 0:24:56.760000::Why do you think the earth is like this as well?
0:24:56.760000 - 0:25:00.040000::Because if there's only a north and a south pole, the earth will be like this.

0:25:00 - 0:25:04.320000::would have been strung out, stretched out to a novel shape.
0:25:04.320000 - 0:25:04.820000::Right.
0:25:04.820000 - 0:25:09::But it's a spherical one, which implies you would be like,
0:25:09.920000 - 0:25:12.080000::if you were a part of the flat earth community,
0:25:12.080000 - 0:25:15.680000::like they would, I feel like that's like Michael Jordan,
0:25:15.680000 - 0:25:18.200000::like joining the bulls, you know, like if you,
0:25:18.200000 - 0:25:21.720000::if you were to offer came in, I do think I could,
0:25:21.720000 - 0:25:22.960000::I don't know.
0:25:22.960000 - 0:25:24.360000::Yeah.
0:25:24.360000 - 0:25:25.360000::Flat earth.
0:25:25.360000 - 0:25:27.640000::It is flat is what's funny.
0:25:28.600000 - 0:25:32.480000::Well, surface certain surfaces are, yeah,
0:25:32.480000 - 0:25:35.360000::certain surfaces are, they are kind of right.
0:25:35.360000 - 0:25:38.480000::And, you know, every every every community has some
0:25:38.480000 - 0:25:40.400000::flat. Yeah, the earth is flat.
0:25:40.400000 - 0:25:43.600000::Sometimes, you know, the sidewalk that outside my crib,
0:25:43.600000 - 0:25:44.600000::very flat.
0:25:44.600000 - 0:25:47.400000::And area, flat.
0:25:47.400000 - 0:25:47.920000::Okay, ready.
0:25:47.920000 - 0:25:49.600000::This is the definition of flat.
0:25:50.840000 - 0:25:56.080000::Lying at full length or spread out upon the ground.
0:25:56.080000 - 0:25:58.720000::Is any of the earth not on the ground?
0:25:59.720000 - 0:26:01.280000::See what I'm saying?
0:26:01.280000 - 0:26:02.280000::Not the part of the earth.
0:26:02.280000 - 0:26:05::Well, is we know we spread out on the ground.
0:26:06.040000 - 0:26:08.800000::Okay, that, I didn't know if I googled the right word.
0:26:10.880000 - 0:26:13.920000::Whoa, it's not that easy to find the definition of a word.
0:26:14.480000 - 0:26:17.880000::Are you guys getting pissed by the Google AI thing that pops up?
0:26:17.880000 - 0:26:22.280000::It's pissing me back to the no more sponsored ads,
0:26:22.280000 - 0:26:23.440000::no more SEO.
0:26:23.440000 - 0:26:27.040000::No, bring me back to the OG fucking Google where I got a scroll
0:26:27.040000 - 0:26:29.520000::for seven pages to get to what I want to see.
0:26:29.520000 - 0:26:32.280000::Say I'm done with the, I'm done with the fucking AI.
0:26:32.280000 - 0:26:33.840000::But, come on up with it.
0:26:34.080000 - 0:26:37.240000::It's, no, I'm done too, Nate.
0:26:37.240000 - 0:26:37.960000::Unreal.
0:26:37.960000 - 0:26:39.520000::Isn't that what Google is?
0:26:40.120000 - 0:26:41.120000::That's my question.
0:26:41.120000 - 0:26:42.720000::Pearl onion, Bastilla.
0:26:43.880000 - 0:26:46.480000::Veal and Pearl onion, Bastilla.
0:26:47.200000 - 0:26:50.400000::That's going to be that's a, that's a, that's a,
0:26:50.520000 - 0:26:52.920000::that's a Spanish Spanish meal.
0:26:53.880000 - 0:26:54.560000::Bastilla.
0:26:55.200000 - 0:26:56.200000::No, France.
0:26:56.200000 - 0:26:56.960000::I don't even know.
0:26:57.120000 - 0:26:57.960000::Incorrect.
0:26:58.640000 - 0:27:01.200000::Oh, you, I hope I'm pronouncing it right.
0:27:02.040000 - 0:27:03.880000::Dude, it's an North African meat pie.
0:27:05.560000 - 0:27:06.360000::That's what we said.
0:27:07.040000 - 0:27:08.640000::Dude, it's an North African meat pie.
0:27:09 - 0:27:11.200000::Oh, the other country in North Africa.
0:27:11.800000 - 0:27:14.640000::It's just a, that's, that's what's fucked up about.
0:27:14.640000 - 0:27:16.520000::So they don't specify.
0:27:16.640000 - 0:27:17.160000::Interesting.
0:27:17.160000 - 0:27:17.880000::They do.
0:27:18.440000 - 0:27:18.840000::Yeah.
0:27:18.840000 - 0:27:24.440000::They're not acknowledging the regional and different cultures of the region of North Africa.
0:27:24.720000 - 0:27:30.320000::As far as I can tell, as my great grandfather lived in Morocco as a child.
0:27:30.360000 - 0:27:32.240000::I know that's why I started being friends with you.
0:27:32.240000 - 0:27:33.280000::Of course I realized that.
0:27:36.680000 - 0:27:38.200000::But, um, interest.
0:27:39.800000 - 0:27:43.680000::Oh, the other night, yo, I had some ragu at the restaurant.
0:27:43.920000 - 0:27:46.720000::You know, no, not the type that you guys think you know, not the,
0:27:47.320000 - 0:27:48.840000::not the supermarket ragu.
0:27:48.840000 - 0:27:49.600000::That's a brand.
0:27:49.640000 - 0:27:52.320000::I'm talking about a style of pasta sauce.
0:27:53.360000 - 0:27:56.840000::And in the ragu, I was veal tongue.
0:27:58.200000 - 0:27:58.880000::Okay.
0:28:00.080000 - 0:28:01.120000::And I get it.
0:28:01.160000 - 0:28:01.720000::I get it.
0:28:01.720000 - 0:28:02.800000::There's no distinction.
0:28:02.800000 - 0:28:07.560000::There should be no distinction between the, we're all eating the inside of an animal.
0:28:08.040000 - 0:28:10.840000::But do we got to eat the baby cows tongue like that?
0:28:11.960000 - 0:28:12.720000::Did it taste good?
0:28:12.720000 - 0:28:13.160000::Yeah.
0:28:13.400000 - 0:28:16.640000::Did it, let me think twice when I felt a smooth little
0:28:16.640000 - 0:28:20.680000::piece of it because you're making out with that thing technically for one second.
0:28:21.280000 - 0:28:21.680000::Yeah.
0:28:21.680000 - 0:28:23.640000::Sort of the intramuscular makeup.
0:28:24.200000 - 0:28:24.400000::Yeah.
0:28:24.400000 - 0:28:25.600000::The final French kiss.
0:28:29.480000 - 0:28:32.840000::God, the, dude, the meat industry needs to be reckoned with.
0:28:32.840000 - 0:28:34.960000::That's just a no question thing.

0:37:38.300000 - 0:37:42.620000::Then you pile down them then they'd jump down in the garlic because the force of the head being crushed

0:42:33.760000 - 0:42:37.440000::hard to know what you said you froze, but I trust that it was quite interesting. Yeah, action,
0:42:37.440000 - 0:42:44.160000::Bronzen. Yeah, we might be coming for your crown, man. I'll just say should I get Tattie,

0:42:56.080000 - 0:43:02::Someone saw my dang tattoo on my ankle. He was like, what does that mean? And I was like, I just
0:43:02 - 0:43:07.520000::want this off my body. I hate that it just says it's the worst tattoo you can imagine. The word
0:43:07.520000 - 0:43:12.560000::you can make it say you could make it say bang bus pretty simply with a little bit of a line on
0:43:12.560000 - 0:43:25.280000::the D and then just draw a bus maybe. I can't believe you guys don't have any tats. That's so
0:43:25.280000 - 0:43:30.800000::like it's not usually who I line myself with. You know, well, when you do operations,
0:43:30.800000 - 0:43:39.680000::add it out when you do operation full back music note symbol. A full back treble cliff.
0:43:44.800000 - 0:43:50.240000::A full sleeve. That's great. Like in base, base and treble. And I'm saving room for how much
0:43:50.240000 - 0:43:54.800000::I love music. You think I'm gonna just get one for free. Start advertising some concept for free.
0:43:54.800000 - 0:44:00.320000::Hell no. Give me 10 racks. I'll take a look at the offer, but yeah.
0:44:00.800000 - 0:44:04.800000::The corporation should offer that get 20% off of the rest of your life if you

0:44:57.200000 - 0:44:59.440000::that anymore. I was just saying it to because

0:45:00 - 0:45:02.760000::I do think it's a cool mental exercise.
0:45:02.760000 - 0:45:03.440000::Oh, I'm up here.
0:45:03.440000 - 0:45:04.640000::I'm going to get to see the view.
0:45:04.640000 - 0:45:05.480000::Nope.
0:45:05.480000 - 0:45:06.320000::You just help.
0:45:06.320000 - 0:45:07.120000::No, the view is internal.
0:45:07.120000 - 0:45:08.480000::The views in your body.
0:45:08.480000 - 0:45:09.640000::That's right.
0:45:09.640000 - 0:45:10.480000::That's it.
0:45:14.840000 - 0:45:17.120000::Yeah, I'm hungry now that we think of how lunch lunch is going.
0:45:17.120000 - 0:45:18.840000::Lunch part two is going crazy.
0:45:18.840000 - 0:45:20.320000::People have been disrespecting lunch.
0:45:20.320000 - 0:45:22.040000::I think a lot lately with this whole,
0:45:22.040000 - 0:45:27.120000::an investing thing, which by the way, was a scam all along.
0:45:27.120000 - 0:45:29.080000::But people are having breakfast.
0:45:29.080000 - 0:45:33.400000::You know, people who skip breakfast, you're not really
0:45:33.400000 - 0:45:36.200000::understanding what lunch means, man.
0:45:36.200000 - 0:45:39.320000::You have to have already had breakfast for lunch.
0:45:39.320000 - 0:45:40.880000::This is an appetizer.
0:45:40.880000 - 0:45:42.600000::Should I have some yogurt?
0:45:42.600000 - 0:45:44.120000::Should I have some yogurt for breakfast?
0:45:44.120000 - 0:45:46.280000::And then, I mean, what the hell do I,
0:45:46.280000 - 0:45:47.560000::I have the whole day off.
0:45:47.560000 - 0:45:50.360000::It's Saturday.
0:45:50.360000 - 0:45:52.800000::What should I go have for lunch?
0:45:52.800000 - 0:45:53.320000::Right.
0:45:53.320000 - 0:45:54.120000::The hell should I have for lunch?
0:45:54.120000 - 0:45:55.240000::Great question.
0:45:55.240000 - 0:45:57.040000::Should we all have to have for lunch?
0:45:57.040000 - 0:45:59.920000::Wow.
0:45:59.920000 - 0:46:03.320000::I think I should go healthy with it, unfortunately.
0:46:03.320000 - 0:46:05.240000::There's that great bowl at friends and family.
0:46:05.240000 - 0:46:06.400000::Have you had that, Nate?
0:46:06.400000 - 0:46:10.560000::It's called like the powerful bowl.
0:46:10.560000 - 0:46:15.440000::No, it's got like edamame beans, beets, greens,
0:46:15.440000 - 0:46:17.080000::pulled chicken.
0:46:17.080000 - 0:46:19.080000::Oh.
0:46:19.080000 - 0:46:20.080000::Yeah.
0:46:20.080000 - 0:46:21.640000::Beets are very powerful.
0:46:21.640000 - 0:46:22.520000::Beets are very powerful.
0:46:22.520000 - 0:46:24.960000::And they turn your pee red.
0:46:24.960000 - 0:46:27.160000::And it's not blood.
0:46:27.160000 - 0:46:28.920000::I'm shocked every time.
0:46:28.920000 - 0:46:30.880000::I am so, every time I think it's fucking,
0:46:30.880000 - 0:46:34.560000::I'm basically waiting for that red pee to come out.
0:46:34.560000 - 0:46:36.200000::That's a, you're dead.
0:46:36.200000 - 0:46:40.240000::If you got a red, if you come out, if you piss blood,
0:46:40.240000 - 0:46:43.800000::if any sort of blood comes out of your pee, you're dead.
0:46:43.800000 - 0:46:49.560000::God, you just know that I don't want to get dark with it,
0:46:49.560000 - 0:46:54::but all three of us are going to have horrible medical discoveries
0:46:54 - 0:46:55::at some point.
0:46:55 - 0:46:58.600000::Where you're like, oh, fucking hell, there it is.
0:46:58.600000 - 0:47:01.240000::Been waiting for that area to pop out.
0:47:01.240000 - 0:47:02.240000::It's worth it.
0:47:02.240000 - 0:47:03.240000::Got it.
0:47:03.240000 - 0:47:04.240000::Got it.
0:47:04.240000 - 0:47:06.960000::But then you get to contribute to the research of it all.
0:47:06.960000 - 0:47:08.200000::You know what I'm saying?
0:47:08.200000 - 0:47:09.200000::Right.
0:47:09.200000 - 0:47:11.040000::Well, that's all you need to be so lucky.
0:47:11.040000 - 0:47:14.120000::You'd be so, by the way, you'd be so lucky to go out
0:47:14.120000 - 0:47:18.320000::in the hospital bed because a lot of people, they don't have
0:47:18.320000 - 0:47:19.840000::that chance.
0:47:20.560000 - 0:47:25.040000::Well, you know what they tell soldiers before they go
0:47:25.040000 - 0:47:28.920000::into battle sometimes, at least the highly motivational
0:47:28.920000 - 0:47:33.320000::sergeants and whatever lieutenants tell their, tell their team.
0:47:33.320000 - 0:47:34.160000::Do you know this?
0:47:34.160000 - 0:47:35.880000::This gives me great peace.
0:47:35.880000 - 0:47:37.960000::They say, could you put this to outside?
0:47:37.960000 - 0:47:40.160000::Yeah, they do say got your back, got your back, got your back.
0:47:40.160000 - 0:47:45.400000::But yeah, they do some little like,
0:47:45.400000 - 0:47:46.400000::fucking loosening.
0:47:46.400000 - 0:47:48.320000::I just want to imagine this.
0:47:48.320000 - 0:47:50::You're about to go out on the battlefield.
0:47:50 - 0:47:51.480000::You're sitting on 16 and 6.
0:47:51.480000 - 0:47:54.360000::I go up in a year and I go like this.
0:47:54.360000 - 0:48:00.960000::Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
0:48:00.960000 - 0:48:01.960000::Wow.
0:48:01.960000 - 0:48:04.160000::And like you said, silly team six.
0:48:04.160000 - 0:48:07.120000::We would be on silly team six.
0:48:07.120000 - 0:48:12.840000::No, but what they tell them is men, the bullet that is going
0:48:12.840000 - 0:48:17.280000::to kill you already has your name written on it.
0:48:17.280000 - 0:48:17.800000::OK.
0:48:17.800000 - 0:48:20.080000::Whatever that bullet is, however you're going to go out,
0:48:20.080000 - 0:48:21.480000::that's just how you're going out.
0:48:21.480000 - 0:48:26.200000::OK, not bullet, maybe yeah, physical bullet, silver bullet
0:48:26.200000 - 0:48:27.120000::for a vampire.
0:48:27.120000 - 0:48:31.600000::But for us, it could be fibromyla, myalgia, whatever.
0:48:31.600000 - 0:48:32.520000::You know what I mean?
0:48:32.520000 - 0:48:34::Sennesthesia.
0:48:34 - 0:48:35.800000::We're just anesthesia.
0:48:35.800000 - 0:48:36.320000::Right.
0:48:36.320000 - 0:48:38.080000::We're overwhelmed by a synesthesia experience.
0:48:38.080000 - 0:48:39.560000::And you jump up a bridge.
0:48:39.560000 - 0:48:43.480000::Whatever it is, it's just going to happen.
0:48:43.480000 - 0:48:47.440000::You know, and I just have to tell my soul that.
0:48:47.440000 - 0:48:50.160000::As a soldier, I'd be like, that's so interesting.
0:48:50.160000 - 0:48:52.520000::Because I looked at the bullets in my chamber.
0:48:52.520000 - 0:48:54.800000::And it says Sergeant Matheson, right on it.
0:48:54.800000 - 0:48:55.800000::Oh, Sergeant.
0:48:55.800000 - 0:48:58.560000::Oh, Sergeant.
0:48:58.560000 - 0:49:00.720000::Dude, that would get you fucking fired for the military,
0:49:00.720000 - 0:49:01.560000::though if you did that.
0:49:01.560000 - 0:49:02.560000::I would get me to go.
0:49:02.560000 - 0:49:03.560000::You could go AWOL.
0:49:03.560000 - 0:49:04.760000::You could go to the sergeant.
0:49:04.760000 - 0:49:06.160000::Maybe back in the Spartan days.
0:49:06.160000 - 0:49:06.760000::Yeah.
0:49:06.760000 - 0:49:07.600000::Course.
0:49:07.600000 - 0:49:09.760000::You spear them.
0:49:09.760000 - 0:49:12.480000::Speared them.
0:49:12.480000 - 0:49:14.080000::A long spear on the battlefield.
0:49:14.080000 - 0:49:15.080000::Wow.
0:49:15.080000 - 0:49:16.080000::Oh.
0:49:16.080000 - 0:49:18.280000::Remember, lunches my mind.
0:49:18.280000 - 0:49:21.320000::And they it's got the 40 foot spear.
0:49:21.320000 - 0:49:23::It's all wobbly.
0:49:23 - 0:49:24.240000::It's so wobbly.
0:49:24.240000 - 0:49:26.760000::Let me ask you guys about something.
0:49:26.760000 - 0:49:28.800000::Oh, Jack, take it away.
0:49:28.800000 - 0:49:30.400000::Take away your nails, bro.
0:49:30.400000 - 0:49:34.120000::I just, you're not supposed to see that.
0:49:34.120000 - 0:49:38.600000::If you are looking at the foot flat, Jack, take it away.
0:49:38.600000 - 0:49:40.480000::It's so disgusting, bro.
0:49:40.480000 - 0:49:41.600000::This is the pre-episode.
0:49:41.600000 - 0:49:42.440000::Take it off.
0:49:42.440000 - 0:49:44.320000::This is the fucking the feet finder.
0:49:44.320000 - 0:49:45.320000::We all are pretty, man.
0:49:45.320000 - 0:49:46.320000::I am.
0:49:46.320000 - 0:49:47.320000::I am pretty.
0:49:47.320000 - 0:49:52.040000::I hate reacting that way all emotionally when you show your toe, but it's just not.
0:49:52.040000 - 0:49:53.040000::We're not supposed to see that one.
0:49:53.040000 - 0:49:56.040000::You wouldn't last one shaking nails right now.
0:49:56.040000 - 0:49:57.040000::How can I nail it?
0:49:57.040000 - 0:49:58.040000::Look at trim.
0:49:58.040000 - 0:49:59.040000::Trim.

0:50:00 - 0:50:03.720000::How are you supposed to, you know, polished?
0:50:04.560000 - 0:50:11.400000::You need to be comfortable with raw, raw human life, man.
0:50:11.800000 - 0:50:13.400000::You can't be afraid of those things like that.
0:50:13.400000 - 0:50:15.600000::I won't do it again, but you're right.
0:50:15.600000 - 0:50:16::You're right.
0:50:16 - 0:50:17::We need to get you dirty.
0:50:17 - 0:50:18.880000::I want to get you covered in mud this summer.

0:50:42.400000 - 0:50:46.400000::And it just looked like the most relaxing thing I've ever fucking seen in my life.
0:50:46.880000 - 0:50:47.200000::Okay.
0:50:48.280000 - 0:50:55.040000::So us as a trio before I pass away or at an early age, we are doing mud baths.

0:51:11.240000 - 0:51:14.360000::There's an endless stream of beer going into the tub.
0:51:14.360000 - 0:51:15.960000::You drink as much as disgusting.
0:51:17.480000 - 0:51:20.240000::That sounds, that sounds the downright disgusting.
0:51:21.960000 - 0:51:24.080000::Maybe your tub, a tub of beer.
0:51:24.240000 - 0:51:26.480000::Nate, hold on a second.
0:51:27.200000 - 0:51:28.440000::I want you to just think about.

0:51:30 - 0:51:31::How happy.
0:51:31.360000 - 0:51:36.520000::How happy Eric was talking about that and what you did to him because what you're
0:51:36.520000 - 0:51:39.680000::doing is you're teaching a dog because Eric is very influential.
0:51:40.200000 - 0:51:44.400000::So when you're when he does something excited and you smack him for it,
0:51:44.960000 - 0:51:48::I'm worried that he's going to develop a new pattern of behavior.
0:51:49.280000 - 0:51:50.760000::Rage like behavior.
0:51:51.240000 - 0:51:54.600000::Well, where he's afraid to share what makes it right now.
0:51:55.600000 - 0:51:56.520000::Right, right.
0:51:56.520000 - 0:51:57.600000::Well, yeah.

0:52:06.600000 - 0:52:09.240000::And that's a fact that you can't even imagine taking a bath.
0:52:09.240000 - 0:52:10.480000::I can't even bathing it.
0:52:11.040000 - 0:52:14.160000::What you guys have for lunch at school.
0:52:15.680000 - 0:52:18.880000::Oh, dude, dude, my lunch is sorry, mom.

0:52:22.920000 - 0:52:23.880000::How could you say that?
0:52:24.360000 - 0:52:27.040000::Because isn't almost I feel like it's default.
0:52:27.760000 - 0:52:31.560000::I feel like whatever my mom gave me every day.
0:52:31.560000 - 0:52:36.880000::I had one white bread with baloney and lettuce, soggy ass lettuce.
0:52:36.880000 - 0:52:39.520000::By the time I was eating it, maybe a little bit of mayonnaise.
0:52:39.520000 - 0:52:40.840000::I ate that every day.
0:52:41.280000 - 0:52:42.280000::No chips.
0:52:42.520000 - 0:52:43.360000::No banana.

0:53:41.680000 - 0:53:44.200000::It was absolutely disgusting.
0:53:45.200000 - 0:53:49.200000::I don't know how the fuck my body, the human body can survive that.
0:53:49.200000 - 0:53:56.200000::It's a testament to the strength of the organs of the youth.
0:53:56.200000 - 0:53:57.200000::I like that.
0:53:57.200000 - 0:54:01.200000::Well, they're really testing the limits of Michelle Obama kind of fixed all this shit.

1:01:16.480000 - 1:01:17.480000::I think they broke up, didn't they?
1:01:17.480000 - 1:01:21.080000::Are they back together?
1:01:21.080000 - 1:01:22.080000::That's okay.
1:01:22.080000 - 1:01:23.800000::I don't even know.
1:01:23.800000 - 1:01:27.400000::Jack, Jack.
1:01:27.400000 - 1:01:28.880000::You know what I'm going to ask you, man.
1:01:28.880000 - 1:01:29.880000::All right.
1:01:29.880000 - 1:01:34.480000::With regards to joy, I'm really struggling to pick which one I'm going to experience.
1:01:34.480000 - 1:01:36.720000::Oh, that's a good problem to have.
1:01:36.720000 - 1:01:37.720000::Yeah, I know.
1:01:37.720000 - 1:01:38.720000::That's what's so cool.
1:01:38.720000 - 1:01:41.760000::It's because on the one hand, I could do this, but let me just say this.
1:01:41.760000 - 1:01:44.600000::I saw Furiosa last night.
1:01:44.600000 - 1:01:46.800000::Did that movie give me joy?
1:01:46.800000 - 1:01:52.040000::No, it gave me deep boredom, frankly, because the violence that they're showing doesn't
1:01:52.040000 - 1:01:55.920000::compare to the shit that I Google every single day.
1:01:55.920000 - 1:01:58.320000::But what gave did give me joy about this experience was gone.
1:01:58.320000 - 1:02:02.600000::Oh, man, that regal cinema over on Essex or whatever.
1:02:02.600000 - 1:02:03.600000::Mm.
1:02:03.600000 - 1:02:06.680000::It's a completely empty and Manhattan.
1:02:06.680000 - 1:02:08.680000::It's a completely Friday night.
1:02:08.680000 - 1:02:10.080000::There's not a soul in the theater.
1:02:10.080000 - 1:02:11.680000::We're leaning all the way back.
1:02:11.680000 - 1:02:12.680000::Oh, God.
1:02:12.680000 - 1:02:13.680000::That's not good.
1:02:13.680000 - 1:02:17.520000::You go down to the Essex market beforehand and you get a big plate.
1:02:17.520000 - 1:02:20.720000::The biggest plate I could find of chicken and rice, chicken over rice.
1:02:21.240000 - 1:02:22.440000::We're not up in the theater.
1:02:22.440000 - 1:02:23.440000::She.
1:02:23.440000 - 1:02:24.440000::Yeah.
1:02:24.440000 - 1:02:26.040000::Oh, that was fucking good.
1:02:26.040000 - 1:02:29.600000::We had an Omaha say night in the brightest under the brightest,
1:02:29.600000 - 1:02:33.240000::kind of office style lighting I have ever seen in my life.
1:02:33.240000 - 1:02:34.240000::But delicious food.
1:02:34.240000 - 1:02:35.240000::That was fun.
1:02:35.240000 - 1:02:36.240000::I can't imagine.
1:02:36.240000 - 1:02:38.240000::I remember these nights.
1:02:38.240000 - 1:02:44.320000::So amazing how the Essex regal eating chicken over rice in the movie theater made me feel
1:02:44.320000 - 1:02:45.320000::like.
1:02:45.320000 - 1:02:46.320000::Delish.
1:02:46.680000 - 1:02:52.680000::Guys, can I describe something that happened to me recently just in terms of food in movie
1:02:52.680000 - 1:02:53.680000::theaters?
1:02:53.680000 - 1:02:54.680000::Yes.
1:02:54.680000 - 1:02:58.600000::I think people would find interesting and it does have to, and it does pertain to lunch
1:02:58.600000 - 1:03:00.280000::in no sense.
1:03:00.280000 - 1:03:03.360000::Yeah, yeah, go ahead.
1:03:03.360000 - 1:03:06.760000::Eric, Eric wants to leave so badly.
1:03:06.760000 - 1:03:09.840000::No, no, I really don't.
1:03:09.840000 - 1:03:16.360000::So I just saw a movie and I snuck a full Chipotle meal into the theater.
1:03:16.360000 - 1:03:17.360000::OK.
1:03:17.360000 - 1:03:18.360000::Wow.
1:03:18.360000 - 1:03:20.680000::And it was pretty much an empty movie.
1:03:20.680000 - 1:03:22.760000::I saw the movie run, low, low run.
1:03:22.760000 - 1:03:24.360000::Oh, it's so good.
1:03:24.360000 - 1:03:25.360000::Great.
1:03:25.360000 - 1:03:26.360000::And I snuck.
1:03:26.360000 - 1:03:27.360000::Yeah.
1:03:27.360000 - 1:03:31.560000::And I snuck a, that movie's like watching like a fucking lit commercial.
1:03:31.560000 - 1:03:32.760000::Like, I don't know.
1:03:32.760000 - 1:03:34.360000::The legit is like.
1:03:34.360000 - 1:03:37.320000::It was fucking sick.
1:03:38.320000 - 1:03:47.520000::The, I snuck a case idea, like meal, and it was, and it's so, I was like, I'm very against
1:03:47.520000 - 1:03:51.360000::getting like pop, basically eating dinner in a movie theater.
1:03:51.360000 - 1:03:57.040000::That's just, I just don't do that because that, because the meals at these places are so,
1:03:57.040000 - 1:03:58.600000::I'm not eating popcorn for dinner.
1:03:58.600000 - 1:03:59.600000::All right.
1:03:59.600000 - 1:04:00.600000::I'm sorry.
1:04:00.600000 - 1:04:01.600000::Popcorn is delicious.
1:04:01.600000 - 1:04:02.600000::I'm just not doing it.
1:04:02.600000 - 1:04:05.400000::So what I am going to eat is fucking Chipotle for dinner.
1:04:05.400000 - 1:04:07.800000::And I'm going to bring that shit into the theater.
1:04:07.800000 - 1:04:10.040000::There was nobody, I'm not going to pack theater.
1:04:10.040000 - 1:04:11.040000::OK.
1:04:11.040000 - 1:04:12.720000::I'll only do this if there's like nobody.
1:04:12.720000 - 1:04:15.600000::So there are not too many people in there.
1:04:15.600000 - 1:04:18.080000::And my, it's so dark.
1:04:18.080000 - 1:04:22.240000::The sour cream that I got on the side was like flooding into the whole thing.
1:04:22.240000 - 1:04:24::It's dripping everywhere.
1:04:24 - 1:04:27.960000::It was, it was the most, it was disgusting.
1:04:27.960000 - 1:04:34.440000::It was really, really a tough, it was a tough meal to eat in terms of mess.
1:04:34.440000 - 1:04:38.120000::It was so messy, but you got to do what you got to do.
1:04:38.120000 - 1:04:40.800000::And that was just, that just reminded me of that.
1:04:40.800000 - 1:04:45.840000::And quite quickly, well, we're real quickly, quite quickly.
1:04:45.840000 - 1:04:50.440000::It's sad that sneaking things into theaters doesn't really exist anymore, man.
1:04:50.440000 - 1:04:52.360000::Because the movie theaters are basically begging you.
1:04:52.360000 - 1:04:55.120000::They're saying you can do whatever you want to us, bringing in any food.
1:04:55.120000 - 1:04:56.120000::Just come in.
1:04:56.120000 - 1:04:59.720000::Watch your own, we're really bringing a laptop, smoke, just come in.
1:04:59.720000 - 1:05:00.040000::Please.

1:05:00 - 1:05:06::man, you can't get a thrill. There's no thrill. We do. We need better movies. It's not the audience's fault.
1:05:06 - 1:05:13.360000::We need better ass movies. Give new filmmakers a chance, Hollywood. Let the new generation in and let our
1:05:13.360000 - 1:05:22.640000::voices be heard in film in a filmic sense. The DSL, our generation. Yeah, right. Okay, but my joy last
1:05:22.640000 - 1:05:28.320000::night did Kate, Burlant show at the Largo. Never performed there before, but I've always seen all those
1:05:28.320000 - 1:05:34.080000::pictures in that hallway. And so I was like, oh, finally. And it was just so fun because the audience,
1:05:34.080000 - 1:05:39.040000::I looked out in the audience and I was like, this is not, wouldn't, wouldn't be what the typical
1:05:39.040000 - 1:05:43.280000::joy tactics audience looks like. You know, I'm saying it was much, a lot of older people,
1:05:45.200000 - 1:05:50.480000::it was an interesting audience, but they were very careful in general. Very careful. What?
1:05:51.040000 - 1:05:55.360000::When you're speaking upon qualities of the joy tactics audience, that's all I'm gonna say. I'm sorry.
1:05:55.360000 - 1:06:00.080000::Well, so maybe there's a hidden older population that I don't know about, but just it was a grave
1:06:00.080000 - 1:06:07.360000::vibe. And I was like, this is awesome. So it was a fun time. That's what gave me joy. If you were
1:06:07.360000 - 1:06:13.200000::curious, pretty good. Incredible. So there you have it. That's a lot to start to.
1:06:13.200000 - 1:06:20::To part two, we dug in a little bit deeper into the topic of lunch. I had a really sour and bad
1:06:20 - 1:06:25.920000::attitude and I'm sorry for it. And I'd like to apologize officially for that. And I know that next
1:06:25.920000 - 1:06:31.280000::time when I come into this podcast, I'm gonna have a bright and shining smile on my face. And I've
1:06:31.280000 - 1:06:36.240000::been coming in with the most positive energy that you can imagine. It's gonna be shocking in a way
1:06:36.240000 - 1:06:41.760000::that you're gonna miss this version of me where I was kind of sour and bad. Because you guys
1:06:41.760000 - 1:06:46.320000::seem like a bad one when people are a little bit bad, the bad boy. They actually might like it when
1:06:46.320000 - 1:06:51.600000::you're like that. And really quick, I need to clarify. Kate's audience wasn't just older folks.
1:06:51.600000 - 1:06:56.640000::It was a full diverse age mix, but there were older people there and very young people there,
1:06:56.640000 - 1:07:03.920000::babies as well. So I'm sick of ages of spectrum. I'm fucking sick of it too. That's next month's theme
1:07:03.920000 - 1:07:12.080000::is addressing the elderly crisis. So comment what you had for lunch today. Comment what you just
1:07:12.080000 - 1:07:19.840000::said else. Let us know what you have for lunch. Lie about it and see you next time. And peace out, y'all.
