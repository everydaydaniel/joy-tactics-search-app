0:01:56.840000 - 0:01:58.640000::Basically, there would be a,
0:01:58.640000 - 0:02:00.240000::we'll like reenact what a scene would be like.
0:02:00.240000 - 0:02:05.080000::Yeah, so be like, Dad, say fucking, I didn't say,
0:02:05.080000 - 0:02:06.080000::they wouldn't say fuck.
0:02:06.080000 - 0:02:08.120000::Dad, they stunk.
0:02:09.120000 - 0:02:10.120000::Hey, Danny.
0:02:11.480000 - 0:02:12.480000::Uh-huh.
0:02:12.480000 - 0:02:13.480000::Yeah.
0:02:15.480000 - 0:02:17.960000::I mean, some of them were busted and I didn't have that.
0:02:17.960000 - 0:02:20.600000::I'm sorry, tell me, but it was compelling.
0:02:20.600000 - 0:02:22.720000::It would be like a girl dies in a car.
0:02:22.720000 - 0:02:24.680000::Like, it would always be somebody dies or something.
0:02:24.680000 - 0:02:27.600000::And the reason would be because she had premarital sex.
0:02:27.600000 - 0:02:30.200000::So she smoked a cigarette or something like that.
0:02:30.200000 - 0:02:33.360000::And then at the end of the day, the kids would come to the day and be like,
0:02:33.360000 - 0:02:34.360000::they fuck it.
0:02:34.360000 - 0:02:35.880000::Today, 400 people died.
0:02:35.880000 - 0:02:37.360000::And then they got giant wave killed them.
0:02:37.360000 - 0:02:39.560000::And then their dad would be like, well, it says in the Bible,
0:02:39.560000 - 0:02:41.200000::man, sometimes that happens.
0:02:41.200000 - 0:02:42.320000::And that would be the entire episode.
0:02:42.320000 - 0:02:43.320000::Right.
0:02:43.320000 - 0:02:44.320000::God never speaks.
0:02:44.320000 - 0:02:46.440000::It always comes through the parental figures.
0:02:46.440000 - 0:02:48.800000::Did you guys ever go to a Hell House?
0:02:48.800000 - 0:02:49.640000::Did you ever have that?
0:02:49.640000 - 0:02:50.640000::I lived in a house.
0:02:50.640000 - 0:02:51.640000::I never went to it.

0:02:55.360000 - 0:02:56.640000::Oh my God.
0:02:56.640000 - 0:02:57.480000::Okay.
0:02:57.480000 - 0:03:01.040000::Hell House is like during kind of Halloween time.
0:03:01.040000 - 0:03:02.280000::My church put this together.
0:03:02.280000 - 0:03:05.200000::It's like almost an interactive.
0:03:05.200000 - 0:03:08.720000::I don't even know how to describe it.
0:03:08.720000 - 0:03:09.720000::Hell.
0:03:09.720000 - 0:03:10.720000::It's like they do.
0:03:10.720000 - 0:03:13.800000::Yeah, they kind of reenact like what hell is like.
0:03:13.800000 - 0:03:15.120000::And there's like different station.
0:03:15.120000 - 0:03:16.960000::There's like demons walking around.
0:03:16.960000 - 0:03:20.560000::And then there's like a station where there's like a car that somebody drunk drove in.
0:03:20.560000 - 0:03:26.200000::It has all these like, like, oh, if you have premarital sex, like this will happen to
0:03:26.200000 - 0:03:27.200000::you.
0:03:27.200000 - 0:03:28.800000::There's like a STD fucking station.
0:03:28.800000 - 0:03:29.800000::I said, he wants to.
0:03:29.800000 - 0:03:30.800000::Yeah.

0:03:31.800000 - 0:03:32.800000::I thought it was going to be like the kitchen.
0:03:32.800000 - 0:03:33.800000::This is all they did.
0:03:33.800000 - 0:03:34.800000::They they made the room.
0:03:34.800000 - 0:03:38.200000::The chair, the room mates are fucking on my couch.
0:03:38.200000 - 0:03:40.320000::Everybody does have their own definition of hell.
0:03:40.320000 - 0:03:41.320000::That's true.
0:03:41.320000 - 0:03:42.480000::What's your definition of hell?
0:03:42.480000 - 0:03:46.040000::My definition of hell is losing on my followers.
0:03:46.040000 - 0:03:47.040000::What else?
0:03:47.040000 - 0:03:50.120000::No, I can't think of much else.
0:03:50.120000 - 0:03:51.840000::Running out of serial ideas.

0:05:46.960000 - 0:05:50.880000::I've learned to respect that one, Jack says it because if you cross that boundary, it gets
0:05:50.880000 - 0:05:51.880000::all violent.
0:05:51.880000 - 0:05:55.920000::Do you think that you have a really dark mind that probably just you just don't want to
0:05:55.920000 - 0:05:57.160000::let that spill out?
0:05:57.160000 - 0:05:58.160000::Not publicly.

0:06:04.200000 - 0:06:09.560000::Uh, and I regret a lot of what I've done in the past, but it's not something I'd like
0:06:09.560000 - 0:06:10.800000::to bring up on the podcast.
0:06:10.800000 - 0:06:15.760000::What's your biggest regret in your entire life?
0:06:15.760000 - 0:06:24.400000::Probably throwing away somebody's sandwich because I was mad at them.
0:06:24.400000 - 0:06:25.600000::That's that's sharing that.
0:06:25.600000 - 0:06:27.520000::I'm just fucking glad that really is.
0:06:27.520000 - 0:06:29.280000::Appreciate that.
0:06:29.280000 - 0:06:35.320000::This is, do you feel like we bring a vulnerability as a trio that you're not used to?
0:06:35.320000 - 0:06:36.320000::I think so.
0:06:36.320000 - 0:06:42.780000::I think podcast so much of podcasting is building up these facades and you guys kind of just
0:06:42.780000 - 0:06:44.680000::throw those up one day away.
0:06:44.680000 - 0:06:49.760000::Like I usually try to hide how stupid I am and how like kind of worthless I am, how bad
0:06:49.760000 - 0:06:52.360000::my stories are and you guys we put it right out there.
0:06:52.360000 - 0:06:53.360000::All that.
0:06:53.360000 - 0:06:54.360000::Yeah.
0:06:54.360000 - 0:06:55.360000::Yeah.
0:06:55.360000 - 0:06:56.360000::So sorry.
0:06:56.360000 - 0:06:57.360000::No, no.
0:06:57.360000 - 0:06:59.360000::You know what's funny when you try to hide something right?
0:06:59.360000 - 0:07:00.360000::What is that?
0:07:00.360000 - 0:07:03.600000::Let's say that there was a blanket over this entire table.
0:07:03.600000 - 0:07:05.840000::I can a picture right now.
0:07:05.840000 - 0:07:13.240000::So if you were trying to hide that thing with the blanket, what's funny is don't I?
0:07:13.240000 - 0:07:17.520000::What's funny is that's the only thing you would notice is that something's popping
0:07:17.520000 - 0:07:18.520000::out.
0:07:18.520000 - 0:07:25.080000::Even if it was a beautiful Pendleton wool American made blanket, you could still see that
0:07:25.080000 - 0:07:26.080000::thing underneath.
0:07:26.080000 - 0:07:27.840000::It doesn't matter how expensive and nice the blanket is.
0:07:27.840000 - 0:07:29.320000::How much money you spend on the blanket.
0:07:29.320000 - 0:07:30.320000::Right.
0:07:30.320000 - 0:07:31.320000::Let's try.
0:07:31.320000 - 0:07:32.320000::It will hold true.
0:07:32.320000 - 0:07:35.240000::Well, and that's what I like about us is like we lay our wrist bear.
0:07:35.240000 - 0:07:36.320000::We say, hello world.
0:07:36.320000 - 0:07:37.320000::This is us.
0:07:37.320000 - 0:07:38.320000::Take it or leave it.
0:07:38.320000 - 0:07:39.320000::Slice me open.
0:07:39.320000 - 0:07:40.320000::Slice me open.
0:07:40.320000 - 0:07:41.320000::Take a look.
0:07:41.320000 - 0:07:42.320000::Suck on that blood.
0:07:42.320000 - 0:07:43.320000::What?
0:07:43.320000 - 0:07:44.320000::Get a taste.
0:07:44.320000 - 0:07:45.320000::You'll taste it.
0:07:45.320000 - 0:07:46.320000::It's pure.
0:07:46.320000 - 0:07:47.320000::You'll taste that.
0:07:47.320000 - 0:07:48.320000::There are imperfections.
0:07:48.320000 - 0:07:51.120000::You guys did a whole episode about being fired.
0:07:51.120000 - 0:07:53.120000::And that is that is very.
0:07:53.120000 - 0:07:57.520000::I like throwing the headphones down.
0:07:57.520000 - 0:08:03.040000::That is very much a, I mean, that's the kind of you guys are almost investigating, investigative
0:08:03.040000 - 0:08:04.920000::reporters about your own lives.
0:08:04.920000 - 0:08:08.320000::We're investigative reporting grief and deep pain.
0:08:08.320000 - 0:08:12.040000::Well, the thing is we're still trying to discover who we are because that's a never ending
0:08:12.040000 - 0:08:15.240000::process, you know, right?
0:08:15.240000 - 0:08:16.240000::Right.
0:08:16.240000 - 0:08:21.040000::Because of changing, you're always trying to discover who you are.
0:08:21.040000 - 0:08:22.040000::It's wonderful.
0:08:22.040000 - 0:08:26.040000::It's like living in the olden days where we always we lived.
0:08:26.040000 - 0:08:27.520000::No, no, no.
0:08:27.520000 - 0:08:29.400000::And we would, uh, I got excited.
0:08:29.400000 - 0:08:30.400000::Okay.
0:08:30.400000 - 0:08:31.400000::Oh, okay.
0:08:31.400000 - 0:08:32.400000::Never mind.
0:08:32.400000 - 0:08:35.440000::And we, you know, they were discovering the Wild West Harrison Keller or whatever.
0:08:35.440000 - 0:08:36.440000::Harrison Keller.
0:08:36.440000 - 0:08:37.440000::Harrison Keller.
0:08:37.440000 - 0:08:38.440000::Oh, yeah.
0:08:38.440000 - 0:08:39.440000::Harrison Keller.
0:08:39.440000 - 0:08:40.440000::You were trying to say, Lucy.
0:08:40.440000 - 0:08:41.440000::Did you make it?
0:08:41.440000 - 0:08:42.440000::Did you blame Lucy Clark and Helen Kelly?
0:08:42.440000 - 0:08:43.440000::And Harrison Keller.
0:08:43.440000 - 0:08:44.440000::You just blame them all.
0:08:44.440000 - 0:08:45.440000::Oh, they all bore me.
0:08:45.440000 - 0:08:46.440000::Let me get to the next.
0:08:46.440000 - 0:08:47.440000::Okay.
0:08:47.440000 - 0:08:57.440000::Let's try to make it a make it a make it a make it a voice because it's really hard.
0:08:57.440000 - 0:08:58.440000::Yeah.
0:08:58.440000 - 0:09:00.520000::This is when I'm juggling this many plates.
0:09:00.520000 - 0:09:04.960000::It's important that I get to the end of whatever that means.
0:09:04.960000 - 0:09:08.960000::Discovering yourself is like being Lewis and Clark and discovering Louisiana purchase.
0:09:09.960000 - 0:09:10.960000::Okay.
0:09:10.960000 - 0:09:11.960000::They discovered it.
0:09:11.960000 - 0:09:13.960000::They discovered it.
0:09:13.960000 - 0:09:19.280000::And the point is, imagine if you were discovering the Western fronts of America and America
0:09:19.280000 - 0:09:21.600000::was constantly growing and shifting.
0:09:21.600000 - 0:09:30.240000::And forever there was new valleys and new gold to unleash within the water of the, um,
0:09:30.240000 - 0:09:31.240000::Rockies.
0:09:31.240000 - 0:09:32.240000::Yeah.
0:09:32.240000 - 0:09:33.240000::Yeah.
0:09:33.240000 - 0:09:34.640000::Does that make that's all I wanted to say?
0:09:34.640000 - 0:09:35.640000::It does.
0:09:35.640000 - 0:09:37.840000::What if you were exploring?
0:09:37.840000 - 0:09:38.840000::Is that what you are saying?
0:09:38.840000 - 0:09:42.840000::No, I'm saying what if you went exploring and the land was constantly moving and shifting?
0:09:42.840000 - 0:09:43.840000::Oh.
0:09:43.840000 - 0:09:45.840000::And you're quitting that to constant self discovery.
0:09:45.840000 - 0:09:46.840000::Right.
0:09:46.840000 - 0:09:51.520000::You're saying there's valleys and there's grand canyons and there's silver lakes all within
0:09:51.520000 - 0:09:52.520000::every single one of us.
0:09:52.520000 - 0:09:53.520000::Yeah.
0:09:53.520000 - 0:09:54.520000::So silver lake and echo part.
0:09:54.520000 - 0:09:55.520000::Yeah.
0:09:55.520000 - 0:09:56.520000::A fair boundary.
0:09:56.520000 - 0:09:57.520000::A fair boundary.
0:09:57.520000 - 0:09:58.520000::A fair boundary.
0:09:58.520000 - 0:09:59.520000::Oh.
0:09:59.520000 - 0:10:00.520000::Oh.
0:10:00.520000 - 0:10:02.520000::I'll give it up for the group for the observatory.
0:10:02.520000 - 0:10:03.520000::Yeah.

0:10:00 - 0:10:04.300000::Yeah, give it a good. You guys talk about my Chicago. Yeah, my
0:10:04.300000 - 0:10:09.680000::stuff around you go up there. You run with those dogs every day. Wow. Yeah. That's
0:10:09.680000 - 0:10:13.460000::beautiful dog. Well, they got wild dogs and Griffith. I think they do.
0:10:13.460000 - 0:10:19.760000::I know you got to be coyotes. Oh, yeah. You remember your dog's and Nate. What's
0:10:19.760000 - 0:10:28.200000::that like? Chillin up at Griffith. You know that hiking with Kevin Neillem thing where he
0:10:28.200000 - 0:10:32.180000::walks around the park. Yeah. I see Nate in the background of every single one of
0:10:32.180000 - 0:10:38.540000::those. Just trying to stay in frame. Just barely. Just barely. Whenever they stop,
0:10:38.540000 - 0:10:43.820000::you kind of go by the bush. Yeah. That's where I saw David Spade talk about how he got
0:10:43.820000 - 0:10:49.940000::attacked and had to finch. Oh, yeah. Oh, no. Yeah. His assistant became obsessed with him
0:10:49.940000 - 0:10:54.700000::and tried to murder him. No way. Yeah. What? Why would you murder someone you're obsessed
0:10:54.700000 - 0:10:58.700000::with? Why would you be obsessed with David Spade? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
0:10:58.700000 - 0:11:05.460000::David Spade. We're listening. Fuck you. Do not. Do not. David Spade. If you're listening,
0:11:05.460000 - 0:11:12.100000::mm. I love the fuck emperor. Kuzko. What? Oh, yeah. I've changed my tone completely. I
0:11:12.100000 - 0:11:17.140000::can't really forget. I forgot to go to the show today. And I forgot that comedy. Shout out
0:11:17.140000 - 0:11:26.260000::to David Spade. I like the David of spades. Shout out to Caleb. Well, Caleb, for those
0:11:26.260000 - 0:11:34.100000::you who don't know, Caleb, Pits is a podcaster here and broken, uh, where I'm going to say
0:11:34.100000 - 0:11:43.440000::much. If I bring him much, Wick, you flirt with me. I know. I love you. What? Hello? Let's
0:11:43.440000 - 0:11:49.760000::hear some. All right. Let's keep it cool. Um, so you grew up in North Carolina. Yeah,
0:11:49.760000 - 0:11:57.920000::I did. And Boonsville. Well, me. Boonsville. Did you make up the most rural sounding town?
0:11:57.920000 - 0:12:02::No, that's a town. I think there's a town called Boon and there's a town called Greenville.
0:12:02 - 0:12:06::And you grew up in Boonsville, right? So you grew up in Wilmington. There's a big film scene
0:12:06 - 0:12:10.960000::there. There is big film. Some would say that Iron Man one and two were filmed there. Oh,
0:12:10.960000 - 0:12:16.160000::interesting. And some would also say that under the dome was filmed there. Dawson's Creek. And
0:12:16.160000 - 0:12:25.280000::that Dawson's Creek. Some other movie. Yeah, you just got to end to Sam too. And so
0:12:26 - 0:12:29.680000::when you're growing up, would you see, is that how you kind of got into the art as you see,
0:12:29.680000 - 0:12:37.840000::Robert Downey, Jr. flying overhead and his crazy ass Iron Man suit? No, no, I, but I did one
0:12:37.840000 - 0:12:44.080000::time my mom had to make a food delivery to Screen Jim Studios. And I went in and I saw
0:12:45.040000 - 0:12:49.600000::of set for some boxing movie that never got released. And I said, I have to, I'm going to be
0:12:49.600000 - 0:12:55.440000::involved with this when I get much older. I guess we should go into when did that bug first by
0:12:55.440000 - 0:13:01.920000::us that act like that entertainment. Oh, man. I actually don't know that story about you, Nate.
0:13:01.920000 - 0:13:06.160000::I'm trying to think like when it is. I feel you were born with the bug. I think I was. I think
0:13:06.160000 - 0:13:12.960000::I actually were. You were, you were that baby in the 1990s. Yeah, you are the bug. Yeah, I might,
0:13:12.960000 - 0:13:18.400000::I might be. I'm trying to think when did I get the fucking bug to be hilarious and entertain people?
0:13:18.400000 - 0:13:24.720000::I think it was honestly defense mechanism. 100% different. I didn't want to do this at all.
0:13:24.720000 - 0:13:29.600000::I want to be, I want to be like a fucking Dave Pilke or something. You know, who's that?
0:13:29.600000 - 0:13:35.440000::Is that author? The Captain Underpants author. Oh, Captain, oh my god. You wanted to do Flip Arama.
0:13:35.440000 - 0:13:39.520000::Yes. That's crazy. That was my first thing you thought of. I remember that.
0:13:41.200000 - 0:13:47.760000::Oh my god. It was. It was crashed. It was a little crazy. I love it. So you were a poop,
0:13:47.760000 - 0:13:53.520000::whatever, such a loser that you needed to make people laugh. Well, you guys know I had to
0:13:53.520000 - 0:14:00.080000::switch schools a lot as a kid. Why? So I was going to, this is sad. I was a lonely kid and I feel
0:14:00.080000 - 0:14:05.920000::like a little Nate is just makes people sad. Jack, we're all about. You're so boring.
0:14:07.120000 - 0:14:11.600000::You just fell asleep while giving you some incredible information about that. Jesus Christ.
0:14:11.600000 - 0:14:17.600000::I was sleeping. I cannot do with you. I wasn't sleeping. What was little Nate? Little Nate
0:14:17.600000 - 0:14:25.440000::with shy and lonely and had to change schools. Kindergarten went to a different school. First grade,
0:14:25.440000 - 0:14:29.680000::went to different school. Fourth grade, fifth grade. That sounds like you were the problem, maybe.
0:14:29.680000 - 0:14:33.840000::If you're going to know, I know I might have been. How many fucking schools were you living?
0:14:33.840000 - 0:14:40.400000::How many school are in your town? It was all for different reasons. Each one was like kind of a
0:14:40.400000 - 0:14:46.800000::coincidence. And all like, oh, we're switching to this school. So every year I had to fucking make new
0:14:46.800000 - 0:14:53.280000::friends. I had to be, hi, it's me, funny Nate. And I never want to do this. Yeah, that's how I made
0:14:53.280000 - 0:14:59.200000::friends. So you started out on expert mode. Right. So you had to re.

0:15:00 - 0:15:03.200000::Well, yeah, that's as far as I can go with that thought.
0:15:03.200000 - 0:15:05.400000::Sorry, there's a buzz saw going on.
0:15:05.400000 - 0:15:07::You actually can't hear it on here.
0:15:07 - 0:15:07.800000::Are you kidding me?
0:15:07.800000 - 0:15:08.800000::It's kind of just for us.
0:15:08.800000 - 0:15:09.800000::Holy smokes.
0:15:09.800000 - 0:15:10.800000::So there's some crazy constructions.
0:15:10.800000 - 0:15:13.200000::So we can make up sounds that are going on the background.
0:15:13.200000 - 0:15:14.800000::Can you see that?
0:15:14.800000 - 0:15:18.400000::Oh, we have video.
0:15:18.400000 - 0:15:21.200000::Has anyone's arms ever been this far onto the table?
0:15:21.200000 - 0:15:22.200000::My arms are not on the phone.
0:15:22.200000 - 0:15:26.600000::I think you're the tallest person we've had in here.
0:15:26.600000 - 0:15:30.400000::You know, and people talk about how bad this chair hurts.
0:15:30.400000 - 0:15:31.800000::Which chair do you have?
0:15:31.800000 - 0:15:33.800000::I had this like fucking metal coming out.
0:15:33.800000 - 0:15:35.800000::Yeah, that's a famously bad chair.
0:15:35.800000 - 0:15:36.800000::It hurts.
0:15:36.800000 - 0:15:40::I thought they took the bowl out yesterday, but I guess they dug
0:15:40 - 0:15:42::it even harder deeper into that.
0:15:42 - 0:15:43.800000::Deep deeper into that.
0:15:43.800000 - 0:15:47.400000::So I just want to say I know, I know we've kind of skipped
0:15:47.400000 - 0:15:51::at the end of Nate's head story of grown up, but I'm sorry for
0:15:51 - 0:15:52::what happened to you, man.
0:15:52 - 0:15:53::Thank you.
0:15:53 - 0:15:54::I'm actually just kidding.
0:15:54 - 0:15:55::Thank you, man.
0:15:55 - 0:15:57.600000::I built the man that I'm close friends with today.
0:15:57.600000 - 0:16:00::I think if you had amazing childhood and you were a jock,
0:16:00 - 0:16:02.800000::like we all wanted to be, I would hate your ass right now.
0:16:02.800000 - 0:16:05.200000::If you had that, I would be the worst person I fucking playing.
0:16:05.200000 - 0:16:08.600000::I think I probably knowing myself probably would have defended you
0:16:08.600000 - 0:16:09.600000::if you were a child.
0:16:09.600000 - 0:16:11.800000::If I was a teacher in that class, I would have defended the
0:16:11.800000 - 0:16:12.800000::fuck about every day.
0:16:12.800000 - 0:16:14.600000::I would defend your bag.
0:16:14.600000 - 0:16:15.600000::That's good.
0:16:15.600000 - 0:16:16.600000::Appreciate that.
0:16:16.600000 - 0:16:18.200000::Yeah, I would have jumped in front of all the insults and let
0:16:18.200000 - 0:16:19.200000::them just fall on.
0:16:19.200000 - 0:16:24.800000::Oh, when, uh, when the Virginia Tech massacre
0:16:24.800000 - 0:16:27::happened, the shooting, I remember that.
0:16:27 - 0:16:29.800000::Uh, I was in Virginia, obviously.
0:16:30.800000 - 0:16:34.600000::And the day after we went back to school, you said, obviously,
0:16:34.600000 - 0:16:36.600000::that kind of makes us how like you did.
0:16:38 - 0:16:38.600000::I was there.
0:16:38.600000 - 0:16:40::I was there.
0:16:40 - 0:16:42.800000::I was there, obviously, obviously.
0:16:42.800000 - 0:16:44.200000::What else would I get up to?
0:16:44.200000 - 0:16:45.200000::Clearly.
0:16:45.200000 - 0:16:50.600000::So my teacher and my English teacher almost had in fourth grade,
0:16:50.600000 - 0:16:52.600000::but I was a sophomore in high school.
0:16:53.600000 - 0:16:56.200000::They said to us just so they got really serious.
0:16:56.200000 - 0:16:59.400000::And they said, just so everybody knows, I would take a bullet
0:16:59.400000 - 0:17:01.200000::for each and every one of you.
0:17:02.800000 - 0:17:03.800000::Wow.
0:17:03.800000 - 0:17:04.800000::Oh my God.
0:17:04.800000 - 0:17:05.800000::I would not do that.
0:17:06.800000 - 0:17:10.200000::I saw a teacher get all cowardly one time at a bullet.
0:17:11.200000 - 0:17:12.200000::Yeah.
0:17:13.200000 - 0:17:17.400000::No, it was a earthquake was occurring in Seattle.
0:17:17.400000 - 0:17:19.400000::And you know, we get earthquakes on the West Coast.
0:17:20.400000 - 0:17:23::And we were making art for the new building.
0:17:23 - 0:17:26::We were like putting our hands in like a little bit of cement.
0:17:26.600000 - 0:17:28.600000::Or something, you know, and like painting them.
0:17:28.600000 - 0:17:30.600000::So you were interacting with the ground.
0:17:30.600000 - 0:17:31.600000::I wear the earth.
0:17:31.600000 - 0:17:34.600000::No, it was like the like art prod like lives, blacks.
0:17:34.600000 - 0:17:37.800000::And there's just one tall guy, Carl and our teacher, Mrs. Casper,
0:17:37.800000 - 0:17:38.800000::who I think had a,
0:17:39.800000 - 0:17:42.600000::some type of pill, pill problem, I think, because she's on the
0:17:42.600000 - 0:17:43.600000::big time.
0:17:43.600000 - 0:17:44.600000::Okay.
0:17:44.600000 - 0:17:47.400000::She started yelling at Carl, who was the tallest getting the
0:17:47.400000 - 0:17:49.200000::class. She said, Carl, stop knock them on the wall.
0:17:49.200000 - 0:17:50.400000::Stop doing whatever you're doing.
0:17:50.400000 - 0:17:51.600000::And he's like, I'm not doing anything.
0:17:52 - 0:17:53.200000::Then what's he daisy?
0:17:54.400000 - 0:17:57.200000::It was the heaviest earthquake I've ever felt.
0:17:57.200000 - 0:17:58.600000::And we all got under the table.
0:17:58.600000 - 0:18:02.200000::And she immediately started crying and praying so loud.
0:18:03.200000 - 0:18:05.200000::And she was like, God.
0:18:06.200000 - 0:18:09.400000::She really I could tell I wasn't afraid until I saw her.
0:18:09.400000 - 0:18:12.500000::And she was like shaking under the table, like holding these two
0:18:12.500000 - 0:18:13::girls hands.
0:18:13 - 0:18:16.400000::Like, what is the hardest way to react to an earthquake?
0:18:16.400000 - 0:18:18.200000::Like if you're like start shearing the ground.
0:18:20.400000 - 0:18:21.400000::Shaking the earth back.
0:18:21.400000 - 0:18:24::When he says he acted cowardly, I thought she was like trying to
0:18:24 - 0:18:25.800000::put kids between her and the ground.
0:18:25.800000 - 0:18:28::She's like standing on the softest case.
0:18:28 - 0:18:29.800000::He's anything but shaking.
0:18:29.800000 - 0:18:32.400000::Can you imagine if our earthquake happened, then somebody started
0:18:32.400000 - 0:18:33.400000::crumping on it?
0:18:33.400000 - 0:18:34.400000::Crumping.
0:18:34.400000 - 0:18:36.400000::Well, it would look like they're just standing still.
0:18:36.400000 - 0:18:39.400000::That was like going anti-tribal.
0:18:39.400000 - 0:18:40.400000::They're getting stabilized.
0:18:40.400000 - 0:18:41.400000::Yeah.
0:18:41.400000 - 0:18:42.400000::It would just be perfect.
0:18:42.400000 - 0:18:44.400000::They're kind of just staying in the exact same place.
0:18:44.400000 - 0:18:45.400000::That'd be so scary.
0:18:45.400000 - 0:18:46.400000::Good fucking music video idea.
0:18:46.400000 - 0:18:48.400000::I heard that we're crumping.
0:18:48.400000 - 0:18:50.400000::Oh, you don't want to talk to me about crumping.
0:18:50.400000 - 0:18:51.400000::Getting crump.
0:18:51.400000 - 0:18:52.400000::Crump it.
0:18:52.400000 - 0:18:53.400000::Turn down for what?
0:18:53.400000 - 0:18:54.400000::Everybody getting crunk.
0:18:54.400000 - 0:18:56.400000::Crunk and crumping.
0:18:56.400000 - 0:18:58.400000::We need to bring those words back.
0:18:58.400000 - 0:19:00.400000::I think crumping was after crunk.
0:19:00.400000 - 0:19:02.400000::I think crunk was like little junk.
0:19:02.400000 - 0:19:03.400000::Pre-crunk.
0:19:03.400000 - 0:19:04.400000::What about Irish crunk?
0:19:04.400000 - 0:19:05.400000::We're in a post crunk.
0:19:05.400000 - 0:19:06.400000::You Irish style.
0:19:06.400000 - 0:19:07.400000::Oh shit.
0:19:07.400000 - 0:19:08.400000::That's old.
0:19:08.400000 - 0:19:10.400000::How come that was says, is that a call?
0:19:10.400000 - 0:19:13.400000::Is there a documentary that's going to come out about the Irish river?
0:19:13.400000 - 0:19:16.400000::The kids that were doing that crazy.
0:19:16.400000 - 0:19:18.400000::I used to have some kids who went.
0:19:18.400000 - 0:19:28.400000::I had to take them to Irish river dancing and they were some,
0:19:28.400000 - 0:19:30.400000::man, these kids are some young mates.
0:19:30.400000 - 0:19:31.400000::I'll say that.
0:19:31.400000 - 0:19:32.400000::They were some dorks.
0:19:32.400000 - 0:19:36.400000::You just kind of shout out to all the dorks out there.
0:19:36.400000 - 0:19:37.400000::It gets better.
0:19:37.400000 - 0:19:38.400000::Are you making fun of them?
0:19:38.400000 - 0:19:39.400000::I'm not making fun of them.
0:19:39.400000 - 0:19:42.400000::It's just, you know, I was trying to steer them in the right
0:19:42.400000 - 0:19:45.400000::I love Chopin.
0:19:45.400000 - 0:19:47.400000::I love Chopin.
0:19:47.400000 - 0:19:49.400000::I want me to sing some.
0:19:49.400000 - 0:19:50.400000::Name one lyric.
0:19:50.400000 - 0:19:51.400000::Name one lyric.
0:19:51.400000 - 0:19:52.400000::Chopin's on, bitch.
0:19:52.400000 - 0:19:53.400000::Whoa.
0:19:53.400000 - 0:19:54.400000::He nailed it.
0:19:54.400000 - 0:19:59.400000::But yeah, it's because these kids are rich.

0:20:00 - 0:20:02.800000::I think if you're rich, you get into the wackest hobbies.
0:20:02.800000 - 0:20:03.800000::Right, right.
0:20:03.800000 - 0:20:04.640000::I never wrote.
0:20:04.640000 - 0:20:05.480000::I was voting.
0:20:05.480000 - 0:20:07.560000::I would love to have a boat so bad.
0:20:07.560000 - 0:20:08.400000::Oh my God.
0:20:08.400000 - 0:20:10.720000::You have been talking to, you've been boat obsessed recently.
0:20:10.720000 - 0:20:11.560000::I've been watching.
0:20:11.560000 - 0:20:13.400000::I can't, you won't shut up about fucking boats.
0:20:13.400000 - 0:20:14.800000::I showed Nate these videos last night.
0:20:14.800000 - 0:20:16.400000::I've been talking about these so much.
0:20:16.400000 - 0:20:18.400000::But if you've all seen these videos of these,
0:20:18.400000 - 0:20:20.800000::there's an inlet in Miami.
0:20:20.800000 - 0:20:21.640000::Oh yeah.
0:20:21.640000 - 0:20:22.920000::Where people are trying to get out of the inlet
0:20:22.920000 - 0:20:25.120000::and it's hella choppy and you see experienced boaters
0:20:25.120000 - 0:20:26.680000::going through the crazy waves.
0:20:26.680000 - 0:20:28.760000::And then you see the newbie boaters going through
0:20:28.760000 - 0:20:31.920000::the crazy waves and most of the newbies can't handle it.
0:20:31.920000 - 0:20:32.760000::Oh my God.
0:20:32.760000 - 0:20:33.760000::And it says the type of boat.
0:20:33.760000 - 0:20:36.800000::It's like, this is the Yamaha Scarab going through it
0:20:36.800000 - 0:20:39::on this type of day.
0:20:39 - 0:20:40::Wow.
0:20:40 - 0:20:40.840000::Anyways.
0:20:40.840000 - 0:20:41.840000::Wow.
0:20:41.840000 - 0:20:42.680000::That's crazy.
0:20:42.680000 - 0:20:44.600000::I'm going to focus so bad.
0:20:44.600000 - 0:20:46.680000::I feel myself wanting conservative.
0:20:46.680000 - 0:20:47.600000::Because of the lowly island.
0:20:47.600000 - 0:20:48.120000::You know what I mean?
0:20:48.120000 - 0:20:50.600000::Well, I think old guys definitely have it figured out.
0:20:50.600000 - 0:20:51.440000::Like at Palm Springs, I never thought.
0:20:51.440000 - 0:20:54.360000::There is nothing more fun than just like playing golf all day
0:20:54.360000 - 0:20:55.160000::and watching TV.
0:20:55.160000 - 0:20:56::Oh my God.
0:20:56 - 0:20:57::It's a big golfer.
0:20:57 - 0:20:58.320000::I love golfing.
0:20:58.400000 - 0:21:00.560000::I'm trying to get back into golf.
0:21:00.560000 - 0:21:04.200000::Like I used to golf and I still have my fucking swing.
0:21:04.200000 - 0:21:05.160000::I got it.
0:21:05.160000 - 0:21:06.360000::I never lost it.
0:21:06.360000 - 0:21:09.920000::You guys went to a golfing range and I was like, good God.
0:21:09.920000 - 0:21:11.520000::Am I like still?
0:21:11.520000 - 0:21:12.640000::I never was incredible.
0:21:12.640000 - 0:21:14.480000::I'm like, damn, I still got it.
0:21:14.480000 - 0:21:15.960000::Like I can reach the ball.
0:21:15.960000 - 0:21:16.720000::You're still hitting.
0:21:16.720000 - 0:21:19.320000::I'm still I have an incredible swing.
0:21:19.320000 - 0:21:20.640000::Like it never went away.
0:21:20.640000 - 0:21:21.640000::Oh my God.
0:21:21.640000 - 0:21:23.720000::Do you guys think we'll be friends forever?
0:21:23.720000 - 0:21:24.720000::No.
0:21:24.720000 - 0:21:28.240000::There will be a big falling out between all of us.
0:21:28.240000 - 0:21:29.560000::I think for different reasons.
0:21:29.560000 - 0:21:31.600000::I just imagined us all being old as hell.
0:21:31.600000 - 0:21:34::We're all, we all have this our own sitcom.
0:21:34 - 0:21:34.800000::It's the Caleb.
0:21:34.800000 - 0:21:35.480000::Wow.
0:21:35.480000 - 0:21:37.680000::Caleb, whatever show.
0:21:37.680000 - 0:21:38.680000::Doesn't know my last name.
0:21:41.560000 - 0:21:44.080000::Caleb, but whatever you do, ever.
0:21:44.080000 - 0:21:46.880000::I was trying to come up with a profession.
0:21:46.880000 - 0:21:48.320000::Oh, you would be Caleb.
0:21:48.320000 - 0:21:50.120000::Caleb Plummer, what are you talking about?
0:21:50.120000 - 0:21:51.320000::I never been in English.
0:21:51.320000 - 0:21:53.280000::I was like, who is the one?
0:21:53.280000 - 0:21:55.200000::What is the sitcom that is the guy's first name?
0:21:55.200000 - 0:21:56.320000::Caleb and John.
0:21:56.320000 - 0:21:58.320000::Caleb, who's that formula?
0:21:58.320000 - 0:21:59.680000::Oh, the two of the tool man.
0:21:59.680000 - 0:22:00.680000::Yeah, yeah.
0:22:00.680000 - 0:22:02.480000::Caleb, what you call home improvement?
0:22:02.480000 - 0:22:03.480000::Right.
0:22:03.480000 - 0:22:05.080000::Yeah.
0:22:05.080000 - 0:22:08.240000::You would be a good, if you played the kid on home improvement now,
0:22:08.240000 - 0:22:09.360000::but you're an adult.
0:22:09.360000 - 0:22:10.360000::Oh, that'd be cool.
0:22:10.360000 - 0:22:12.120000::Remember the blind lady on that show?
0:22:12.120000 - 0:22:14.360000::Remember that episode when he gets the disease.

0:22:37.520000 - 0:22:38.520000::But they can't.
0:22:38.520000 - 0:22:40.120000::This is what you need to say.
0:22:40.120000 - 0:22:41.120000::That's what they're saying in an adult.
0:22:41.120000 - 0:22:44.680000::No, if somebody's in a situation like that, I don't know what the situation is because
0:22:44.680000 - 0:22:48.720000::I don't know what you guys are talking about, but I assume it's not good.
0:22:48.720000 - 0:22:54.440000::Instead of saying, denying the situation, just say, it's going to be okay.
0:22:54.440000 - 0:22:56.560000::This is a part of life.
0:22:56.560000 - 0:22:59.720000::Don't say, I'm not going to let this happen.
0:22:59.720000 - 0:23:02.760000::That's setting them up to not feel good.
0:23:02.760000 - 0:23:03.760000::Yeah.
0:23:03.760000 - 0:23:04.760000::Right.

0:23:57.840000 - 0:24:01.440000::It was a little kid I had chicken pox and I was watching that crying.
0:24:01.440000 - 0:24:08.440000::And my brother was like, well, no, my I just was the story really touched me because I
0:24:08.440000 - 0:24:10.360000::had thought about my parents getting cancer.
0:24:10.360000 - 0:24:11.360000::They didn't have it at all.
0:24:11.360000 - 0:24:13.040000::But and I'd never known anybody that had it.
0:24:13.040000 - 0:24:14.520000::But I got worried about it.
0:24:14.520000 - 0:24:15.520000::Yeah.
0:24:15.520000 - 0:24:16.520000::Okay, pussy.

0:24:24.360000 - 0:24:27.960000::And I said that it was the pain from the chicken pox and I didn't care about this at all.
0:24:27.960000 - 0:24:28.960000::Yeah, chicken pox.
0:24:28.960000 - 0:24:29.960000::What the moral of the story?
0:24:29.960000 - 0:24:30.960000::You were hanging right.
0:24:30.960000 - 0:24:33.720000::Well, he was on the other side of that room.
0:24:33.720000 - 0:24:34.960000::Oh, yeah.

0:24:42.280000 - 0:24:45.760000::And it lets him fast forward parts of his life that he finds to be boring.
0:24:45.760000 - 0:24:49.240000::So he just is able to experience the good parts of life.
0:24:49.240000 - 0:24:51.640000::He's able to have sex really fast with his wife.
0:24:51.640000 - 0:24:53.480000::He's able to fast forward all of his kids.
0:24:53.480000 - 0:24:54.480000::Guys, guys, always.
0:24:54.480000 - 0:24:59.680000::He gets that shit over with just how we like to do it.
0:24:59.680000 - 0:25:00::We don't want to.

0:25:00 - 0:25:01.840000::I'm gonna be doing this disgusting shit.

0:25:03.360000 - 0:25:05.680000::But then what happens, he ends up fast forwarding.
0:25:05.680000 - 0:25:08.360000::He's like, well, by skipping all the pain in life,
0:25:09.600000 - 0:25:12.240000::you don't get, you know what I mean?

0:25:16.320000 - 0:25:17.160000::Was it for pain?
0:25:17.160000 - 0:25:18.160000::It wasn't for pain.
0:25:18.160000 - 0:25:19::Did you say it?
0:25:19 - 0:25:21.840000::The best part of that movie is at the end
0:25:21.840000 - 0:25:24::when it gets all rewinded and stuff.
0:25:24 - 0:25:26::And it's like, you still have to,
0:25:26 - 0:25:27.720000::you're still gonna die of cancer, right?
0:25:27.720000 - 0:25:29.640000::Like isn't that just your life is still gonna happen?
0:25:29.640000 - 0:25:31::You just have to do it a second time.
0:25:31 - 0:25:33.240000::Well, that was a dream.
0:25:33.240000 - 0:25:34.360000::Oh, is it a dream?

0:25:35.200000 - 0:25:36.280000::Oh, you're right.
0:25:36.280000 - 0:25:39.240000::But there's a little bit of a wake to the camera thing, I think,
0:25:39.240000 - 0:25:43.720000::where Christopher Walken's guy is like, just like,
0:25:43.720000 - 0:25:45.480000::I have them seriously real.
0:25:45.480000 - 0:25:47.760000::Dude, have you seen Ghost Ship?
0:25:47.760000 - 0:25:50.280000::I've seen the beginning of it where they get sliced out.
0:25:50.280000 - 0:25:51.840000::Where they get sliced except for the little kid.
0:25:51.840000 - 0:25:53.480000::There's two scenes, you need, yeah,
0:25:53.480000 - 0:25:55.800000::there's two scenes that you need to see on Ghost Ship.
0:25:55.800000 - 0:25:57.960000::Okay, have we talked about this movie?
0:25:58.080000 - 0:25:59.520000::I feel like I've never heard of this.
0:25:59.520000 - 0:26:00.600000::I'm over after that scene, right?
0:26:00.600000 - 0:26:01.440000::Everybody's dead.
0:26:01.440000 - 0:26:02.760000::No, dude, there's one more scene.
0:26:02.760000 - 0:26:04.880000::Oh, there's one more scene that rules.
0:26:04.880000 - 0:26:08.600000::This is a spoiler alert, but it's one of my favorite scenes ever.
0:26:08.600000 - 0:26:10.560000::So in the beginning of the movie, whatever,
0:26:10.560000 - 0:26:12.200000::I was just set up the premise.
0:26:12.200000 - 0:26:13.840000::There's a ship, a party on a ship,
0:26:13.840000 - 0:26:17.240000::everybody's dancing, and then some cord gets snapped,
0:26:17.240000 - 0:26:20.720000::and it slices every single tall person, adult height person,
0:26:20.720000 - 0:26:23.400000::in half, across the whole ship,
0:26:23.400000 - 0:26:24.560000::and they all get sliced and have
0:26:24.560000 - 0:26:25.560000::except for a short little girl,
0:26:25.560000 - 0:26:27.480000::and she becomes a ghost.
0:26:28.440000 - 0:26:30.560000::Then the last scene of the movie,
0:26:30.560000 - 0:26:35.280000::they are all kind of fighting this dude
0:26:35.280000 - 0:26:37.720000::who's like a possessed demon, I guess, or something.
0:26:37.720000 - 0:26:39::I could be getting this wrong.
0:26:39 - 0:26:42::Basically, they think they've killed him,
0:26:42 - 0:26:44.480000::and they're trying to get the treasure off the boat,
0:26:44.480000 - 0:26:46.840000::like the cops are something I take
0:26:46.840000 - 0:26:48.320000::and the treasure off the boat.
0:26:48.320000 - 0:26:50.080000::There's treasure on the boat.
0:26:50.080000 - 0:26:54.440000::And then the person who won is like,
0:26:54.440000 - 0:26:56.320000::who's the hero of the movie
0:26:56.320000 - 0:27:00.360000::is getting loaded on a stretcher into the ambulance.
0:27:00.360000 - 0:27:03.080000::And as the doors are closing, they see
0:27:03.080000 - 0:27:05.680000::one of the people carrying the stuff off the boat
0:27:06.680000 - 0:27:09.840000::is the fucking ghost.
0:27:10.680000 - 0:27:12::And as the ambulance doors are closing,
0:27:12 - 0:27:13.920000::they look at them and this metal music starts playing...
0:27:13.920000 - 0:27:16.800000::Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
0:27:16.800000 - 0:27:18.880000::And they see it, and goes, yeah.
0:27:18.880000 - 0:27:20.040000::Pwugh.
0:27:20.040000 - 0:27:21.520000::Push it down.
0:27:21.520000 - 0:27:23.800000::How I've never heard of this movie.

0:42:35.700000 - 0:42:41.300000::Harlan and then coming back to I know I feel like it's like I hate my normal voice
0:42:41.300000 - 0:42:46.100000::I fucking hate my words. We talked about this. You hate your voice. I want to kill it
0:42:46.100000 - 0:42:49.060000::Yeah, such a wonderful voice. My voice sucks
0:42:49.060000 - 0:42:53.020000::If you ever think about how when you're like a when you're a 50 year old man

0:43:27.660000 - 0:43:31.420000::There's something about the way they talked in those movies Al Pacino. It's so gentle
0:43:31.700000 - 0:43:39.040000::And they really embrace the quiet name but they embrace the slowness of life and actually that builds tension and
0:43:40.020000 - 0:43:42.020000::I'm gonna
0:43:42.020000 - 0:43:47.660000::He's not doing that. He's saying you betrayed me my brother. You betray. I know what you did Fredo

0:44:01.420000 - 0:44:07.860000::No, I would have fallen into the devices. Oh, I see you feel like maybe the drugs like the cocaine there
0:44:07.860000 - 0:44:11.020000::People always say the weed wasn't strong. I feel like the cocaine probably wasn't as strong, you know

0:44:36.340000 - 0:44:38.340000::We're just on another level now
0:44:38.660000 - 0:44:42.620000::Man, I feel like my mom still kind of cooks like it's the 1970s

0:46:06.140000 - 0:46:08.140000::Now what do they do? Imagine if you were born
0:46:08.140000 - 0:46:10.140000::now they're the food though. Well, imagine this.
0:46:10.140000 - 0:46:12.140000::Yes, you're the food. So you're going to die anyways.
0:46:12.140000 - 0:46:14.140000::But imagine if you were born into
0:46:14.140000 - 0:46:16.140000::like a house with a hundred thousand of
0:46:16.140000 - 0:46:17.140000::your homies chilling on a
0:46:17.140000 - 0:46:20.140000::10. That's like, and there's a hundred
0:46:20.140000 - 0:46:22.140000::thousand. Oh, you do. You do
0:46:22.140000 - 0:46:24.140000::it. All you do in all day.
0:46:24.140000 - 0:46:26.140000::You're going to be in a house with a
0:46:26.140000 - 0:46:28.140000::hundred thousand people.
0:46:28.140000 - 0:46:30.140000::And they do it at seven a.m. wake up.
0:46:30.140000 - 0:46:32.140000::When they hear the phone. Oh, shit.
0:46:32.140000 - 0:46:34.140000::We're all waking up. Yeah.
0:46:34.140000 - 0:46:36.140000::And then all of a sudden all these just
0:46:36.140000 - 0:46:38.140000::fucking donuts start popping in your mouth.
0:46:38.140000 - 0:46:40.140000::All day. It's all you got. Donuts all around you on the floor
0:46:40.140000 - 0:46:42.140000::everywhere. I got to eat them
0:46:42.140000 - 0:46:44.140000::out the floor though. Where's this guy?
0:46:44.140000 - 0:46:46.140000::You want a silver platter. And then you just do that
0:46:46.140000 - 0:46:48.140000::your whole life and then somebody comes
0:46:48.140000 - 0:46:50.140000::and flips your head off. Oh, I see.
0:46:50.140000 - 0:46:52.140000::That's as you turn to.
0:46:52.140000 - 0:46:54.140000::You're ever. Oh, no. But in chicken years,
0:46:54.140000 - 0:46:56.140000::that's like 90. I don't know how long a chicken lives.
0:46:56.140000 - 0:46:58.140000::Let's go. Let's go. Very long.
0:46:58.140000 - 0:47:00.140000::Well, let me tell you this at the
0:47:00.140000 - 0:47:02.140000::Museum of Science and Industry in

0:48:01.140000 - 0:48:03.140000::Commoto dragons have the most poisonous spit.
0:48:03.140000 - 0:48:04.140000::Oh, animal.
0:48:04.140000 - 0:48:05.140000::And they'll shoot it really.

0:48:06.140000 - 0:48:07.140000::Yes. That's how they kill their prey.
0:48:07.140000 - 0:48:09.140000::They sink their teeth into them.
0:48:09.140000 - 0:48:12.140000::And their spit is so poisonous that they just crumble
0:48:12.140000 - 0:48:13.140000::and they just kind of die.
0:48:13.140000 - 0:48:15.140000::And then they knock on them.
0:48:15.140000 - 0:48:17.140000::They'll lick you from across the room with it.
0:48:17.140000 - 0:48:18.140000::The bleak.

0:48:20.140000 - 0:48:21.140000::They didn't make the scientists.
0:48:21.140000 - 0:48:24.140000::Scientists have him at my fucking bus driver growing up yet.
0:48:24.140000 - 0:48:26.140000::If they think that's the worst spit on the planet.
0:48:26.140000 - 0:48:27.140000::He's waiting.
0:48:27.140000 - 0:48:32.140000::He's spit in the fucking metal would rust off immediately on the bus.
0:48:32.140000 - 0:48:34.140000::Were you guys actually a fool on the bus?
0:48:34.140000 - 0:48:35.140000::I would do the gentle.
0:48:35.140000 - 0:48:36.140000::He didn't do the bus.
0:48:36.140000 - 0:48:39.140000::We would play a game where we'd see who could hit our head the hardest
0:48:39.140000 - 0:48:40.140000::on the ceiling of the bus.
0:48:40.140000 - 0:48:41.140000::Boink.
0:48:41.140000 - 0:48:43.140000::You would win to do your height.
0:48:43.140000 - 0:48:46.140000::Well, if you had strong legs, that person probably.
0:48:46.140000 - 0:48:47.140000::Oh, yeah, strong.
0:48:47.140000 - 0:48:51.140000::I was watching these kids play one-on-one full-court basketball
0:48:51.140000 - 0:48:52.140000::last weekend.
0:48:52.140000 - 0:48:54.140000::One of them was probably five years old.
0:48:54.140000 - 0:48:55.140000::The other one was probably six years old.
0:48:55.140000 - 0:48:56.140000::And they were crushing you.
0:48:56.140000 - 0:48:57.140000::They were about a foot tall.
0:48:57.140000 - 0:48:58.140000::They were so fucking short.
0:48:58.140000 - 0:49:00.140000::And they're playing full-court.
0:49:00.140000 - 0:49:03.140000::It was taking them so long to get from the end.
0:49:03.140000 - 0:49:07.140000::And the way they would try with everything they had to make a basket
0:49:07.140000 - 0:49:08.140000::because they're so fucking small.
0:49:08.140000 - 0:49:09.140000::Yeah.
0:49:09.140000 - 0:49:10.140000::Yeah.
0:49:10.140000 - 0:49:12.140000::If you saw a five-year-old dunk.
0:49:12.140000 - 0:49:14.140000::Would you report after the backboard?
0:49:14.140000 - 0:49:15.140000::Report under the army.
0:49:15.140000 - 0:49:16.140000::Yeah.
0:49:16.140000 - 0:49:17.140000::Yeah.
0:49:17.140000 - 0:49:18.140000::You have to come kill him.
0:49:18.140000 - 0:49:19.140000::Yeah.
0:49:19.140000 - 0:49:20.140000::Yeah.
0:49:20.140000 - 0:49:24.140000::We need a cultural type of thing like that, where if you see a child that is
0:49:24.140000 - 0:49:28.140000::like kind of extra more violent than the other children,
0:49:28.140000 - 0:49:32.140000::we should let the military know about them right off the bat.
0:49:32.140000 - 0:49:34.140000::Because our military fucking sucks right now.
0:49:34.140000 - 0:49:35.140000::Oh, yeah.
0:49:35.140000 - 0:49:36.140000::This is the happening Afghanistan.
0:49:36.140000 - 0:49:39.140000::If we had all the fucking violent strong kids, that way, everybody was,
0:49:39.140000 - 0:49:40.140000::Oh, my God, I would have been.
0:49:40.140000 - 0:49:41.140000::Let's just have the body count.
0:49:41.140000 - 0:49:42.140000::10 times a piece.
0:49:42.140000 - 0:49:43.140000::Yeah.
0:49:43.140000 - 0:49:44.140000::Exactly.

0:55:23 - 0:55:26.720000::they're going to maybe bet on a stock market, go to a casino,
0:55:26.720000 - 0:55:29.480000::but what a businessman does, what a genius does,

0:55:40.880000 - 0:55:44.840000::And I was like, I don't think that's turning it into two million dollars,
0:55:44.840000 - 0:55:46.840000::right? That's just getting a million dollar loan.
0:55:46.840000 - 0:55:47.680000::Right.
