0:00:05 - 0:00:07::Yoda just laying it down.
0:00:07 - 0:00:09::I can.

0:00:34 - 0:00:37::And I'm ready to start off this year with a bang.
0:00:37 - 0:00:42::I expect nothing more from you, man. So the stock market today, the S&P 500 record remains elusive in the final train 823.
0:00:42 - 0:00:46::What are we taking away from this? How are we moving into Q1, Eric?
0:00:46 - 0:00:48::How is your portfolio looking today?
0:00:48 - 0:00:52::Well, my portfolio is looking amazing. I just cashed out my 401k to pay for rent.
0:00:52 - 0:01:01::So basically, I just need to back up real quick. This is the new us. This is the new Joy Tactics, by the way.
0:01:01 - 0:01:09::What you're just listening to. We're going to be covering the stock market in detail, the analysis of puts and different type of stock options that you can put.
0:01:09 - 0:01:13::It's going to be. This is basically the new us. This is 2024.
0:01:13 - 0:01:16::All right. You're not changing. You're not fucking growing. All right.
0:01:16 - 0:01:18::Look at my eyes.
0:01:18 - 0:01:20::Wow.
0:01:20 - 0:01:25::Can you see right now? Can you? Yeah. I can see fully.
0:01:25 - 0:01:32::I literally can't see because I have these sunglasses that I'm wearing right now are not prescription.
0:01:32 - 0:01:40::And I don't have any contacts under this. So and I literally my vision is so bad that I can barely see the you guys in the zoom recording.
0:01:40 - 0:01:44::That is maybe what three feet in front of my face.
0:01:44 - 0:01:50::So do you put those on when you get too stimulated? You maybe go into like a McDonald's and it starts freaking you out.
0:01:50 - 0:01:53::All the noises in the imagery.
0:01:53 - 0:02:00::So you got to make Donald's to set up the laptop and get working.
0:02:00 - 0:02:02::And you get to distracted.
0:02:02 - 0:02:05::I don't understand is what?
0:02:05 - 0:02:15::You know how like you see rappers and celebrities. They're like always wearing sunglasses like at in places at night like in a club.
0:02:15 - 0:02:22::And it's like that would annoy the fuck out of me to be wearing sunglasses like in a dark, you know club.
0:02:22 - 0:02:30::Well, when you get faded off of amazing drugs, your your pupils become enriched with light. Do you understand?
0:02:30 - 0:02:32::Thank you for letting. Okay.
0:02:32 - 0:02:35::I'm sorry. I didn't know that made it up.
0:02:35 - 0:02:38::Well, sorry.
0:02:38 - 0:02:40::Horrible happened to me.
0:02:40 - 0:02:43::Eric said he's sitting on two or three things.
0:02:43 - 0:02:53::You guys both look like you got kicked out of like a metal band, you know, we're for being too ethical.
0:02:53 - 0:02:58::We like all the month. We were at it on the end to their wives for being mad on the road.
0:02:58 - 0:03:03::These lyrics are not helping people. These lyrics are fucking disturbing the children.
0:03:03 - 0:03:09::The things that I'm sitting on now that I think about it, I thought they would come up organically, but they're the most boring things.
0:03:09 - 0:03:11::All right, kick it off, man.
0:03:11 - 0:03:13::Last night I made some steak.
0:03:13 - 0:03:17::And while I was eating the steak, I was eating them in my new UGS.
0:03:17 - 0:03:22::Okay. I got some new UGS, the mini UGS for Christmas.
0:03:22 - 0:03:24::Where are you going with this man?
0:03:24 - 0:03:27::And a little piece fell onto the UGS.
0:03:27 - 0:03:29::Okay. And the grease went onto the UGS.
0:03:29 - 0:03:31::So I had to try to clean the UGS.
0:03:31 - 0:03:34::And I didn't realize how sensitive UGS are to water.
0:03:34 - 0:03:37::And I'm wiping it, wiping it.
0:03:37 - 0:03:39::Oh, the grease thing goes away.
0:03:39 - 0:03:42::But now there's a big fat water stain on my UGS.
0:03:42 - 0:03:44::And it won't go away.
0:03:44 - 0:03:46::Even if you dry it.
0:03:46 - 0:03:49::I dried it and I even started putting cornstarch on it.
0:03:49 - 0:03:52::Well, what did it, why don't you dip the whole thing in water?
0:03:52 - 0:03:54::That's what I am seeing online.
0:03:54 - 0:03:56::People saying, just get it all wet.
0:03:56 - 0:03:57::So it's the same color.
0:03:57 - 0:04:00::That's my last resort, but I don't want to be pushed to that.
0:04:00 - 0:04:02::Well, what's the opposite of pushed to water?
0:04:02 - 0:04:04::Why don't you want to, why don't you, why don't you, uh,
0:04:04 - 0:04:05::fire on it?
0:04:05 - 0:04:06::Is it darker or lighter? Do you understand?
0:04:06 - 0:04:07::It's darker.
0:04:07 - 0:04:09::So then what's lighter than water?
0:04:09 - 0:04:11::Men's.
0:04:11 - 0:04:12::Okay.
0:04:12 - 0:04:14::I should have texted you guys.
0:04:14 - 0:04:15::You immediately.
0:04:15 - 0:04:17::Immediately. Don't ever do that again.
0:04:17 - 0:04:18::Don't ever go to Reddit.
0:04:18 - 0:04:19::Anybody?
0:04:19 - 0:04:20::I'm staying away.
0:04:20 - 0:04:21::Okay.
0:04:21 - 0:04:22::So that's one of my things I said.
0:04:22 - 0:04:25::I was sitting on, couldn't wait to if I can go off on it on the podcast.
0:04:25 - 0:04:26::Yeah.
0:04:26 - 0:04:27::And it was fruitful.
0:04:27 - 0:04:30::We got, we almost got a full riff off of that.
0:04:30 - 0:04:31::We got pretty close.
0:04:31 - 0:04:34::And we're already at four minutes in the fucking podcast.
0:04:34 - 0:04:35::Wow.
0:04:35 - 0:04:39::So what's the other thing Eric?
0:04:39 - 0:04:43::This is, we discussed this before and you were like, oh, I have to,
0:04:43 - 0:04:48::like sometimes we're chatting, we, we probably talked for like 15, 20 minutes before
0:04:48 - 0:04:52::and we just waste time like nobody's business.
0:04:52 - 0:04:57::And, and like Eric was just like, you know, we just talk, we just chit chat, you know.
0:04:57 - 0:05:00::And Eric was like, about to bring this

0:05:00 - 0:05:04.160000::and he's like, oh my God, I have to save this for the podcast.
0:05:04.160000 - 0:05:05.920000::This is so fucking interesting.
0:05:05.920000 - 0:05:06.760000::Now, I'll tell you what happened.
0:05:06.760000 - 0:05:09.520000::I started saying my piece and Jack said,
0:05:09.520000 - 0:05:11.080000::save it for the podcast.
0:05:11.080000 - 0:05:13.960000::I don't appreciate my words being twisted like this.
0:05:13.960000 - 0:05:14.960000::In front of the public audience.
0:05:14.960000 - 0:05:16.880000::Oh, sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
0:05:16.880000 - 0:05:19.080000::I've angered you.
0:05:19.080000 - 0:05:22.040000::I wanted to tell you guys about all my groceries that I got.
0:05:22.040000 - 0:05:24.200000::I said, here's how it went.
0:05:24.200000 - 0:05:26.400000::I said, do you guys know when you walk out of a grocery store
0:05:26.400000 - 0:05:29.320000::and you just feel so good about the groceries you got?
0:05:29.320000 - 0:05:30.640000::So that happened to me yesterday.
0:05:30.640000 - 0:05:32.120000::I got some steak.
0:05:32.120000 - 0:05:35.400000::Jack said, wait, save it for the podcast.
0:05:35.400000 - 0:05:37.280000::Let it this be heard by everybody.
0:05:37.280000 - 0:05:40.600000::Okay, just so we're on the same page, that's what happened.
0:05:40.600000 - 0:05:41.600000::That's the story.
0:05:41.600000 - 0:05:43::I'm fucking sorry.
0:05:43 - 0:05:45.040000::Well, that's true about that story,
0:05:45.040000 - 0:05:48.600000::but you did say what Nate said about another about.
0:05:48.600000 - 0:05:50.400000::Right, that's about hot tub time machine.
0:05:50.400000 - 0:05:51.240000::I watched that last night.
0:05:51.240000 - 0:05:52.240000::It was amazing.
0:05:52.240000 - 0:05:57.800000::I hadn't seen that one in about 14 years
0:05:57.800000 - 0:05:59.440000::and it was making me laugh.
0:05:59.440000 - 0:06:01.160000::Is there pedophilia in that?
0:06:01.160000 - 0:06:05.200000::So you know, I guess so in a sense.
0:06:05.200000 - 0:06:07.240000::Yes, they're remembered that.
0:06:07.240000 - 0:06:09.800000::But they're back in their high school bodies.
0:06:09.800000 - 0:06:12.040000::Right, so you can't really know.
0:06:12.040000 - 0:06:13.600000::And then it's like, what if the mind
0:06:13.600000 - 0:06:16::is the actual final determination?
0:06:16 - 0:06:16.840000::That's right.
0:06:16.840000 - 0:06:18.880000::And I just realized something about perverts, man.
0:06:18.880000 - 0:06:22.080000::So you know how some people call themselves old souls?
0:06:22.080000 - 0:06:23.240000::You have course.
0:06:23.240000 - 0:06:25.200000::That makes you a pedophile, doesn't it?
0:06:25.200000 - 0:06:26.800000::Technically.
0:06:26.800000 - 0:06:28.640000::Have an old soul.
0:06:28.640000 - 0:06:37::You're praying on top modern day souls.
0:06:37 - 0:06:37.840000::That's so true.
0:06:37.840000 - 0:06:41.360000::It's like a mental, mental perversion,
0:06:41.360000 - 0:06:44.640000::which is the title of this episode.
0:06:44.640000 - 0:06:48.320000::If I could do a chance, some type of ancient chance,
0:06:48.320000 - 0:06:52.720000::some type of spell, and eliminate all perversion from the world,
0:06:52.720000 - 0:06:56.040000::you know how quick I'd be saying that shit?
0:06:56.040000 - 0:06:58.280000::No more perversion.
0:06:58.280000 - 0:07:01.240000::OK, I'm sick of this because a lot of things
0:07:01.240000 - 0:07:04.920000::that you guys find so perverted is actually liberating
0:07:04.920000 - 0:07:07.480000::and it's empowering to a lot of people.
0:07:07.480000 - 0:07:10.360000::And I'm sick of this conservative take,
0:07:10.360000 - 0:07:13.320000::this puritanical take on sexuality.
0:07:13.320000 - 0:07:15.480000::This is a sex positive podcast, all right?
0:07:15.480000 - 0:07:16.680000::We're talking about nuts.
0:07:16.680000 - 0:07:19.200000::We're talking about fucking dicks, pussies,
0:07:19.200000 - 0:07:20.480000::assholes, everything.
0:07:20.480000 - 0:07:23.080000::Because it's sex positive on the on joy tactics.
0:07:23.080000 - 0:07:27.520000::And I will not stand for this type of demon demon, demon
0:07:27.520000 - 0:07:28.520000::defecation.
0:07:28.520000 - 0:07:29.520000::Demon defecation.
0:07:29.520000 - 0:07:31.720000::Yeah, it monitors that you got it.
0:07:31.720000 - 0:07:34.320000::What's going on?
0:07:34.320000 - 0:07:38.120000::Nate, you know, the hoodie, the glasses.
0:07:38.120000 - 0:07:39.120000::What's going on?
0:07:39.120000 - 0:07:42::Some about being in Ohio has been around the dark night.
0:07:42 - 0:07:44.440000::This is the scariest decor I've ever seen.
0:07:44.440000 - 0:07:49.400000::You have the funeral table in the back or behind you.
0:07:49.400000 - 0:07:53.680000::With the flowers, resting piece.
0:07:53.680000 - 0:07:56.600000::Yeah, it looks like this all looks like somebody died in here
0:07:56.600000 - 0:08:00.440000::in 2006, maybe in 2004.
0:08:00.440000 - 0:08:01.640000::And they were afraid to throw anything away.
0:08:01.640000 - 0:08:02.640000::Come to Ohio, man.
0:08:02.640000 - 0:08:04.600000::You would be dressing like this and acting like this,
0:08:04.600000 - 0:08:05.680000::if you were here.
0:08:05.680000 - 0:08:06.440000::Jack, you know what?
0:08:06.440000 - 0:08:07.400000::I was thinking about this.
0:08:07.400000 - 0:08:11.040000::I was just rolling around Toledo, Ohio, driving around.
0:08:11.040000 - 0:08:16.120000::And I was like, dude, Jack, you would fucking love Toledo.
0:08:16.120000 - 0:08:20.200000::I feel like you need to come to Toledo, Ohio, man.
0:08:20.200000 - 0:08:23.320000::You would fucking, I feel like you're maybe like meant to be here.
0:08:23.320000 - 0:08:24.320000::I'm afraid to go.
0:08:24.320000 - 0:08:25.840000::Is it the chicken wings?
0:08:25.840000 - 0:08:27.720000::What is the skate spots?
0:08:27.720000 - 0:08:30.160000::It's literally like every part of it.
0:08:30.160000 - 0:08:34.280000::Like every restaurant, I feel like it's just like geared towards Jack,
0:08:34.280000 - 0:08:37.440000::like every bar, every establishment.
0:08:37.440000 - 0:08:42.600000::It just feels like you would, I feel like you would really find like true happiness.
0:08:42.600000 - 0:08:45.240000::Like you might know what happiness is in your life,
0:08:45.240000 - 0:08:49.200000::but once you come to Toledo, Ohio, and get the fucking,
0:08:49.200000 - 0:08:53.080000::the tube bedroom, you know, house here,
0:08:53.080000 - 0:08:54.680000::you have a little yard.
0:08:54.680000 - 0:08:55.800000::That sounds a fucking amazing.
0:08:55.800000 - 0:08:57.440000::Does it snow there a little bit sometimes?
0:08:57.440000 - 0:08:58.040000::It snowes.
0:08:58.040000 - 0:09:01.080000::It's always dreary, you know, but.
0:09:01.080000 - 0:09:04.200000::There's probably an indoor skate park with no like heating.
0:09:04.200000 - 0:09:05.880000::No, I could help out right there.
0:09:05.880000 - 0:09:06.880000::Oh, for sure.
0:09:06.880000 - 0:09:11.240000::Jack, you got to go do the Nagaof Keatley treatment to Toledo.
0:09:11.240000 - 0:09:12.240000::And the rest of the...
0:09:12.240000 - 0:09:13.080000::Keatley?
0:09:13.080000 - 0:09:14.080000::Keatley.
0:09:14.080000 - 0:09:15.080000::Oh.
0:09:16.520000 - 0:09:17.440000::What's that?
0:09:17.440000 - 0:09:19.080000::You guys know Keith Lee.
0:09:19.080000 - 0:09:20.640000::Did he kill himself?
0:09:20.640000 - 0:09:21.480000::No, he did.
0:09:21.480000 - 0:09:25.560000::He's a new, he's a rising internet star that's saving small businesses,
0:09:25.560000 - 0:09:26.720000::small restaurants.
0:09:27.800000 - 0:09:28.640000::Okay.
0:09:28.640000 - 0:09:33.480000::He goes to sort of struggling small restaurants across the country.
0:09:33.480000 - 0:09:34.400000::He just came to New York.
0:09:34.400000 - 0:09:38.680000::It was very controversial because people think he went to the wrong places.
0:09:38.680000 - 0:09:43.040000::But he mysteriously gets the food, eats it, reviews it.
0:09:43.040000 - 0:09:48.480000::And once he reviews that shit, those businesses become very popular.
0:09:48.480000 - 0:09:49.600000::I'll just help you know what I'm saying.
0:09:49.600000 - 0:09:51.520000::Can I ask a question about Keith Lee?
0:09:51.520000 - 0:09:52.440000::Yeah.
0:09:52.440000 - 0:09:56.520000::What is his age and race?
0:09:58.760000 - 0:10:00::Keith, you know,

0:10:00 - 0:10:01.960000::I don't know, you have no idea what he looks like.
0:10:01.960000 - 0:10:03.760000::No, I don't know even know who he is.
0:10:03.760000 - 0:10:08.240000::Keith Lee is probably 30, maybe 28, he's black,
0:10:08.240000 - 0:10:10.280000::he's an amazing guy.
0:10:10.280000 - 0:10:11.480000::Oh, okay.
0:10:11.480000 - 0:10:13.160000::I don't know, I was thinking he would be like some.
0:10:13.160000 - 0:10:14::Why didn't you?
0:10:14 - 0:10:16.200000::I'm so curious to know why, right?
0:10:16.200000 - 0:10:17.960000::Every time you ask about somebody,
0:10:17.960000 - 0:10:19.400000::especially when you got those glasses on,
0:10:19.400000 - 0:10:20.760000::you say, what race are they?
0:10:20.760000 - 0:10:23.320000::That's the first thing you wanna know about everybody.
0:10:23.320000 - 0:10:24.520000::And it disturbs me.
0:10:24.520000 - 0:10:27.160000::I'm not disturbed because he's in the reverse KKK right now.
0:10:27.160000 - 0:10:28::He's in the full black.
0:10:28 - 0:10:29.800000::You're in the KKK adventures.
0:10:29.800000 - 0:10:32.840000::You know, the ones that take them out, I mean,
0:10:32.840000 - 0:10:33.680000::you know what I'm saying?
0:10:33.680000 - 0:10:34.680000::Exactly.
0:10:34.680000 - 0:10:36.080000::Is that Snators?
0:10:36.080000 - 0:10:38.760000::What's the opposite of K?
0:10:38.760000 - 0:10:40.840000::Well, K is the 10th letter of the alphabet.
0:10:40.840000 - 0:10:43.040000::Did I just do that that fast?
0:10:43.040000 - 0:10:44.920000::No way.
0:10:44.920000 - 0:10:49.120000::A-D-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-J-D-L.
0:10:49.120000 - 0:10:52.120000::Okay, Z-E-L.
0:10:52.120000 - 0:10:53.840000::You could have gone nuts, too, if you could.
0:10:53.840000 - 0:10:55.840000::I'll keep you from being like 10 K.
0:10:55.840000 - 0:10:57.840000::Oh!
0:10:57.840000 - 0:10:58.840000::The clip.
0:10:58.840000 - 0:11:00.840000::Oh, shit.
0:11:00.840000 - 0:11:02.840000::My man.
0:11:02.840000 - 0:11:04.840000::Oh, no fucking way.
0:11:04.840000 - 0:11:05.840000::Yeah, yeah.
0:11:05.840000 - 0:11:06.840000::10, 10.
0:11:06.840000 - 0:11:07.840000::Try yourself.
0:11:07.840000 - 0:11:08.840000::It's 10.
0:11:08.840000 - 0:11:09.840000::It's not.
0:11:09.840000 - 0:11:10.840000::So what's the opposite of 11?
0:11:10.840000 - 0:11:11.840000::Let's move on.
0:11:11.840000 - 0:11:13.840000::Well, yeah, no problem.
0:11:13.840000 - 0:11:14.840000::Well, can I ask why?
0:11:14.840000 - 0:11:16.840000::Can I say why I asked the race?
0:11:16.840000 - 0:11:17.840000::I thought he would be...
0:11:17.840000 - 0:11:20.840000::I thought he was a white man.
0:11:20.840000 - 0:11:21.840000::Oh.
0:11:21.840000 - 0:11:23.840000::That was going to all these struggling small business.
0:11:23.840000 - 0:11:24.840000::That's another problem of each man.
0:11:24.840000 - 0:11:26.840000::That assumption is so curious.
0:11:26.840000 - 0:11:30.840000::Well, I'm very suspicious of the white race
0:11:30.840000 - 0:11:33.840000::and they're going around to these small businesses
0:11:33.840000 - 0:11:36.840000::that are owned by immigrants who are coming to America
0:11:36.840000 - 0:11:39.840000::and they're trying to push their values onto, you know,
0:11:39.840000 - 0:11:41.840000::that's what I thought this was.
0:11:41.840000 - 0:11:42.840000::Very soon.
0:11:42.840000 - 0:11:43.840000::And that's why I thought.
0:11:43.840000 - 0:11:44.840000::When you said it was controversial, he was coming.
0:11:44.840000 - 0:11:48.840000::I thought, oh, is this because this is a white, a young white guy
0:11:48.840000 - 0:11:49.840000::who's like, I'm going to change up this.
0:11:49.840000 - 0:11:50.840000::No, no, no.
0:11:50.840000 - 0:11:51.840000::Right.
0:11:51.840000 - 0:11:52.840000::Nathan, for you, style.
0:11:53.840000 - 0:11:54.840000::Okay.
0:11:54.840000 - 0:11:55.840000::Keith Lee's rocking it.
0:11:55.840000 - 0:11:56.840000::There are some other people, though.
0:11:56.840000 - 0:11:59.840000::Do you guys know this guy on TikTok called like
0:11:59.840000 - 0:12:02.840000::Johnny Darts or something?
0:12:02.840000 - 0:12:03.840000::I love Darts.
0:12:03.840000 - 0:12:05.840000::And he goes up to people and he's like,
0:12:05.840000 - 0:12:07.840000::clearly holding his phone
0:12:07.840000 - 0:12:09.840000::and he goes like, he's in a grocery store.
0:12:09.840000 - 0:12:12.840000::He's like, hey, can you help me buy this box of
0:12:12.840000 - 0:12:13.840000::veggies?
0:12:13.840000 - 0:12:14.840000::I'm so hungry, man.
0:12:14.840000 - 0:12:17.840000::He's probably decked out in Lululemon.
0:12:17.840000 - 0:12:18.840000::You know what I'm saying?
0:12:18.840000 - 0:12:19.840000::He's got the fucking...
0:12:19.840000 - 0:12:20.840000::Lululemon.
0:12:20.840000 - 0:12:21.840000::You know, whatever.
0:12:21.840000 - 0:12:23.840000::He's got the white people swag on.
0:12:23.840000 - 0:12:24.840000::That's leisure.
0:12:24.840000 - 0:12:26.840000::Clearly he doesn't need the $2.
0:12:26.840000 - 0:12:29.840000::And some people say no and they don't get the $10,000.
0:12:29.840000 - 0:12:31.840000::Some people say yes.
0:12:31.840000 - 0:12:32.840000::And then he blesses them.
0:12:32.840000 - 0:12:35.840000::He says, actually, I'm not poor.
0:12:35.840000 - 0:12:38.840000::And actually, here's $5,000.
0:12:38.840000 - 0:12:41.840000::And so what he's doing there, by the way, is he's rewarding.
0:12:41.840000 - 0:12:44.840000::He's rewarding people who are struggling for making financial
0:12:44.840000 - 0:12:45.840000::your financial year responsible.
0:12:45.840000 - 0:12:46.840000::Right.
0:12:46.840000 - 0:12:48.840000::These people should not be helping out strangers.
0:12:48.840000 - 0:12:51.840000::They need to focus on a money market account.
0:12:51.840000 - 0:12:54.840000::You know, putting that $2 in the money market account and seeing that
0:12:54.840000 - 0:12:56.840000::grow within the 100 years.
0:12:56.840000 - 0:12:57.840000::Right.
0:12:57.840000 - 0:12:58.840000::I'm good.
0:12:58.840000 - 0:12:59.840000::Exactly.
0:12:59.840000 - 0:13:00.840000::Man.
0:13:00.840000 - 0:13:04.840000::Well, he should be going up to rich people who are financially
0:13:04.840000 - 0:13:05.840000::well to do.
0:13:05.840000 - 0:13:08.840000::You go up to them and say, hey, can I have five bucks for a burger?
0:13:08.840000 - 0:13:10.840000::I just literally found the best one.
0:13:10.840000 - 0:13:11.840000::And I'm fucking sorry.
0:13:11.840000 - 0:13:12.840000::And I need help and I have no legs.
0:13:12.840000 - 0:13:16.840000::And then he say, if they say yes, don't give them money.
0:13:16.840000 - 0:13:17.840000::Yeah.
0:13:17.840000 - 0:13:22.840000::I'll just say make out with them, but that's not right.
0:13:22.840000 - 0:13:23.840000::Getting their car.
0:13:23.840000 - 0:13:24.840000::No.
0:13:24.840000 - 0:13:28.840000::Don't give them money, but like, you know, bless an object on them.
0:13:28.840000 - 0:13:29.840000::You know what I'm saying?
0:13:29.840000 - 0:13:31.840000::You know, can I bless one of your objects real quick?
0:13:31.840000 - 0:13:32.840000::I just, that was a test.
0:13:32.840000 - 0:13:34.840000::I don't actually need five bucks, but let me say an ancient prayer
0:13:34.840000 - 0:13:37.840000::real quick on your car keys so that you will always have something special
0:13:37.840000 - 0:13:38.840000::on you.
0:13:38.840000 - 0:13:39.840000::What is that?
0:13:39.840000 - 0:13:41.840000::He was like, oh man.
0:13:41.840000 - 0:13:42.840000::Oh man.
0:13:42.840000 - 0:13:44.840000::The ancient prayers.
0:13:44.840000 - 0:13:48.840000::You know what, Jack, you would love speaking in tongues.
0:13:48.840000 - 0:13:50.840000::I think that's what I really would.
0:13:50.840000 - 0:13:52.840000::We got to go to a Pentecostal.
0:13:52.840000 - 0:13:55.840000::Next city we go to, we do the joy, Texas live.
0:13:55.840000 - 0:13:59.840000::We're starting that Sunday morning out with a Pentecostal experience.
0:13:59.840000 - 0:14:00.840000::Okay.
0:14:00.840000 - 0:14:05.840000::We're getting, we're getting some bloodies right before at a local bar.
0:14:05.840000 - 0:14:06.840000::Bloody Mary's.
0:14:06.840000 - 0:14:07.840000::We got 10 bloodies in us.
0:14:07.840000 - 0:14:09.840000::Go to the Pentecostal church.
0:14:09.840000 - 0:14:11.840000::Smell them like alcohol.
0:14:11.840000 - 0:14:12.840000::They're trying to bless us.
0:14:12.840000 - 0:14:14.840000::Get the fucking alcoholism out of us.
0:14:14.840000 - 0:14:15.840000::Smell like pickles.
0:14:15.840000 - 0:14:16.840000::You know how I like a bloody?
0:14:16.840000 - 0:14:19.840000::Let me get the fucking liquid up to, here's the cup.
0:14:19.840000 - 0:14:21.840000::Let me get the bloody Mary mix up to here.
0:14:21.840000 - 0:14:23.840000::Let me get the vodka up to here.
0:14:23.840000 - 0:14:25.840000::And then for the rest of that shit with sports peppers.
0:14:25.840000 - 0:14:26.840000::Snap.
0:14:26.840000 - 0:14:28.840000::25, four peppers.
0:14:28.840000 - 0:14:30.840000::What's a sports pepper?
0:14:30.840000 - 0:14:32.840000::A sport pepper.
0:14:32.840000 - 0:14:36.840000::Did you, did you live in Chicago?
0:14:36.840000 - 0:14:38.840000::Did you know what I'm saying?
0:14:38.840000 - 0:14:40.840000::Did you even live in Chicago?
0:14:40.840000 - 0:14:42.840000::Did you, did you eat oysters?
0:14:42.840000 - 0:14:44.840000::I literally have to die.
0:14:44.840000 - 0:14:49.840000::It's them green type of peppers that they put on Chicago style hot dogs, dude.
0:14:49.840000 - 0:14:50.840000::And they also,
0:14:50.840000 - 0:14:51.840000::All of them little things,
0:14:51.840000 - 0:14:52.840000::them little guys.
0:14:52.840000 - 0:14:53.840000::Yeah.
0:14:53.840000 - 0:14:56.840000::Mm, relative to some peppers, but.
0:14:56.840000 - 0:14:58.840000::Yeah, they got them in and out, birdie.
0:14:58.840000 - 0:14:59.840000::Okay.
0:14:59.840000 - 0:15:00.840000::Now, okay.

0:15:00 - 0:15:01.480000::Now you're a West Coast.
0:15:01.480000 - 0:15:04.440000::I don't like your energy on this podcast, Nate.
0:15:04.440000 - 0:15:06.200000::Well, I'm on a West Coast,
0:15:06.200000 - 0:15:08.400000::I'm a West Coast in the Midwest right now, dude.
0:15:08.400000 - 0:15:10.800000::This isn't the, this is a different type of vibe, man.
0:15:10.800000 - 0:15:13.040000::You're actually like a human wagyu right now.
0:15:13.040000 - 0:15:15::And that just means cow, right?
0:15:15 - 0:15:16.480000::Wagyu.
0:15:16.480000 - 0:15:18::I guess, yeah.
0:15:18 - 0:15:18.840000::Damn.
0:15:18.840000 - 0:15:21.880000::Oh, question for people, the cooks out there.
0:15:21.880000 - 0:15:23.560000::Yeah, the other thing I was sitting on

0:15:30.680000 - 0:15:34.120000::uh, asparagus, broccoli.
0:15:34.120000 - 0:15:35.120000::I love asparagus.
0:15:35.120000 - 0:15:37.120000::How fat are the asparagus?
0:15:37.120000 - 0:15:38.120000::Huh?
0:15:38.120000 - 0:15:39.120000::Diameter.
0:15:39.120000 - 0:15:40.640000::How much is the diameter of the asparagus?
0:15:40.640000 - 0:15:41.640000::Oh, they're thick.
0:15:41.640000 - 0:15:43.960000::Don't really worry about it, man.
0:15:43.960000 - 0:15:46.120000::They're thick stock.
0:15:46.120000 - 0:15:47.560000::How can they be so different?
0:15:47.560000 - 0:15:51.160000::Some asparagus are a fucking thinner than a pencil and some asparagus are thick.
0:15:51.160000 - 0:15:53.600000::Well, go to a American mall and look around.
0:15:53.600000 - 0:15:55.680000::What do you see?
0:15:55.680000 - 0:15:56.680000::Does everybody look the same?
0:15:56.680000 - 0:15:57.680000::I see.
0:15:57.680000 - 0:15:58.680000::I see.
0:15:58.680000 - 0:15:59.680000::I see.
0:15:59.680000 - 0:16:00.680000::I see.
0:16:00.680000 - 0:16:01.680000::But not for you.
0:16:01.680000 - 0:16:02.680000::I was just saying, yeah.
0:16:02.680000 - 0:16:03.680000::Okay.
0:16:03.680000 - 0:16:04.680000::My question is this.
0:16:04.680000 - 0:16:08.960000::I made the steak last night ribeye on a cast iron pan.
0:16:08.960000 - 0:16:11.440000::I'm trying to get into the cast iron of it all.
0:16:11.440000 - 0:16:25.480000::I was intimidated by the way that you clean it because you got to rub it out with paper
0:16:25.480000 - 0:16:28::towel and put oil on it, whatever.
0:16:28 - 0:16:30.280000::That seems foreign to me.
0:16:30.280000 - 0:16:32::But I've made it on the cast iron.
0:16:32 - 0:16:34.080000::Delicious steak off the charts.
0:16:34.080000 - 0:16:37.880000::Made me put the flaky salt on top.
0:16:37.880000 - 0:16:39.280000::Flake it on all on top.
0:16:39.280000 - 0:16:40.280000::You have to do that.
0:16:40.280000 - 0:16:44.520000::But the whole apartment is like a smoke den.
0:16:44.520000 - 0:16:45.760000::It's all smoked out.
0:16:45.760000 - 0:16:48.720000::The alarms are going out.
0:16:48.720000 - 0:16:50.720000::How do you get it to not be so smoky?
0:16:50.720000 - 0:16:52.840000::Or is there just no?
0:16:52.840000 - 0:16:53.840000::That's just how it is.
0:16:53.840000 - 0:16:54.840000::Meek.
0:16:54.840000 - 0:17:01.120000::I know Jack is going to have an amazing solution to this.
0:17:01.120000 - 0:17:02.960000::And you don't even need to ask the chefs.
0:17:02.960000 - 0:17:06.640000::What you need to ask is somebody who has no culinary experience.
0:17:06.640000 - 0:17:10.560000::Someone that takes outside the box because they never even seen the box.
0:17:10.560000 - 0:17:11.560000::Exactly.
0:17:11.560000 - 0:17:12.560000::Exactly.
0:17:12.560000 - 0:17:14.560000::So Jack.
0:17:14.560000 - 0:17:19.600000::Jack, you're cooking a cast iron pan.
0:17:19.600000 - 0:17:20.840000::There's smoke everywhere.
0:17:20.840000 - 0:17:23.120000::How are we going to contain this smoke?
0:17:23.120000 - 0:17:28.120000::Now a chef, they're thinking, oh, I'm going to put a fan up top crack a window.
0:17:28.120000 - 0:17:29.120000::Did that?
0:17:29.120000 - 0:17:31.440000::How did a fan go on right at the damn smoke detection?
0:17:31.440000 - 0:17:32.440000::And that didn't work.
0:17:32.440000 - 0:17:33.440000::All right.
0:17:33.440000 - 0:17:37.160000::Because if it did, you wouldn't be on this fucking podcast talking about this shit asking
0:17:37.160000 - 0:17:38.840000::these people this shit, would you?
0:17:38.840000 - 0:17:39.840000::Right.
0:17:39.840000 - 0:17:40.840000::Right.
0:17:40.840000 - 0:17:45.560000::I'm afraid of the ones inside the box.
0:17:45.560000 - 0:17:47.120000::I literally can't see right now.
0:17:47.120000 - 0:17:51.560000::I'm staring into a blurry laptop screen right now with some.
0:17:51.560000 - 0:17:55.800000::Well, your facial hair looks amazing.
0:17:55.800000 - 0:17:56.800000::Thank you.
0:17:56.800000 - 0:17:57.800000::Of course.
0:17:57.800000 - 0:18:00.520000::So here you go.
0:18:00.520000 - 0:18:01.520000::Here you go.
0:18:01.520000 - 0:18:08.240000::What a contemporary human might say is, you know, try putting more oil on the steak.
0:18:08.240000 - 0:18:09.240000::Right.
0:18:09.240000 - 0:18:10.240000::Right.
0:18:10.240000 - 0:18:12.360000::Give it something good, whatever.
0:18:12.360000 - 0:18:16.680000::Now what people don't realize is how good smoke is.
0:18:16.680000 - 0:18:17.680000::Right.
0:18:17.680000 - 0:18:18.680000::Oh, it tastes smoky.
0:18:18.680000 - 0:18:19.680000::Oh, it's this.
0:18:19.680000 - 0:18:22.240000::Smoke is not something you want to get rid of, right?
0:18:22.240000 - 0:18:25.480000::It's actually something you want to harness and infuse.
0:18:25.480000 - 0:18:29.520000::So what I would say is why not make it extra smoky?
0:18:29.520000 - 0:18:32.160000::No oil as little liquid in the pan as possible.
0:18:32.160000 - 0:18:34.040000::Let that shit cook.
0:18:34.040000 - 0:18:35.520000::Have a little straw.
0:18:35.520000 - 0:18:41.600000::And I'm not, you don't suck it, but get a sucking machine that sucks the smoke and puts
0:18:41.600000 - 0:18:49.640000::it into a vat of canola oil so that you can make smokey canola oil.
0:18:50.640000 - 0:18:53.520000::And drop it into other products.
0:18:53.520000 - 0:18:58.600000::So now you're not going to be steak less smoky.
0:18:58.600000 - 0:19:02.480000::And you could drop it in some goota later on in your life.
0:19:02.480000 - 0:19:03.480000::Wow.
0:19:03.480000 - 0:19:05::Liquid smoke.
0:19:05 - 0:19:08.960000::Smoke capturing liquid smoke essence machine.
0:19:08.960000 - 0:19:11.240000::You know what I could use at a little tent?
0:19:11.240000 - 0:19:13.320000::Put my CPAP in there.
0:19:13.320000 - 0:19:18.080000::Have the CPAP tube vented out the window.
0:19:18.080000 - 0:19:19.080000::It's no problem.
0:19:19.080000 - 0:19:22.240000::And then when you're breathing, when you're going to sleep, it's like I'm going to stay
0:19:22.240000 - 0:19:23.240000::out.
0:19:23.240000 - 0:19:24.240000::That's right.
0:19:24.240000 - 0:19:25.240000::That's right.
0:19:25.240000 - 0:19:27.480000::Oh, they don't make flavored CPAPs yet.
0:19:27.480000 - 0:19:28.480000::Do that.
0:19:28.480000 - 0:19:31.280000::I mean, not officially because they have.
0:19:31.280000 - 0:19:35.760000::Well, I've already I've lined a bunch of major league chew in the tube.
0:19:35.760000 - 0:19:40.320000::So it's more like bubble gum on my head.
0:19:40.320000 - 0:19:43.560000::That's good.
0:19:43.560000 - 0:19:44.560000::That's good.
0:19:44.560000 - 0:19:48.160000::Well, we saw what I had.
0:19:48.160000 - 0:19:49.160000::Yeah.
0:19:49.160000 - 0:19:52.120000::You get the chicken wings.
0:19:52.120000 - 0:19:54.640000::No, are the chicken wings incredible there?
0:19:54.640000 - 0:19:55.640000::I enjoy them.
0:19:55.640000 - 0:19:56.640000::Yeah.
0:19:56.640000 - 0:19:57.640000::Okay.
0:19:57.640000 - 0:19:59.960000::We had Jets pizza about a month ago.

0:20:00 - 0:20:01::Jack at Sarah's house.
0:20:01 - 0:20:02.800000::Remember that you ordered it.
0:20:02.800000 - 0:20:07::And I'm rocking with jets so hard, but for some reason that was the most flavorless jets
0:20:07 - 0:20:09::ever tasted.
0:20:09 - 0:20:10::What did you get on that?
0:20:10 - 0:20:14.520000::Did they have a jardin era at this jet state?
0:20:14.520000 - 0:20:17.680000::We didn't get it, but steak.
0:20:17.680000 - 0:20:18.680000::That's a steak.
0:20:18.680000 - 0:20:19.680000::Yeah.
0:20:19.680000 - 0:20:20.680000::What did you get on it?
0:20:20.680000 - 0:20:21.680000::It was really good.
0:20:21.680000 - 0:20:26.600000::We got half mushroom and half sausage.
0:20:26.600000 - 0:20:27.720000::My mom ordered it.
0:20:27.720000 - 0:20:28.720000::So she was.
0:20:28.720000 - 0:20:29.720000::Okay.
0:20:29.720000 - 0:20:30.880000::We got the ranch on the side.
0:20:30.880000 - 0:20:32.560000::They have the best ranch on the planet.
0:20:32.560000 - 0:20:33.560000::And you know what I was thinking?
0:20:33.560000 - 0:20:36::It's making my mouth water right now, not even canned bananas.
0:20:36 - 0:20:37.480000::And bananas on the side.
0:20:37.480000 - 0:20:39.320000::Oh, that's what you fucking need.
0:20:39.320000 - 0:20:40.320000::Mmm.
0:20:40.320000 - 0:20:41.320000::Oh, shit.
0:20:41.320000 - 0:20:42.320000::Pizza.
0:20:42.320000 - 0:20:43.320000::But.
0:20:43.320000 - 0:20:44.320000::Pizza, pizza.
0:20:44.320000 - 0:20:47.920000::You know that little, the mascot, the jets, pizza mascot.
0:20:47.920000 - 0:20:50.880000::Oh, that little crazy ass guy that's wearing the jet pack.
0:20:50.880000 - 0:20:52.200000::That little psycho.
0:20:52.200000 - 0:20:53.200000::Yeah.
0:20:53.200000 - 0:20:54.200000::You know how?
0:20:54.200000 - 0:20:55.200000::He passed away.
0:20:55.200000 - 0:20:56.200000::He passed away.
0:20:56.200000 - 0:20:57.200000::He passed away.
0:20:57.200000 - 0:20:58.200000::I have no tattoos on my body.
0:20:58.200000 - 0:20:59.520000::You want to get that?
0:20:59.520000 - 0:21:02.320000::I had the urge to like, this would make a great tattoo.
0:21:02.320000 - 0:21:07.720000::So if somebody out there is just like fucking head to toe tattooed up and it doesn't matter
0:21:07.720000 - 0:21:12.920000::to get like another fucking tattoo on your, you know, the cap or whatever, get that jets,
0:21:12.920000 - 0:21:14.520000::pizza, fucking guy.
0:21:14.520000 - 0:21:17.880000::Cause I feel like that would be just such a great tattoo.
0:21:17.880000 - 0:21:19.880000::Immortalize him.
0:21:19.880000 - 0:21:23.080000::That would be fucking sick.
0:21:23.080000 - 0:21:24.080000::Yeah.
0:21:24.080000 - 0:21:28.360000::Or maybe actually the Midwest has the most amazing pizza characters to trope.
0:21:28.360000 - 0:21:34.080000::Little Caesar's kind of a home of pizza that no one's starring with little Caesars.
0:21:34.080000 - 0:21:35.080000::Marcos pizza.
0:21:35.080000 - 0:21:36.080000::You're heard of that.
0:21:36.080000 - 0:21:37.080000::No.
0:21:37.080000 - 0:21:38.080000::Yep.
0:21:38.080000 - 0:21:39.080000::That's pretty much.
0:21:39.080000 - 0:21:43.920000::Oh, remember beggars pizza from Chicago?
0:21:43.920000 - 0:21:44.920000::No.
0:21:44.920000 - 0:21:45.920000::Barely.
0:21:45.920000 - 0:21:46.920000::Okay.
0:21:46.920000 - 0:21:47.920000::Barely.
0:21:47.920000 - 0:21:48.920000::Well, that's just brand.
0:21:48.920000 - 0:21:49.920000::That's all right.
0:21:49.920000 - 0:21:56.320000::Nate, what would it take to get you to get a liquid A2 tattoo or something?
0:21:56.320000 - 0:22:01.640000::If you were with Travis Barker snorting on some ancient drug that's purple and glowing
0:22:01.640000 - 0:22:05.480000::up in the sky, up in a private jet.
0:22:05.480000 - 0:22:07.160000::And he says, yeah, I got the tattoo artist with me.
0:22:07.160000 - 0:22:10.160000::I'm about to get another fucking whatever line on my neck.
0:22:10.160000 - 0:22:11.160000::Yeah.
0:22:11.160000 - 0:22:12.680000::What's your, what was that guy's name?
0:22:12.680000 - 0:22:14.160000::DJ Aaron or something?
0:22:14.160000 - 0:22:15.160000::DJ.
0:22:15.160000 - 0:22:16.160000::DJ.
0:22:16.160000 - 0:22:17.160000::DJ.
0:22:17.160000 - 0:22:19.160000::You got to get DJ.
0:22:19.160000 - 0:22:21.160000::And I'm on your tummy.
0:22:21.160000 - 0:22:22.160000::Nate.
0:22:22.160000 - 0:22:23.160000::Just the just.
0:22:23.160000 - 0:22:24.160000::Oh, wow.
0:22:24.160000 - 0:22:25.880000::Photo realistic picture of DJ.
0:22:25.880000 - 0:22:26.880000::Yeah.
0:22:26.880000 - 0:22:27.880000::I'm on your tummy.
0:22:27.880000 - 0:22:29.200000::I'm saying black and white.
0:22:29.200000 - 0:22:30.200000::Chester Bennett.
0:22:30.200000 - 0:22:31.200000::I'll get it.
0:22:31.200000 - 0:22:34.680000::Would you guys get a joy tactics tattoo?
0:22:34.680000 - 0:22:37.800000::You know, yeah, if it, yeah, I probably would.
0:22:37.800000 - 0:22:40::On the ass.
0:22:40 - 0:22:42.920000::You know, the ass should be reserved for cursive.
0:22:42.920000 - 0:22:44.800000::You know what I'm saying?
0:22:44.800000 - 0:22:48.640000::I want a little bit of cursive on me.
0:22:48.640000 - 0:22:49.640000::You know what I'm saying?
0:22:49.640000 - 0:22:52.080000::Eric, we look like little swimmers with these hats on.
0:22:52.080000 - 0:22:53.080000::Yes.
0:22:53.080000 - 0:22:55.080000::I'm just keeping, sorry.
0:22:55.080000 - 0:22:56.080000::Yeah.
0:22:56.080000 - 0:22:57.080000::Kind of special ops.
0:22:57.080000 - 0:22:58.080000::Swimmers.
0:22:58.080000 - 0:22:59.080000::The frog.
0:22:59.080000 - 0:23:01.080000::The frog, man.
0:23:01.080000 - 0:23:05.080000::Imagine seeing this guy come up all silent in the water.
0:23:05.080000 - 0:23:06.080000::Oh, dude.
0:23:06.080000 - 0:23:09.080000::You're playing with a ball on the beach, you know, with your friends.
0:23:09.080000 - 0:23:12.440000::And he just puts his finger to his mat like this.
0:23:12.440000 - 0:23:13.440000::Shhh.
0:23:13.440000 - 0:23:14.440000::With the knee.
0:23:14.440000 - 0:23:15.440000::And a t-shirt.
0:23:15.440000 - 0:23:16.440000::Just all wet.
0:23:16.440000 - 0:23:17.440000::Completely wet.
0:23:17.440000 - 0:23:18.440000::He's a little overweight.
0:23:18.440000 - 0:23:19.440000::No problem.
0:23:19.440000 - 0:23:20.440000::He's unsuspected.
0:23:20.440000 - 0:23:24.840000::And then he goes and assassinates all of the terrorist leaders in your town.
0:23:24.840000 - 0:23:27.360000::Can you imagine?
0:23:27.360000 - 0:23:28.360000::Imagine this.
0:23:28.360000 - 0:23:31.040000::Just imagine seeing the guy get out of the water like this.
0:23:31.040000 - 0:23:32.040000::Shhh.
0:23:32.040000 - 0:23:33.040000::With a gun.
0:23:33.040000 - 0:23:34.040000::Shhh.
0:23:34.040000 - 0:23:35.040000::He's silent.
0:23:35.040000 - 0:23:36.040000::I'd be preaching.
0:23:36.040000 - 0:23:38.440000::That is a movie that needs to be made.
0:23:38.440000 - 0:23:40.160000::Could you imagine this?
0:23:40.160000 - 0:23:41.160000::What's that?
0:23:41.160000 - 0:23:44.840000::Me coming out the, coming out the water same scenario.
0:23:44.840000 - 0:23:45.840000::Okay.
0:23:45.840000 - 0:23:49.840000::And I have a silencer rock.
0:23:49.840000 - 0:23:53.840000::I have a silencer pistol.
0:23:53.840000 - 0:23:56.840000::And it looks like a silencer.
0:23:56.840000 - 0:24:04.840000::So when I shoot it, it's like the loudest stuff in the entire beach.
0:24:04.840000 - 0:24:08.840000::You're talking about the loud miser.
0:24:08.840000 - 0:24:10.840000::And then I'm saying the amplifier.
0:24:10.840000 - 0:24:11.840000::Most people get the silencer.
0:24:11.840000 - 0:24:12.840000::I'm not afraid.
0:24:12.840000 - 0:24:13.840000::I want people to know.
0:24:13.840000 - 0:24:14.840000::That's a good idea.
0:24:14.840000 - 0:24:15.840000::I'm not afraid.
0:24:15.840000 - 0:24:16.840000::I want people to know.
0:24:16.840000 - 0:24:17.840000::That's a good idea.
0:24:18.840000 - 0:24:20.840000::Damn, that's a good ass product.
0:24:20.840000 - 0:24:21.840000::The joy tactics.
0:24:21.840000 - 0:24:22.840000::Oh my god.
0:24:22.840000 - 0:24:23.840000::The loud silence.
0:24:23.840000 - 0:24:24.840000::The gun loud in there.
0:24:24.840000 - 0:24:26.840000::Shhh.
0:24:26.840000 - 0:24:29.840000::That is amazing.
0:24:29.840000 - 0:24:30.840000::Oh.
0:24:30.840000 - 0:24:32.840000::Got a Thera gun.
0:24:32.840000 - 0:24:34.840000::Right.
0:24:34.840000 - 0:24:36.840000::Did you just say this on the last episode?
0:24:36.840000 - 0:24:38.840000::Did I say it?
0:24:38.840000 - 0:24:39.840000::I don't know.
0:24:39.840000 - 0:24:41.840000::You definitely told us.
0:24:41.840000 - 0:24:42.840000::Yeah.
0:24:42.840000 - 0:24:43.840000::I don't know.
0:24:43.840000 - 0:24:44.840000::I think that was reserved.
0:24:44.840000 - 0:24:45.840000::That was off the pod topic.
0:24:45.840000 - 0:24:46.840000::Oh yeah.
0:24:46.840000 - 0:24:48.840000::I think I got it as a gift for someone.
0:24:48.840000 - 0:24:49.840000::I want to say who but someone special.
0:24:49.840000 - 0:24:50.840000::And they didn't.
0:24:50.840000 - 0:24:52.840000::They said, no thanks.
0:24:52.840000 - 0:24:53.840000::You know, they wanted us to know.
0:24:53.840000 - 0:24:55.840000::So I got to keep it.
0:24:55.840000 - 0:24:56.840000::Damn, no thanks.

0:25:00 - 0:25:00.840000::I'm not back.
0:25:00.840000 - 0:25:03.240000::She didn't say no thanks, but can you imagine just like open
0:25:03.240000 - 0:25:05.840000::up the fucking no thanks next?
0:25:05.840000 - 0:25:07.360000::Oh, no thanks.

0:25:12.360000 - 0:25:14.200000::I've been holding on to you guys.
0:25:15.440000 - 0:25:17.160000::Oh, you got a string.
0:25:17.160000 - 0:25:19.320000::Shutty a little baddy.
0:25:19.320000 - 0:25:22.640000::Oh, you can need to go to a high school and ask.
0:25:22.640000 - 0:25:24.680000::Not a high school stay away from them.
0:25:24.680000 - 0:25:27.840000::Go to a college and say who's the,
0:25:27.840000 - 0:25:29.920000::who do you think the finest person at school is?
0:25:29.920000 - 0:25:32.880000::Yeah, yo, how would you rate yourself?
0:25:32.880000 - 0:25:34.120000::Raise your cell line to school one or 10.
0:25:34.120000 - 0:25:35.160000::How would you rate this person?
0:25:35.160000 - 0:25:38.720000::Um, probably actually a six.
0:25:38.720000 - 0:25:40.240000::Okay, bet.
0:25:40.240000 - 0:25:42.720000::Yo, how would you rate this person one or 10?
0:25:42.720000 - 0:25:46.120000::Oh, oh, oh.
0:25:49.120000 - 0:25:50.560000::Probably a six.
0:25:50.560000 - 0:25:53.360000::Well, what's that, Eric?
0:25:53.360000 - 0:25:55.400000::That's the noise of being into somebody.
0:25:55.400000 - 0:25:58.200000::That's the noise of just being initially kind of
0:25:58.200000 - 0:26:03.200000::taken aback by their appearance and then coming around to the fact that they're not that ugly.
0:26:03.200000 - 0:26:05.400000::And actually there are six.
0:26:05.400000 - 0:26:07.560000::This podcast is so different this year.
0:26:07.560000 - 0:26:08.400000::Why?
0:26:08.400000 - 0:26:09.400000::I know.
0:26:09.400000 - 0:26:11.320000::Well, I think we're tired of the same old,
0:26:11.320000 - 0:26:13.680000::you know that joy tactics, bingo went out.
0:26:13.680000 - 0:26:14.520000::Right.
0:26:14.520000 - 0:26:16.640000::And I just said enough enough.
0:26:16.640000 - 0:26:22.360000::Like I don't want anybody to be able to put me into a pattern, put me into a box like that.
0:26:22.360000 - 0:26:23.200000::Right.
0:26:23.200000 - 0:26:27.480000::So let me add a little more real, like my real self and stop being so fake.
0:26:27.480000 - 0:26:30.120000::I've been holding that on something too.
0:26:30.120000 - 0:26:34.080000::Let's see, there's one thing in this frame that fell on my head last night.
0:26:34.080000 - 0:26:35.080000::What is it?
0:26:35.080000 - 0:26:37.840000::Is it that white rectangle?
0:26:37.840000 - 0:26:39.240000::It is.
0:26:39.240000 - 0:26:40.440000::Crown.
0:26:40.440000 - 0:26:41.840000::Right there.
0:26:41.840000 - 0:26:46.440000::I'm in a hotel and I have a lawsuit incoming quickly and rapidly.
0:26:46.440000 - 0:26:51.040000::Because this thing I was trying to close the blind so that nobody could fucking peep on me.
0:26:51.040000 - 0:26:54.120000::Well, I'm sleeping.
0:26:54.120000 - 0:26:55.960000::Fell on my head, man.
0:26:55.960000 - 0:26:56.960000::Are you kidding me?
0:26:56.960000 - 0:27:01.320000::That thing actually is very heavy and it was actually shocking.
0:27:01.320000 - 0:27:04.880000::You need what hotel changes this?
0:27:04.880000 - 0:27:07.960000::I don't want to go off on this, but it's probably a holiday.
0:27:07.960000 - 0:27:11.320000::It's a holiday holiday.
0:27:11.320000 - 0:27:14.320000::Is it weird that I don't know what hotel I'm in right now?
0:27:14.320000 - 0:27:18.280000::No, because you're on the road so much road dog in it that yeah, hotels start to look
0:27:18.280000 - 0:27:19.280000::pretty similar.
0:27:19.280000 - 0:27:20.280000::I get it.
0:27:20.280000 - 0:27:21.280000::Yeah.
0:27:21.280000 - 0:27:22.480000::Well, I'm going to fucking help it.
0:27:22.480000 - 0:27:26.240000::And there's one of the most disappointing signs in the world on the elevator by the way.
0:27:26.240000 - 0:27:32.320000::It says this, just so you know everybody, starting January 1st, the pool and the jacuzzi
0:27:32.320000 - 0:27:34.440000::will be closed indefinitely.
0:27:34.440000 - 0:27:35.960000::From January 6th.
0:27:35.960000 - 0:27:36.960000::What did I say?
0:27:36.960000 - 0:27:37.960000::Is that what I said?
0:27:37.960000 - 0:27:38.960000::No, January 1st.
0:27:38.960000 - 0:27:39.960000::Did I say 6?
0:27:39.960000 - 0:27:43.960000::I thought you said 6.
0:27:43.960000 - 0:27:48.440000::Well, there's no way to know.
0:27:48.440000 - 0:27:51.240000::I just hate to see a hotel without a fucking pool.
0:27:51.240000 - 0:27:54.320000::Just listen, it's not for the adults, it's for the fucking kids.
0:27:54.320000 - 0:27:57.160000::It's for the kids, right?
0:27:57.160000 - 0:27:58.840000::Hotels should be a place of magic.
0:27:58.840000 - 0:28:01.360000::You go walk in and there's somebody standing there.
0:28:01.360000 - 0:28:02.360000::Hello.
0:28:02.360000 - 0:28:05.360000::They've got a name tag with a name you've never seen in your fucking life.
0:28:05.360000 - 0:28:07.360000::Closetina, you know what I'm saying?
0:28:07.360000 - 0:28:08.360000::Closetina.
0:28:08.360000 - 0:28:12.200000::Closetina or something else.
0:28:12.200000 - 0:28:13.600000::And they've got food.
0:28:13.600000 - 0:28:17.040000::It's basically a 24 hour convenience store.
0:28:17.040000 - 0:28:18.040000::A backpack.
0:28:18.040000 - 0:28:19.320000::Oh, all the stores are closed.
0:28:19.320000 - 0:28:22.400000::Go to the hotel and get yourself a bag of M&Ms and a bag of Pringles.
0:28:22.400000 - 0:28:23.600000::Those are easy to steal from.
0:28:23.600000 - 0:28:26.400000::Not that I ever would, I don't have the courage.
0:28:26.400000 - 0:28:29.560000::Well, I don't find anything easy to steal from.
0:28:29.560000 - 0:28:32.160000::And I'm sorry, I just ate one of the best candies.
0:28:32.160000 - 0:28:33.960000::I shouldn't be eating.
0:28:33.960000 - 0:28:37.960000::Someone called me out for popping the Ricola on a recent podcast.
0:28:37.960000 - 0:28:41.320000::It disgusted their ears, you know, hearing someone suck on something.
0:28:41.320000 - 0:28:43.440000::My ears are full right now, left.
0:28:43.440000 - 0:28:45.280000::But I just had an amazing candy.
0:28:45.520000 - 0:28:46.280000::What's it called?
0:28:46.280000 - 0:28:47.280000::What's it flavored?
0:28:47.280000 - 0:28:50.280000::Lea Anista Flavik.
0:28:50.280000 - 0:28:52.280000::Flavik, excuse me.
0:28:52.280000 - 0:28:53.280000::Likers Flavik.
0:28:53.280000 - 0:28:54.280000::Oh, yeah.
0:28:54.280000 - 0:28:56.280000::The old-timey style candies.
0:28:56.280000 - 0:28:58.280000::I'm gonna tell you right now, Eric.
0:28:58.280000 - 0:28:59.280000::What?
0:28:59.280000 - 0:29:00.280000::Stop eating that.
0:29:00.280000 - 0:29:03.160000::I chewed it already and I chewed it away from the mic all politely.
0:29:03.160000 - 0:29:05.160000::Is it black Likers Flavik?
0:29:05.160000 - 0:29:06.160000::White.
0:29:06.160000 - 0:29:09.120000::It's colored white and it is black Likers Flavik, yeah.
0:29:09.120000 - 0:29:12.360000::Well, stay away from that shit because that shit will give you aortic defibrillation.
0:29:12.360000 - 0:29:13.360000::Oh.
0:29:13.360000 - 0:29:15.200000::Are you serious?
0:29:15.200000 - 0:29:17.200000::That's not the right disease.
0:29:17.200000 - 0:29:20.200000::I heard it keeps you high blood pressure.
0:29:20.200000 - 0:29:24.200000::Well, that's one of the things, that's one of the mildest things that it does to you.
0:29:24.200000 - 0:29:28.440000::But black Likers, which will be the death of me because it's my favorite candy, it kills
0:29:28.440000 - 0:29:29.440000::you.
0:29:29.440000 - 0:29:30.440000::Are you serious?
0:29:30.440000 - 0:29:31.440000::Are you serious?
0:29:31.440000 - 0:29:32.440000::Are you serious?
0:29:32.440000 - 0:29:33.440000::Are you serious?
0:29:33.440000 - 0:29:34.440000::A rare heart disease.
0:29:34.440000 - 0:29:35.440000::My love.
0:29:35.440000 - 0:29:36.440000::Which everybody in my family has.
0:29:36.440000 - 0:29:37.440000::Except for me, I'm the last passion of home.
0:29:37.440000 - 0:29:40.480000::So the Dutch need to get it straight and throw all those salty Likers.
0:29:40.480000 - 0:29:42.680000::Who are the Dutch?
0:29:42.680000 - 0:29:43.680000::No wait, Nate.
0:29:43.680000 - 0:29:45.280000::I want you to answer this.
0:29:45.280000 - 0:29:46.280000::The Dutch?
0:29:46.280000 - 0:29:47.280000::Who are you being?
0:29:47.280000 - 0:29:48.280000::Who are the Dutch?
0:29:48.280000 - 0:29:49.280000::Who are they?
0:29:49.280000 - 0:29:50.280000::Where are you from?
0:29:50.280000 - 0:29:51.280000::Where are you from?
0:29:51.280000 - 0:29:52.280000::You think you're Dutch?
0:29:52.280000 - 0:29:53.280000::Yeah, where are the Dutch?
0:29:53.280000 - 0:29:54.280000::I'm not delaying right now.
0:29:54.280000 - 0:29:55.280000::I'm not delaying right now.
0:29:55.280000 - 0:29:57.280000::The thing is, you think I'm delaying right now?
0:29:57.280000 - 0:29:59.720000::Just trying to shit the other in my head.

0:30:00 - 0:30:01.280000::But I'm actually not.
0:30:02.880000 - 0:30:04.160000::So what was the question again?
0:30:04.800000 - 0:30:06.720000::What country are Dutch people from?
0:30:06.720000 - 0:30:08.480000::Okay, yeah, that's what I thought you said.
0:30:11.120000 - 0:30:12.480000::Again, I'm just not...
0:30:12.480000 - 0:30:13.680000::There's no point.
0:30:13.680000 - 0:30:16.400000::There would be no reason why I would delay this.
0:30:16.400000 - 0:30:18.880000::I don't think it's just such an easy lot.
0:30:18.880000 - 0:30:19.760000::It's just a...
0:30:19.760000 - 0:30:20.880000::It's just too easy, right?
0:30:20.880000 - 0:30:22.240000::I'm saying three, two, one.
0:30:22.240000 - 0:30:23.360000::Ames to damn.
0:30:26.080000 - 0:30:27.520000::I don't think that's a country, brother.
0:30:27.520000 - 0:30:28.320000::Country man.
0:30:28.800000 - 0:30:30.880000::The Dutch is...
0:30:30.880000 - 0:30:31.840000::Hold up.
0:30:31.840000 - 0:30:35.680000::I literally have this.
0:30:35.680000 - 0:30:37.840000::I'll tell you what, I don't know.
0:30:37.840000 - 0:30:39.120000::That's why I asked you.
0:30:39.120000 - 0:30:40.320000::That makes me feel better.
0:30:40.320000 - 0:30:43.040000::I have a strong guess of this very...
0:30:43.040000 - 0:30:44.240000::The Dutch Empire.
0:30:44.240000 - 0:30:45.200000::Let's talk it out.
0:30:45.200000 - 0:30:46.480000::Empire.
0:30:46.480000 - 0:30:53.600000::Well, the Dutch classically are from...
0:30:53.600000 - 0:30:55.040000::We know what area they're in.
0:30:55.040000 - 0:30:55.840000::Exactly.
0:30:55.840000 - 0:30:56.800000::It's in the Belgian...
0:30:56.800000 - 0:30:58::It looks like Netherlands type.
0:30:58.240000 - 0:30:59.920000::I think it's Denmark.
0:30:59.920000 - 0:31:01.280000::Okay.
0:31:01.280000 - 0:31:02.160000::No, it's not.
0:31:04.160000 - 0:31:05.200000::It can't be Denmark.
0:31:05.200000 - 0:31:06.080000::It's a confident...
0:31:06.080000 - 0:31:08.400000::What would you call a Denmark person?
0:31:08.400000 - 0:31:09.040000::Danish.
0:31:09.040000 - 0:31:11.440000::The Dutch land is Germany.
0:31:11.440000 - 0:31:13.280000::That's why I thought it might be German.
0:31:13.280000 - 0:31:14.880000::No, a Dutch is not German.
0:31:14.880000 - 0:31:15.840000::Gelgem.
0:31:15.840000 - 0:31:16.880000::Germany.
0:31:16.880000 - 0:31:17.360000::Brussels.
0:31:17.360000 - 0:31:20.240000::You're not calling anyone Denmarkian.
0:31:20.240000 - 0:31:21.680000::Danish.
0:31:21.680000 - 0:31:22.240000::The pastry.
0:31:22.240000 - 0:31:23.120000::Is that hot?
0:31:23.120000 - 0:31:24.720000::What country is Amsterdam in?
0:31:26 - 0:31:27.120000::Denmark.
0:31:28.080000 - 0:31:28.640000::Denmark?
0:31:28.640000 - 0:31:30.240000::No, it's definitely not.
0:31:30.240000 - 0:31:31.520000::I've been to Amsterdam.
0:31:31.520000 - 0:31:32.320000::It's in...
0:31:35.360000 - 0:31:36.560000::It's in Denmark.
0:31:36.560000 - 0:31:37.760000::It's in Amsterdam.
0:31:38.720000 - 0:31:40.400000::Amsterdam is not in Denmark.
0:31:41.680000 - 0:31:42.880000::It's definitely not in Denmark.
0:31:42.880000 - 0:31:43.920000::Oh, okay.
0:31:43.920000 - 0:31:44.880000::You know what?
0:31:44.880000 - 0:31:45.520000::It's been...
0:31:45.520000 - 0:31:46.560000::We're so close guys.
0:31:46.560000 - 0:31:47.760000::You tell me I wasn't in Denmark.
0:31:47.760000 - 0:31:49.440000::Denmark don't point in my life.
0:31:49.440000 - 0:31:50.640000::I know what it is.
0:31:50.640000 - 0:31:51.440000::It's Amsterdam.
0:31:51.440000 - 0:31:51.920000::Hold on.
0:31:51.920000 - 0:31:53.360000::Don't tell me.
0:31:53.360000 - 0:31:54.480000::Don't fucking tell me.
0:31:54.480000 - 0:31:55.280000::I know this.
0:31:55.280000 - 0:31:55.680000::I know this.
0:31:55.680000 - 0:31:56.960000::Germany, Brussels.
0:31:57.040000 - 0:31:59.120000::It's for some reason I'm getting an H in my head,
0:31:59.120000 - 0:32:00.880000::like Holland or something like that.
0:32:00.880000 - 0:32:01.600000::Or...
0:32:01.600000 - 0:32:02.640000::Am I close?
0:32:02.640000 - 0:32:03.920000::That's not a country.
0:32:03.920000 - 0:32:04.560000::That's Germany.
0:32:05.360000 - 0:32:06.800000::The Dutch Empire.
0:32:06.800000 - 0:32:08.320000::Holland tunnel, New York, shout out.
0:32:08.320000 - 0:32:11.360000::This is a country that you were not thinking about that often.
0:32:11.360000 - 0:32:12::I'll just...
0:32:12 - 0:32:12.560000::Dutch land.
0:32:12.560000 - 0:32:14.160000::Amsterdam, Denmark.
0:32:14.160000 - 0:32:15.520000::It's the country that's open to that.
0:32:15.520000 - 0:32:16.720000::Amsterdam's in, right?
0:32:16.720000 - 0:32:17.760000::What country is that, mate?
0:32:17.760000 - 0:32:18.480000::I got that for you.
0:32:18.480000 - 0:32:19.040000::Exactly.
0:32:19.040000 - 0:32:20.320000::So I was right pretty much.
0:32:20.320000 - 0:32:20.960000::It's Denmark.
0:32:20.960000 - 0:32:21.920000::Because it's...
0:32:21.920000 - 0:32:23.200000::It's not Netherlands.
0:32:23.200000 - 0:32:24::Then the fucking...
0:32:24 - 0:32:24.960000::The Netherlands are the fucking...
0:32:24.960000 - 0:32:26::Are you kidding me?
0:32:27.920000 - 0:32:29.280000::The fucking Netherlands.
0:32:29.280000 - 0:32:30::Yeah.
0:32:30 - 0:32:31.760000::They're going to be playing this in the...
0:32:31.760000 - 0:32:32.560000::Good God.
0:32:32.560000 - 0:32:34::It's for the new administration
0:32:34 - 0:32:35.600000::when they're figuring out the education program.
0:32:35.600000 - 0:32:36.240000::You know what I'm saying?
0:32:38 - 0:32:39.520000::Like just shaking their heads.
0:32:39.520000 - 0:32:41.280000::That might be one of the top...
0:32:42.480000 - 0:32:43.760000::Most fastest fucking...
0:32:43.760000 - 0:32:45.040000::Well, I'll tell you what.
0:32:45.040000 - 0:32:47.360000::When we do this podcast in 2025,
0:32:47.360000 - 0:32:47.920000::guess what?
0:32:47.920000 - 0:32:50.240000::I'm going to be reading a bunch of history books
0:32:50.240000 - 0:32:52.320000::and I'm going to be studying up.
0:32:52.320000 - 0:32:53.600000::And this is going to...
0:32:53.600000 - 0:32:55.120000::Something like this will never,
0:32:55.120000 - 0:32:56.400000::ever even happen again.
0:32:56.400000 - 0:32:57.760000::I know how entertaining this is
0:32:57.760000 - 0:32:58.720000::for you guys to think.
0:32:58.720000 - 0:32:59.920000::Oh, this is so hilarious.
0:32:59.920000 - 0:33:00.640000::How dumb they are.
0:33:01.280000 - 0:33:01.760000::Guess what?
0:33:01.760000 - 0:33:03.680000::We're not going to be in any more laughs like that
0:33:03.680000 - 0:33:04.480000::even though I'm in your...
0:33:04.480000 - 0:33:05.520000::Yes, yes, that's right.
0:33:05.520000 - 0:33:06.240000::That's right.
0:33:06.240000 - 0:33:08.640000::Oh, it's going to be no laugh for this year.
0:33:08.640000 - 0:33:09.920000::It's going to be serious thought.
0:33:09.920000 - 0:33:10.640000::It's going to be serious thought.
0:33:10.640000 - 0:33:12.640000::Pause's moments of reflection,
0:33:12.640000 - 0:33:13.920000::critical thinking.
0:33:13.920000 - 0:33:16.400000::And prevent what this new year is all about.
0:33:16.720000 - 0:33:17.440000::And man,
0:33:17.440000 - 0:33:18.880000::Shout out to the Netherlands.
0:33:18.880000 - 0:33:20.080000::That's probably the only country
0:33:20.080000 - 0:33:22.240000::that has a name that I really am rocking with.
0:33:23.120000 - 0:33:24.800000::Yeah, it sounds like it's from a
0:33:24.800000 - 0:33:26.720000::Philip K. Pullman book.
0:33:28 - 0:33:30.320000::I couldn't tell you what that is.
0:33:30.320000 - 0:33:30.800000::But I was...
0:33:30.800000 - 0:33:32.640000::It sounds like it's from the Golden Compass.
0:33:32.640000 - 0:33:34::Remember those books?
0:33:34.320000 - 0:33:35.760000::With the polar bear on it.
0:33:35.760000 - 0:33:37.040000::Yeah, with the polar bear on it.
0:33:37.040000 - 0:33:37.760000::I remember that.

0:33:40.880000 - 0:33:42.480000::It sounds like a fantastical land.
0:33:42.480000 - 0:33:43.600000::It sounds like fantastical land.
0:33:43.600000 - 0:33:44.400000::Oh, you know what I want?
0:33:44.400000 - 0:33:46.400000::And I guess it is because they have special brown.
0:33:47.200000 - 0:33:48.240000::You know what I watched?
0:33:48.240000 - 0:33:49.680000::Oh, that's where Amsterdam was.
0:33:49.680000 - 0:33:51.040000::Recently, what?
0:33:51.040000 - 0:33:51.520000::What was it?
0:33:51.520000 - 0:33:52.400000::Pizza Pan.
0:33:53.360000 - 0:33:54.080000::The original.
0:33:54.560000 - 0:33:55.440000::Peter Pan.
0:33:55.440000 - 0:33:57.280000::I was talking to you Nate.
0:33:57.280000 - 0:33:59.360000::I was talking about Peter Pan last night.

0:34:01.920000 - 0:34:04.240000::Were you guys talking about the best YouTube video of all time
0:34:04.240000 - 0:34:05.680000::when he's swinging all around?
0:34:06.720000 - 0:34:07.520000::What is it?
0:34:08.640000 - 0:34:11.120000::You guys remember this YouTube video
0:34:11.120000 - 0:34:13.760000::where it's a high school production of Peter Pan

0:35:05.840000 - 0:35:06.840000::Oh, God.
0:35:06.840000 - 0:35:08.840000::Let's just give people a freebie at Chipotle.
0:35:08.840000 - 0:35:11.400000::Yeah, let's just run down fucking the...
0:35:12.400000 - 0:35:14.520000::There's a scene in the hot tub time machine
0:35:14.520000 - 0:35:16.120000::when they go back in time.
0:35:16.120000 - 0:35:17.960000::I don't want to spoil this movie for anybody,
0:35:17.960000 - 0:35:23.120000::but they go to this ski resort,
0:35:23.120000 - 0:35:24.720000::and it's all dilapidated from one there.
0:35:24.720000 - 0:35:27.920000::Remember it, and they're getting fucked up in a hot tub,
0:35:27.920000 - 0:35:30.400000::which is what sends them back in time.
0:35:30.400000 - 0:35:33.720000::And there's a montage of them getting all fucked up,
0:35:33.720000 - 0:35:36.720000::and it was just so 2010 coded,
0:35:36.720000 - 0:35:39.240000::where the camera's spinning around, hella fast.
0:35:39.240000 - 0:35:42.360000::There's guys in like bear suits, like flashing.
0:35:42.360000 - 0:35:43.360000::There's like...
0:35:45.360000 - 0:35:46.200000::It just...
0:35:46.200000 - 0:35:47.960000::And then they're flashing on, and then they show like,
0:35:47.960000 - 0:35:50.600000::right, the Reagan, like, you know, rubber mask,
0:35:50.600000 - 0:35:53.520000::and then it flashes to a Michael Jackson mask real quick.
0:35:54.520000 - 0:35:58.400000::It's just, we were so freeback in 2010 with our humor, you know?
0:35:58.400000 - 0:36:00.400000::Was that...
0:36:00.400000 - 0:36:02.760000::Did that movie have horse dicta and peg in it?
0:36:05.920000 - 0:36:07.360000::Is that a character?
0:36:07.360000 - 0:36:09.040000::I don't know what you just said.
0:36:09.040000 - 0:36:10.560000::Silent, silent, China.
0:36:12.160000 - 0:36:13.600000::No, I don't think it's a file.
0:36:13.600000 - 0:36:16.560000::I don't think it had that name in it.
0:36:17.360000 - 0:36:18.800000::Oh, that's Craig Robinson.
0:36:19.760000 - 0:36:21.520000::And by the way, no one is going to be mad
0:36:21.520000 - 0:36:24.240000::that you spoiled Hot Tubtime machine there.
0:36:24.240000 - 0:36:26.160000::That's what you think, man.
0:36:26.160000 - 0:36:28.240000::But there's a lot of people out there that care about film
0:36:28.240000 - 0:36:30.240000::and care about the integrity of story.
0:36:31.360000 - 0:36:32.160000::So...
0:36:32.160000 - 0:36:34.160000::Watch me spoil a movie.
0:36:34.160000 - 0:36:35.120000::Let's do a couple of them.
0:36:37.120000 - 0:36:37.920000::Oh yeah, let's spoil it.
0:36:37.920000 - 0:36:38.800000::Let's be fucking...
0:36:38.800000 - 0:36:42.160000::Because in 2024, we're villains.
0:36:42.160000 - 0:36:42.880000::Okay.
0:36:42.880000 - 0:36:45.120000::So let's spoil a couple of them, man.
0:36:45.120000 - 0:36:47.760000::Tom Hanks, happy at the Undergroundhog Day.
0:36:47.760000 - 0:36:49.040000::Got you.
0:36:49.040000 - 0:36:49.840000::That's Bill Murray.
0:36:50.800000 - 0:36:51.360000::Goddamn it.
0:36:52.640000 - 0:36:53.680000::I'm trying to think of one.
0:36:53.680000 - 0:36:54.320000::Star Wars.
0:36:54.320000 - 0:36:55.520000::Star Wars.
0:36:55.520000 - 0:36:57.040000::Star Wars.
0:36:57.040000 - 0:36:57.920000::Return to the Jedi.
0:36:59.920000 - 0:37:00.880000::Star Wars.
0:37:00.880000 - 0:37:01.760000::What happens?
0:37:01.760000 - 0:37:03.520000::Yoda dies or something like that?
0:37:03.520000 - 0:37:04.800000::No, Yoda dies.
0:37:04.800000 - 0:37:05.520000::Can't kill that guy.
0:37:05.520000 - 0:37:08.240000::We might be too stupid to spoil any single movie.
0:37:09.280000 - 0:37:10.480000::No, I just spoiled one kind of.
0:37:11.120000 - 0:37:11.600000::No, you're...
0:37:11.600000 - 0:37:13.760000::He said Tom Hanks is happy at the Undergroundhog Day.
0:37:13.760000 - 0:37:16.560000::I think Yoda's like brutally murdered in one of those.
0:37:16.560000 - 0:37:17.600000::Jesus Christ.
0:37:17.600000 - 0:37:19.760000::Yoda gets drawn in quarter at the end of one of them.
0:37:19.760000 - 0:37:20.240000::He gets hurt.
0:37:20.240000 - 0:37:22.080000::His throat was asked up against all those...
0:37:22.080000 - 0:37:23.680000::All those space horses kind of...
0:37:24.320000 - 0:37:25.440000::Just cold, just cold, just cold, just cold.
0:37:25.440000 - 0:37:26::Oh my god.
0:37:26 - 0:37:28.400000::Yoda versus Mini Me Epic Rap Battle of History.
0:37:28.400000 - 0:37:29.440000::That would be fucking awesome.
0:37:33.280000 - 0:37:33.920000::Can you imagine...
0:37:36.400000 - 0:37:37.760000::Yoda just laying it down.
0:37:38.800000 - 0:37:39.600000::You're fucking...
0:37:41.840000 - 0:37:43.440000::Nate, you sent me a picture.
0:37:43.440000 - 0:37:46.080000::I mean, this is for the public or the Patreon.
0:37:46.560000 - 0:37:48.080000::This is for the public.
0:37:48.080000 - 0:37:50.480000::This is one of the best picks ever.
0:37:51.520000 - 0:37:53.920000::This is the picture of Yoda going down on the...
0:37:55.920000 - 0:37:56.320000::... where's Jaina?
0:37:57.680000 - 0:37:58.720000::Is that correct?
0:37:58.720000 - 0:37:59.360000::Yes.
0:37:59.360000 - 0:38:00.400000::I have a couple of pictures.
0:38:00.400000 - 0:38:01.520000::I have one picture.
0:38:03.920000 - 0:38:05.520000::Somebody's like full dick.
0:38:05.520000 - 0:38:06.160000::It's just like...
0:38:07.680000 - 0:38:13.600000::Basically like a shoot on maybe a doll of Yoda's face.
0:38:14.240000 - 0:38:15.200000::It's not funny.
0:38:17.520000 - 0:38:18.720000::Because I don't know if they could...
0:38:18.720000 - 0:38:19.920000::We were at work on this one.
0:38:19.920000 - 0:38:20.720000::This is when we were working.
0:38:20.720000 - 0:38:21.600000::And then there's one of...
0:38:21.600000 - 0:38:22::This is...
0:38:25.760000 - 0:38:26.080000::Yeah.
0:38:26.080000 - 0:38:27.680000::And then I have one where Yoda's just like...
0:38:27.680000 - 0:38:28.720000::... fucking putting it down.
0:38:28.720000 - 0:38:29.680000::These are your...
0:38:29.680000 - 0:38:30.960000::...demand heart submissions.
0:38:30.960000 - 0:38:31.680000::All floppy.
0:38:31.680000 - 0:38:32.400000::They're down these.
0:38:33.760000 - 0:38:34.400000::Yeah.
0:38:35.360000 - 0:38:35.600000::Yep.
0:38:36.640000 - 0:38:39.440000::Nate hasn't exited all Yoda pornographic exhibit.
0:38:40.640000 - 0:38:41.360000::Coming to LA.
0:38:46.720000 - 0:38:48.720000::Why is it so hilarious Yoda...
0:38:48.720000 - 0:38:50.960000::Yeah, it's getting all nasty.
0:38:50.960000 - 0:38:52.960000::Because he's so wise that it's...
0:38:52.960000 - 0:38:53.360000::... you know...
0:38:55.040000 - 0:38:56.640000::Right, that it was funny that he would be...
0:38:56.640000 - 0:38:57.200000::It's so fun.
0:38:57.200000 - 0:38:58.320000::Yeah, just about his wisdom.
0:38:58.320000 - 0:39:00.480000::It's not about his shape or size or color.
0:39:00.480000 - 0:39:00.960000::No.
0:39:00.960000 - 0:39:01.840000::Or ears or ears or eyes or anything.
0:39:01.840000 - 0:39:02.720000::Do you think that whysness...
0:39:03.680000 - 0:39:07.040000::Do you think that whysness translates to a sexual whysness?
0:39:07.040000 - 0:39:09.760000::Because you know, there's different types of smarts.
0:39:09.760000 - 0:39:12.480000::As we know, you know, I might not know...
0:39:12.480000 - 0:39:15.520000::... geographically a lot of information about the world.
0:39:15.520000 - 0:39:17.280000::But I do have a lot of street smarts.
0:39:17.920000 - 0:39:19.520000::And those streets in the world.
0:39:19.520000 - 0:39:20.080000::Well, yeah.
0:39:20.080000 - 0:39:22.320000::So I'll say there are two different types of wisdom.
0:39:22.320000 - 0:39:25.040000::Because if you put the Dalai Lama and his sexual arena...
0:39:26.480000 - 0:39:27.760000::... he's gonna flounder.
0:39:27.760000 - 0:39:29.360000::I have a feeling.
0:39:29.360000 - 0:39:30.240000::You know what I'm saying?
0:39:30.240000 - 0:39:33.280000::I have a reverse feeling for some reason about that instinctually.
0:39:33.280000 - 0:39:34::Well, maybe...
0:39:34 - 0:39:34.640000::Yeah, maybe.
0:39:34.640000 - 0:39:35.440000::Has that...
0:39:35.440000 - 0:39:36.160000::May as well.
0:39:36.160000 - 0:39:37.440000::I get a little...
0:39:37.440000 - 0:39:38.880000::I don't know what a fan anybody...
0:39:38.880000 - 0:39:41.680000::I don't know what religion the Dalai Lama is or...
0:39:41.680000 - 0:39:42.800000::I should know this, but...
0:39:43.600000 - 0:39:44.400000::Sounds good.
0:39:45.360000 - 0:39:47.280000::We picked the wrong topics today somehow.
0:39:47.840000 - 0:39:48.640000::We are, you know.
0:39:49.520000 - 0:39:51.760000::We'll step in outside of our fucking topic.
0:39:51.760000 - 0:39:58::It takes so much courage to be this wrong about things publicly.
0:39:58 - 0:39:58.720000::Okay.
0:39:58.720000 - 0:40:00::A lot of other people are hiding behind us.

0:40:00 - 0:40:08::Google their hide and behind their encyclopedias, which I can't afford. And they pretend they profess to be scholars in knowledge
0:40:08 - 0:40:10::No, you can't afford a book.
0:40:11.500000 - 0:40:15.500000::You don't know my finances right now, man, or what I'm trying to do.
0:40:15.500000 - 0:40:20::A book is like, that can be free and good library.
0:40:20 - 0:40:21.500000::You know what I'm saying?
0:40:22.300000 - 0:40:28.300000::But I'm just saying I'm getting some different type of just be just be careful around the deli Lam, I'll just say that.
0:40:28.300000 - 0:40:29.300000::He's dead.
0:40:29.300000 - 0:40:33.300000::No, he's not. He's with us. He visited my university.
0:40:36.300000 - 0:40:39.300000::That sounded so British even though it wasn't.
0:40:40.300000 - 0:40:41.300000::He visited your university.
0:40:41.300000 - 0:40:43.300000::He visited my university.
0:40:43.300000 - 0:40:46.300000::Were you ever in like an acapella group?
0:40:46.300000 - 0:40:48.300000::No, they tried to get me. They tried.
0:40:48.300000 - 0:40:51.300000::I heard just the timbre of my voice, whatever.
0:40:51.300000 - 0:40:53.300000::Right. And they wanted me, but I said no.
0:40:53.300000 - 0:40:57.300000::Because you can't be bound by...
0:40:58.800000 - 0:41:02.300000::You need to have the complementation of instruments.
0:41:02.300000 - 0:41:03.300000::Right.
0:41:03.300000 - 0:41:08.300000::I just imagined jacking the acapella group just being so happy.
0:41:08.300000 - 0:41:10.300000::I feel like I could really see you.
0:41:10.300000 - 0:41:11.300000::What's funny about that?
0:41:11.300000 - 0:41:12.300000::I don't know.
0:41:12.300000 - 0:41:13.300000::What's funny about me being happy?
0:41:13.300000 - 0:41:17.300000::You being really, really like jovial and happy.
0:41:17.300000 - 0:41:19.300000::Don't stop me now.
0:41:20.300000 - 0:41:22.300000::Man, you're in a manic state.
0:41:22.300000 - 0:41:25.300000::I can't wait to get you on the flow, good looking.
0:41:25.300000 - 0:41:27.300000::Bo-da-do-do-do-do.
0:41:27.300000 - 0:41:32.300000::I like the low ones, the people with the baritone,
0:41:32.300000 - 0:41:35.300000::where they just come in the very end.
0:41:35.300000 - 0:41:37.300000::I can't wait to see.
0:41:37.300000 - 0:41:40.300000::It's like the...
0:41:40.300000 - 0:41:41.300000::Yeah.
0:41:41.300000 - 0:41:43.300000::They're singing about like a soda shop.
0:41:43.300000 - 0:41:45.300000::And they come in the very end of the bar.
0:41:45.300000 - 0:41:47.300000::And the glass of the bar.
0:41:47.300000 - 0:41:50.300000::Right. Creams sort of a cream.
0:41:50.300000 - 0:41:54.300000::Creamy Coca-Cola.
0:41:55.300000 - 0:41:56.300000::Mmm.
0:41:56.300000 - 0:42:00.300000::You know about this trend, putting a little cream in your Coke.
0:42:00.300000 - 0:42:01.300000::Coke Cola.
0:42:01.300000 - 0:42:03.300000::What the fuck did you say to me?
0:42:03.300000 - 0:42:04.300000::What kind of cream?
0:42:04.300000 - 0:42:06.300000::Coconut milk?
0:42:06.300000 - 0:42:07.300000::No, no.
0:42:07.300000 - 0:42:09.300000::Half and half regular cream.
0:42:09.300000 - 0:42:11.300000::Put it in a Coke.
0:42:11.300000 - 0:42:13.300000::Put it on a little monk.
0:42:13.300000 - 0:42:15.300000::Put it on a season one monk.
0:42:15.300000 - 0:42:17.300000::Put all the cream in your Coke.
0:42:17.300000 - 0:42:19.300000::See if you don't feel it.
0:42:19.300000 - 0:42:20.300000::That's it.
0:42:21.300000 - 0:42:25.300000::A half and half packet of Coke.
0:42:25.300000 - 0:42:27.300000::In a Coke?
0:42:27.300000 - 0:42:30.300000::No, you buy a little carton of half and half.
0:42:30.300000 - 0:42:32.300000::Pour it in the Coke.
0:42:32.300000 - 0:42:34.300000::Put it all over ice.
0:42:34.300000 - 0:42:37.300000::Wait, Nate, what did you think he was saying?
0:42:37.300000 - 0:42:38.300000::I thought...
0:42:38.300000 - 0:42:39.300000::No, no.
0:42:39.300000 - 0:42:40.300000::We were on the same page.
0:42:40.300000 - 0:42:43.300000::I was just thinking of, you know, those little half and half packets.
0:42:43.300000 - 0:42:44.300000::Yeah, those little cups.
0:42:44.300000 - 0:42:46.300000::They just never expire for some reason.
0:42:46.300000 - 0:42:47.300000::Yeah.
0:42:47.300000 - 0:42:48.300000::But they're milk.
0:42:48.300000 - 0:42:49.300000::Yeah.
0:42:49.300000 - 0:42:50.300000::They're not the diner.
0:42:50.300000 - 0:42:51.300000::Yeah.
0:42:51.300000 - 0:42:52.300000::I was just curious about why they don't expire.
0:42:52.300000 - 0:42:53.300000::How could they not?
0:42:53.300000 - 0:42:54.300000::I think they do.
0:42:54.300000 - 0:42:59.300000::We've got to get a guest in this podcast immediately.
0:42:59.300000 - 0:43:02.300000::Somebody from the United States.
0:43:02.300000 - 0:43:04.300000::Oh my gosh.
0:43:04.300000 - 0:43:05.300000::Oh, somebody made it.
0:43:05.300000 - 0:43:07.300000::It's all in being Peter Schaarsgard.
0:43:07.300000 - 0:43:11.300000::Hey, what was...how old are you?
0:43:11.300000 - 0:43:14.300000::You all saw the new Amanda Binds podcast?
0:43:14.300000 - 0:43:16.300000::Is that real?
0:43:16.300000 - 0:43:17.300000::Yeah.
0:43:17.300000 - 0:43:23.300000::They did one episode who was Amanda and her friend and then they...
0:43:23.300000 - 0:43:25.300000::Amanda canceled it because she...
0:43:25.300000 - 0:43:28.220000::They couldn't get the guests that they wanted.
0:43:28.220000 - 0:43:29.300000::They couldn't get the A-listers.
0:43:29.300000 - 0:43:30.300000::Shout out.
0:43:30.300000 - 0:43:31.300000::Shout out Amanda Binds.
0:43:31.300000 - 0:43:36.540000::Shout out all these child stars that went through the ringer for our entertainment.
0:43:36.540000 - 0:43:38.300000::We got to see bringing the lobster.
0:43:38.300000 - 0:43:39.780000::Sure, we got to laugh at that.
0:43:39.780000 - 0:43:41.300000::But at what cost, really?
0:43:41.300000 - 0:43:42.300000::A human lot of the earth.
0:43:42.300000 - 0:43:43.300000::I feel so bad for Amanda Binds.
0:43:43.300000 - 0:43:45.300000::That was the birth of randomness.
0:43:46.300000 - 0:43:47.300000::That was the...
0:43:47.300000 - 0:43:49.300000::The OG of the random sauce, Moody's point.
0:43:49.300000 - 0:43:51.300000::Moody's random person.
0:43:51.300000 - 0:43:54.300000::She was random as fuck and she still is, I bet.
0:43:54.300000 - 0:43:55.300000::Now, here's the...
0:43:55.300000 - 0:43:57.300000::I don't know how random she is now.
0:43:57.300000 - 0:43:58.300000::She's going through something.
0:43:58.300000 - 0:44:02.300000::Well, that's random to me because what could be more random than that?
0:44:02.300000 - 0:44:03.300000::True.
0:44:03.300000 - 0:44:04.300000::True enough.
0:44:04.300000 - 0:44:05.300000::I mean, now, is there...
0:44:05.300000 - 0:44:08.300000::This is so awful to even think.
0:44:08.300000 - 0:44:11.300000::But is there a world where...
0:44:11.300000 - 0:44:14.300000::This is actually the best version of her doll life.
0:44:14.300000 - 0:44:17.300000::And she was saved by being a childhood star because she could...
0:44:17.300000 - 0:44:21.300000::Maybe if she hadn't had success, it was just something that she would be like in the
0:44:21.300000 - 0:44:24.300000::woods with really long nails, fucking killing people.
0:44:24.300000 - 0:44:25.300000::You know what I'm saying?
0:44:25.300000 - 0:44:26.300000::And that was her whole thing.
0:44:26.300000 - 0:44:27.300000::Right.
0:44:27.300000 - 0:44:28.300000::What is that thing?
0:44:28.300000 - 0:44:29.300000::I'm Wolverine.
0:44:29.300000 - 0:44:30.300000::What is that thing?
0:44:32.300000 - 0:44:34.300000::I guess that's a good point.
0:44:34.300000 - 0:44:35.300000::I don't know.
0:44:35.300000 - 0:44:37.300000::It's just a thought experiment.
0:44:37.300000 - 0:44:41.300000::It's literally not anything other than a thought experiment.
0:44:41.300000 - 0:44:42.300000::I love that.
0:44:42.300000 - 0:44:43.300000::Yeah.
0:44:43.300000 - 0:44:44.300000::I don't quite know.
0:44:44.300000 - 0:44:45.300000::Well, can I say a life hack then?
0:44:45.300000 - 0:44:46.300000::Or just a new idea?
0:44:46.300000 - 0:44:47.300000::Please.
0:44:47.300000 - 0:44:48.300000::Please.
0:44:48.300000 - 0:44:50.300000::So, put that off your bingo.
0:44:50.300000 - 0:44:53.300000::This is what I would say is...
0:44:53.300000 - 0:44:59.300000::If you're watching a TV show or a movie and it's not got soundtrack, pop something.

0:45:00 - 0:45:06.160000::in your ear. Is that not interesting? Because what? 30 Rock doesn't have score. I've never seen it.
0:45:06.160000 - 0:45:12.800000::What else? So have like one earbud in. Yeah. Okay. Because the sitcoms and stuff like that,
0:45:12.800000 - 0:45:18.800000::they have laugh tracks, but they don't have a score. And to me, the denial of information musically
0:45:19.680000 - 0:45:24.080000::during any moment of human emotion, when portrayed in visual storytelling, it's like
0:45:24.320000 - 0:45:32.080000::you are robbing everybody of what you could really feel like. I don't know. I've been watching those
0:45:32.080000 - 0:45:39.120000::silent, you know, before they had sound for the World War Two footage, just classic raw World War Two
0:45:39.120000 - 0:45:45.040000::footage, watching that, putting in Travis Barker and his son going crazy, just two drums at once.
0:45:45.040000 - 0:45:52.160000::Oh my God. He's got a son that can drum too. Yeah. He does. And he also takes pictures. Do you
0:45:52.160000 - 0:45:58.720000::have you seen Travis Barker's son's photo album? It is the funniest. I want to buy it's like a big coffee
0:45:59.600000 - 0:46:06.960000::coffee table book size photo album. And it's called like my perspective. And it's just like the worst
0:46:06.960000 - 0:46:11.360000::digital camera picture. There's like one of an elephant and it's like the shadows are so bad. You
0:46:11.360000 - 0:46:18::can barely see it. We got to give it. All the patrons need to need to go and buy this right now. So
0:46:18 - 0:46:23.600000::he can keep taking pictures and make that a career. Please go out and support him. I could see Travis
0:46:23.600000 - 0:46:28.960000::Barker thinking that we are humiliating and him not wanting to be with us and calling us like
0:46:28.960000 - 0:46:34.400000::you guys are punk ass bitches. Travis Barker moves in silence. We you never know what he thinks. That's
0:46:34.400000 - 0:46:40.880000::his superpower. And he's quite skinny, isn't he? That's from drumming. Yeah, it's probably from all that
0:46:40.880000 - 0:46:50.320000::cardio. He gets from drumming you right. If we have if you guys have songs, are you gonna
0:46:53.440000 - 0:47:00.800000::why did that silence feel so right? I don't know. I think something's something's in the water
0:47:00.800000 - 0:47:04.480000::today. All right, come on. Turn it up. 10 minutes. Okay, yeah, let's do this. We got this.
0:47:04.480000 - 0:47:08.640000::If we had sons, Nate, what do you say Nate? If we had son, let me go off for a second.
0:47:09.440000 - 0:47:14.080000::Team you up. Let me go off. Yeah, get off. We had sons. We would be podcasting with them, right?
0:47:14.080000 - 0:47:19.920000::Wow. You know what I'm saying? Like Travis Barker style. Tiger Woods is son. There's a lot of
0:47:19.920000 - 0:47:26.240000::these just let your kid do it. They this one. I want to back up. Let your kid do what they want to do.
0:47:26.240000 - 0:47:30.560000::Are you forcing that on them? Do they really want to be a drummer? Do they really want to be a
0:47:30.560000 - 0:47:38::golfer Tiger Woods? I don't know. Can I say this? There's this trend. I get it for celebrities.
0:47:38 - 0:47:43.040000::Celebrities will post a picture, the whole family and put emojis over their children's face. They
0:47:43.040000 - 0:47:48.640000::want to protect the children's identity. I get that. But then, you know, someone that you
0:47:48.640000 - 0:47:55.280000::knew in Chicago has had a baby. They have about 70 followers on Instagram. They're blurring out the
0:47:55.280000 - 0:48:02.720000::face of their children online. You know what I'm saying? Is that right? You're hating on them
0:48:02.720000 - 0:48:08.320000::because you're not famous, dude. Let us see your kids. Let us see your kids. I think it's because
0:48:08.320000 - 0:48:12.160000::I know, if I'm a people, I know what they go through. I don't want to see people doing like
0:48:12.160000 - 0:48:17.840000::Dolan Famous Valor. You know what I'm saying? That's what gets my grines, my gears. Do you ever
0:48:17.840000 - 0:48:24.640000::think it's maybe about this internet rather? No, what the fuck am I trying to say? The TSA,
0:48:24.640000 - 0:48:31.680000::NSA. Yeah, could you see what I'm saying? Now that I think about it, you know, you're so foolish to
0:48:31.680000 - 0:48:38.960000::think that there aren't people in our government that can easily scrub away that little emoji that
0:48:38.960000 - 0:48:46.320000::you put on that file. No, no. That's so hilarious. That's honestly cute that you think that the
0:48:46.320000 - 0:48:50.800000::government can't do that, right? Well, jokes on you, dude, when you see that my kid has been
0:48:50.800000 - 0:48:57.440000::surgically modified his face to be an emoji to be an eggplant. Oh, oh, you'll never know what he
0:48:57.440000 - 0:49:04::looks like. Uh-huh, government. Second, we're about to get to most crazy as fuck surgeries going on.
0:49:07.840000 - 0:49:11.120000::Fuck surgery. Go up in a hospital. Say that shit.
0:49:11.120000 - 0:49:20.880000::Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. You're smart car. Oh, drive a smart car through the automatic doors.
0:49:20.880000 - 0:49:23.440000::Excuse me. I just want to say something. First of all,
0:49:25.840000 - 0:49:31.040000::yeah, whatever. I want to bust into a while there, doing like open heart. Like a really serious
0:49:31.040000 - 0:49:36.880000::surgery and just say something like that. Man, fuck surgery. It smells like shit. It smells like
0:49:37.360000 - 0:49:44.160000::shit. I bet that all I bet those rooms don't smell so good. I bet they smell really good to be honest.
0:49:44.160000 - 0:49:48.240000::Really, I think you think they're putting in bubblegum spray in the room to make it smell delicious.
0:49:48.800000 - 0:49:53.200000::Well, blood is not a bad smell. I don't know how I would know that.
0:49:54.320000 - 0:49:59.040000::You know that smell of me when you walk through the butcher section of the grocery store?

0:50:00 - 0:50:02.520000::Not really you don't know the meat smell
0:50:03.680000 - 0:50:10.760000::I'm really trying to know that smell right now trying to picture it too. I'm trying to I can't tap into that now
0:50:10.920000 - 0:50:13.400000::Wow, I might have a very sensitive nose
0:50:13.920000 - 0:50:16.840000::Just my suspicions have been confirmed. I have a very sensitive nose
0:50:17.680000 - 0:50:24::Well, my whole head is fucking full right now. I can't hear out of my left ear. I'm serious. I've had this nipples for over a month
0:50:24.360000 - 0:50:28.560000::What is that? What could that mean? Well, it could be the end?
0:50:29.400000 - 0:50:31.700000::Huh could be the end of the sky fall

0:53:23.020000 - 0:53:26.940000::In my mind it kind of ends with Maine and then it's just the woods up there
0:53:26.940000 - 0:53:31.140000::But really there's a whole country with cities and people and ideas
0:53:31.860000 - 0:53:35.060000::Hardly and they have their own TV shows. You know this
0:53:35.060000 - 0:53:40.420000::They have their own TV shows up there that we've never heard of that's crazy. That's probably amazing

0:53:57.740000 - 0:54:04.860000::pathetic. That's all it is. Oh, because you're saying the towns are so close to the border and actually pass that is all woods and mystery
0:54:04.860000 - 0:54:10.500000::It is all woods. That's why you have that feeling. Oh my God. We need to make a I bet there's some

1:02:14 - 1:02:17.520000::I personally, let's see, about two months ago,
1:02:17.520000 - 1:02:21.080000::I kind of scratched the back of my car
1:02:21.080000 - 1:02:23.600000::pulling out of my driveway.
1:02:23.600000 - 1:02:24.680000::Okay.
1:02:24.680000 - 1:02:26.360000::Little scratch, little paint on there.
1:02:26.360000 - 1:02:28.360000::Jack, you've seen it for sure disturbed you.
1:02:28.360000 - 1:02:30.040000::Sorry, but some humiliating.
1:02:30.040000 - 1:02:35.040000::And I got a scratch removal kit where you have to like drill,
1:02:35.040000 - 1:02:37.240000::you have like a sander,
1:02:37.240000 - 1:02:40.520000::and then you have these like primers and polish.
1:02:40.520000 - 1:02:43.160000::And I drilled it basically almost all the way off
1:02:43.160000 - 1:02:44.280000::to where you can barely tell.
1:02:44.280000 - 1:02:46.080000::There's a scratch there now.
1:02:46.080000 - 1:02:47.240000::Got all the paint off.
1:02:47.240000 - 1:02:50.800000::And there was just something about using that drill,
1:02:50.800000 - 1:02:54.040000::drilling onto the car that was so fun.
1:02:54.040000 - 1:02:56.520000::You kind of forget about that, that stuff can be fun.
1:02:56.520000 - 1:03:01.600000::So that's what gave me joy getting that scratch off the car.
1:03:01.600000 - 1:03:02.440000::Shout out.
1:03:02.440000 - 1:03:03.280000::That's fun.

1:03:25.320000 - 1:03:27.120000::with putting my keys on my pants, right?
1:03:27.120000 - 1:03:29.680000::Because it just frees up my pockets.
1:03:29.680000 - 1:03:34.680000::And I'm always tapping them when I'm walking around.
1:03:35.840000 - 1:03:36.960000::I'm jingling them.
1:03:36.960000 - 1:03:38.360000::I'm always touching them.
