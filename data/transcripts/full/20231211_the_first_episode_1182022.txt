0:07:22.600000 - 0:07:29::That I kind of in a weird way agree with the people
0:07:29 - 0:07:32.560000::that want there to be good guys with guns.
0:07:32.560000 - 0:07:37.920000::But only I think you have to have like a pass a test.
0:07:37.920000 - 0:07:43.120000::And I think I can really pass that test to be like a protector
0:07:43.120000 - 0:07:44.920000::a guy with a gun.
0:07:44.920000 - 0:07:49.160000::Because if that motherfucker came in my movie showing,
0:07:49.160000 - 0:07:52.120000::it wouldn't be on site instantly.
0:07:52.120000 - 0:07:55.840000::And you make him suffer kneecap, kneecap, elbow, elbow.
0:07:55.840000 - 0:07:57.080000::Oh, 100%.
0:07:57.080000 - 0:07:57.840000::Start soon.
0:07:57.840000 - 0:07:58.960000::I would torture that.
0:07:58.960000 - 0:08:01.240000::I would make everybody in the fucking movie theater
0:08:01.240000 - 0:08:03.440000::like just lock them in.
0:08:03.440000 - 0:08:06.640000::And then we kind of like spend four days just like slowly
0:08:06.640000 - 0:08:08.960000::peeling off his skin and like you
0:08:08.960000 - 0:08:11.040000::wanted this motherfucker.
0:08:11.040000 - 0:08:12.360000::It's torture.
0:08:12.360000 - 0:08:15.760000::There is something about I remember having crazy fantasies
0:08:15.760000 - 0:08:17.480000::when I was in middle school.
0:08:17.480000 - 0:08:19.560000::And I think wanting to be more liked and wanting
0:08:19.560000 - 0:08:22.440000::to be like seen as cool and masculine.
0:08:22.440000 - 0:08:24.280000::And I would literally pray for it.
0:08:24.280000 - 0:08:25.960000::There weren't really school shootings at the time.
0:08:25.960000 - 0:08:29.120000::But I would pray for like an intruder to come in.
0:08:29.120000 - 0:08:31.160000::And for me, everybody to be hiding from me
0:08:31.160000 - 0:08:33.280000::to sneak out of the classroom and take a pencil
0:08:33.280000 - 0:08:36.720000::and like step the fuck out of his neck a million times.
0:08:36.720000 - 0:08:39.720000::You would pray to God to deliver you this opportunity.
0:08:39.720000 - 0:08:40.920000::Well, I wasn't praying.
0:08:40.920000 - 0:08:43.360000::I don't know if I prayed to God, but I daydream heavily
0:08:43.360000 - 0:08:47.640000::about this while I was in the detention in math.
0:08:47.640000 - 0:08:48.640000::Because we wanted that white.
0:08:48.640000 - 0:08:49.480000::Thank you that sick.
0:08:49.480000 - 0:08:51.280000::That would make people would be kids.
0:08:51.280000 - 0:08:54.080000::If you did that would look at you in such horror.
0:08:54.080000 - 0:08:58.080000::If you were 11 years old and stabbed the fuck out of somebody.
0:08:59.040000 - 0:09:00.040000::Yeah.
0:09:00.040000 - 0:09:02.360000::Yeah, that would make you more popular in school.
0:09:02.360000 - 0:09:04.280000::Or do you think it would like be like, oh my God,
0:09:04.280000 - 0:09:07.680000::like he's like kind of the weird, the weird kid.
0:09:07.680000 - 0:09:11.440000::I think it would make you like ultimately look like a freak.
0:09:11.440000 - 0:09:12.440000::Yeah, I think so.
0:09:12.440000 - 0:09:14.440000::I think you were the killer.
0:09:14.440000 - 0:09:16.640000::But if it was for good, like my father.
0:09:16.640000 - 0:09:19.560000::Well, if it's for a good cause, I mean,
0:09:19.560000 - 0:09:21.480000::I just, I would stick up for him.
0:09:21.480000 - 0:09:23.920000::I'd say that kid has a superpower because.
0:09:24.920000 - 0:09:25.760000::Yeah.
0:09:25.760000 - 0:09:28::Everybody else, dude, we had this kid, you.
0:09:28 - 0:09:30.760000::Who we had a pregnant teacher and every time she would go
0:09:30.760000 - 0:09:33.480000::pee a lot in sixth grade and she would go,
0:09:33.480000 - 0:09:35.920000::every time she would leave the bathroom,
0:09:35.920000 - 0:09:40.600000::we would start shucking pencils, lighters, staplers,
0:09:40.600000 - 0:09:43.120000::like just beating, just like beating the shit out of him.
0:09:43.120000 - 0:09:48.040000::And eventually a basketball hoop in his driveway fell on his head.
0:09:48.040000 - 0:09:51.440000::And he was concussed and did he die?
0:09:51.440000 - 0:09:53.440000::Yeah.
0:09:53.440000 - 0:09:56.240000::I don't know that he died, but I don't know what happened to him.
0:09:56.240000 - 0:09:58.760000::I can't believe some people just go out like that.
0:09:58.760000 - 0:10:00.040000::Like some kind of like fuck.

0:10:00 - 0:10:05.360000::Dude, you did, all of us where we're living, we're lucky, but you live in some of these red
0:10:05.360000 - 0:10:09.520000::states, you get an apartment complex where everybody and their mom has some type of guns
0:10:09.520000 - 0:10:10.720000::sitting right next to them at all times.
0:10:10.720000 - 0:10:15.680000::You sitting right here, right now at any time, it could just come through the ceiling
0:10:15.680000 - 0:10:16.960000::directly on top of your head.
0:10:16.960000 - 0:10:19.760000::Okay, I got a question.
0:10:19.760000 - 0:10:25.800000::How do you guys want to go out of this world?
0:10:25.800000 - 0:10:27.840000::I was thinking about this.
0:10:27.840000 - 0:10:34.520000::I don't know, I was thinking if other people, I would maybe let somebody else kill me in
0:10:34.520000 - 0:10:38.840000::the best way that they would want to, where it's not even about me.
0:10:38.840000 - 0:10:46.120000::Let me give someone else a chance to kind of live that fantasy without any consequence.
0:10:46.120000 - 0:10:48.920000::Some tell that you're a good sexual partner as well, Jack.
0:10:48.920000 - 0:10:52.120000::Well, what's that you're speaking about this topic?
0:10:52.120000 - 0:10:53.800000::And by the way, I've heard that.
0:10:53.800000 - 0:10:56.400000::I've heard this is a great vine.
0:10:56.400000 - 0:11:01.680000::It's a great, amazing sexually, Mr. Pussy.
0:11:01.680000 - 0:11:06.080000::Let's just say they don't call me Mr. Pussy for no reason.
0:11:06.080000 - 0:11:09.240000::No, no, no, no, no, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey decidit.
0:11:09.240000 - 0:11:12.680000::I'm so scared because I'm doing this on a work computer that there's like trigger words
0:11:12.680000 - 0:11:21::that'll have them like record my zoom and maybe Pussy is pussy is one of them.
0:11:21 - 0:11:23.320000::It smells like shit in my room, all of a sudden.
0:11:23.320000 - 0:11:26.160000::Literally smells like crazy amounts of shit.
0:11:26.160000 - 0:11:27.160000::Like your pills.
0:11:27.160000 - 0:11:29.560000::No, there's no animals in here.
0:11:29.560000 - 0:11:31.280000::I don't know what it could be.
0:11:31.280000 - 0:11:32.280000::Go to the kitchen.
0:11:32.280000 - 0:11:35.760000::But so, Jack, you'd want to let someone kill you and fulfill their fantasy.
0:11:35.760000 - 0:11:38.040000::Yeah, I'd let it be up to them if I have to go out anyways.
0:11:38.040000 - 0:11:40.400000::I'm going to just tell them it's no biggie.
0:11:40.400000 - 0:11:41.400000::Craziest way.
0:11:41.400000 - 0:11:42.400000::It's all you.
0:11:42.400000 - 0:11:44.400000::Very interesting.
0:11:44.400000 - 0:11:48.240000::I don't know.
0:11:48.240000 - 0:11:54.520000::I think I'd like to have like a 15 year battle with cancer.
0:11:54.520000 - 0:12:00.280000::I beat it and it comes back and I beat it and it comes back and I beat it.
0:12:00.280000 - 0:12:05.960000::And then basically I know for a long time and I've talked about, maybe I've talked about
0:12:05.960000 - 0:12:10.760000::this with you guys before but I've had this fantasy of like scaring everybody so bad
0:12:10.760000 - 0:12:15.960000::in the hospice that I'm at because like everybody else is ready to go and I want to stay
0:12:15.960000 - 0:12:21::alive so bad that I'm like screaming and like my family's there.
0:12:21 - 0:12:23.840000::That's what Larry King did, right?
0:12:23.840000 - 0:12:24.840000::No, didn't he really?
0:12:24.840000 - 0:12:25.840000::He wanted to stay alive.
0:12:25.840000 - 0:12:26.840000::Isn't there a lot of people?
0:12:26.840000 - 0:12:27.840000::No.
0:12:27.840000 - 0:12:33.440000::I mean like terrified to die.
0:12:33.440000 - 0:12:34.840000::I'm sure a lot of people are.
0:12:34.840000 - 0:12:35.840000::We just don't know this.
0:12:35.840000 - 0:12:36.840000::Yeah, not me.
0:12:36.840000 - 0:12:37.840000::I don't know.
0:12:37.840000 - 0:12:38.840000::Yeah, not me.
0:12:38.840000 - 0:12:41.680000::Wait, what's Larry King's thing?
0:12:41.680000 - 0:12:42.680000::He was scared.
0:12:42.680000 - 0:12:46.600000::Didn't Larry King like all his final interviews leading up to his death as he was every single
0:12:46.600000 - 0:12:48.480000::one who's just saying like, man, I'm not ready.
0:12:48.480000 - 0:12:49.480000::I don't want to do it.
0:12:49.480000 - 0:12:51.520000::It's the worst thing I can get.
0:12:51.520000 - 0:12:52.520000::You know what's funny?
0:12:52.520000 - 0:12:57.880000::Larry King has been dogged on like for the past like 30 years.
0:12:57.880000 - 0:13:01.200000::I just remember like in Conan O'Brien like monologues.
0:13:01.200000 - 0:13:08.520000::They always like kind of pigeonhole him into being this ancient like person and that was
0:13:08.520000 - 0:13:16.720000::like the joke about Larry King like like in the 90s and this dude lived till 2021 or
0:13:16.720000 - 0:13:17.720000::2021.
0:13:17.720000 - 0:13:18.720000::Go out.
0:13:18.720000 - 0:13:21::Like 2021.
0:13:21 - 0:13:22::He was hustling.
0:13:22 - 0:13:23::He outlanded.
0:13:23 - 0:13:26::And he had like a three year old kid when he died.
0:13:26 - 0:13:27::A three year old.
0:13:27 - 0:13:28.760000::So how does that game imagine that?
0:13:28.760000 - 0:13:31::That kids probably a lot of it.
0:13:31 - 0:13:33::Well, let me make sure I'm sad.
0:13:33 - 0:13:34::I don't want to laugh.
0:13:34 - 0:13:35::It's a podcast.
0:13:35 - 0:13:36::You know what?
0:13:36 - 0:13:37::Rest in peace.
0:13:37 - 0:13:38::Rest in peace.
0:13:38 - 0:13:42.200000::One of my best friends dad's just died in 97 and he's our age.
0:13:42.200000 - 0:13:47.320000::We're going to be living 100% till we are 170.
0:13:47.320000 - 0:13:48.320000::I'm saying.
0:13:48.320000 - 0:13:50.440000::180 begging to die.
0:13:50.440000 - 0:13:52.040000::We're going to get to that point.
0:13:52.040000 - 0:13:55.600000::Did we just talk about this where it's going to be like, Oh man, this person died when
0:13:55.600000 - 0:13:56.600000::they're 382.
0:13:56.600000 - 0:13:57.600000::That's so sad.
0:13:57.600000 - 0:13:58.600000::They had so much time.
0:13:58.600000 - 0:13:59.600000::They were 610.
0:13:59.600000 - 0:14:07::I think we're going to be at the point where we have we have what I'm just coming up with
0:14:07 - 0:14:08.240000::this right now.
0:14:08.240000 - 0:14:10.080000::Half consciousness.
0:14:10.080000 - 0:14:17.720000::Where we're like subtly aware that our consciousness is not fully there because we are a cyborg.
0:14:17.720000 - 0:14:22.840000::And something in us has replaced the mechanism of consciousness.
0:14:22.840000 - 0:14:24.560000::So we're half in and half out.
0:14:24.560000 - 0:14:31.480000::And other people like, do you think there's people who have to make sure that like half of
0:14:31.480000 - 0:14:35.040000::our consciousness like that's probably been operated it somewhere right at some like
0:14:35.040000 - 0:14:36.800000::operating system.
0:14:36.800000 - 0:14:37.800000::The consciousness.
0:14:37.800000 - 0:14:41.120000::Do you think there's like a lower class of people that have to work at the conscious,
0:14:41.120000 - 0:14:42.840000::half consciousness facility?
0:14:42.840000 - 0:14:47.280000::They're like take care of business.
0:14:47.280000 - 0:14:50.960000::You know, like this could be a sci-fi movie right here we're talking about.
0:14:50.960000 - 0:14:51.960000::Well, it really could.
0:14:51.960000 - 0:14:54.720000::It's scary because it could be a reality too.
0:14:54.720000 - 0:14:56.920000::And some of the scariest movies came from reality.
0:14:56.920000 - 0:14:57.920000::Captain Phillips.
0:14:57.920000 - 0:14:58.920000::Yeah.
0:14:58.920000 - 0:14:59.920000::What else?

0:15:00 - 0:15:05.840000::Captain Phillips is so fucking oh I just watched out quiet on the western front the world war one movie
0:15:06.080000 - 0:15:10.040000::That's about world war one. It sounds like it's about the wild west
0:15:10.740000 - 0:15:12.740000::No, it's you gotta be kidding me
0:15:13.620000 - 0:15:17.280000::It's a world one and it's what I want to get back to the consciousness thing
0:15:17.280000 - 0:15:19.940000::But it is the most fucked up depiction of war
0:15:20.840000 - 0:15:25.440000::I've ever seen other than this movie come and see if you guys seen that movie come and see no
0:15:25.440000 - 0:15:29.820000::No, and they make more watch it because they make war look fucked up
0:15:30.040000 - 0:15:33.400000::Where in reality you see on tiktok and it's like everybody's
0:15:35.920000 - 0:15:37.920000::They make it look deadly
0:15:38.680000 - 0:15:44.180000::People forget about world war one. I think world war one was probably the most vicious
0:15:45.240000 - 0:15:51.780000::Not I'm not a historian or anything, but it sounds like the most terrifying war a literally
0:15:53.280000 - 0:15:56.540000::They were in between technologies like by world war two
0:15:56.540000 - 0:15:59.600000::I figured out some stuff. I feel like in world war one
0:15:59.600000 - 0:16:04.680000::They're kind of like had muskets and like horses a little bit, right? They started it was a mixture
0:16:05.380000 - 0:16:06.980000::They go but let me tell you this
0:16:06.980000 - 0:16:10.420000::There's a scene at the end of near the end of we're not spoiling it
0:16:10.420000 - 0:16:18.420000::But it's the end of the movie where it's been a horses and not muskets, but just like single fire like bolt action
0:16:19.420000 - 0:16:25.420000::Reloads and then at the end they start unleashing all this new technology
0:16:25.660000 - 0:16:28.260000::And it's from the German perspective so the Germans are like
0:16:28.900000 - 0:16:32.800000::failing they have no resources. There's few of them left and they're like
0:16:33.180000 - 0:16:38.500000::being forced to do these trenches that have already been taken and it's truly pointless and
0:16:39.260000 - 0:16:45.300000::They're in the trench and these tanks start coming over the horizon and they've never seen tanks before
0:16:45.300000 - 0:16:48.580000::It's the first time they've been unleashed on them and so they're like shooting at them
0:16:48.580000 - 0:16:51.420000::They don't know what they are and then the tanks just start fucking them up
0:16:52.140000 - 0:16:58.540000::Destroying them then behind them flame throwers and there's a kid in the movie that you become very attached to
0:17:05.980000 - 0:17:07.980000::We just log off the fuck
0:17:10.460000 - 0:17:12.460000::So that's act three
0:17:12.460000 - 0:17:14.460000::Act three of all squad on the one hand
0:17:17.900000 - 0:17:24.180000::Well, you know what this in the end of that movie about like killing each other after the wars already over
0:17:24.460000 - 0:17:26.460000::Yeah, they don't know yet
0:17:26.940000 - 0:17:33.660000::The wars like for the wars like ending in 10 minutes and they just like fucked up general makes him go back onto the battlefield for honor
0:17:34.060000 - 0:17:39.340000::Dude I went to in high school this kid named Ron who I was running the mile with
0:17:39.500000 - 0:17:45.580000::He had trench foot and he passed out and rolled into the side of the onto the side of the track because they didn't keep the grass up and
0:17:46.260000 - 0:17:48.780000::Everybody's foot he had trench foot in the blood
0:17:48.780000 - 0:17:52.060000::I went to his brain for real and he just everybody nobody knew what to do
0:17:52.060000 - 0:17:55.220000::So we just kept running and people when they get back to the coach would say like hey
0:17:55.220000 - 0:17:58.580000::Just like I had a seizure is rolled over on the side of the trench
0:17:58.580000 - 0:18:02.460000::I thought trench fits when you're fucking tall soggy from poor boot
0:18:02.820000 - 0:18:05.660000::Yeah, cuz he had he had it because he was
0:18:06.620000 - 0:18:13.220000::Living in America to get special medical attention because you couldn't get it where he was at and I guess they didn't keep an eye on his footwear
0:18:14.660000 - 0:18:19.300000::trench foot he would constantly just be like passing out and smack in his head on the corner of the desk
0:18:21.020000 - 0:18:23.020000::she
0:18:23.620000 - 0:18:25.620000::But trying to think if there's a movie plot
0:18:27.100000 - 0:18:30.540000::Oh trench foot is so fucking bad you do not want to get it
0:18:31.100000 - 0:18:33.740000::You know when your fingers get all pruny from being in the bath
0:18:33.740000 - 0:18:40.460000::Mm-hmm imagine that is across your whole foot in the craziest way damn imagine if yo
0:18:40.460000 - 0:18:47.540000::All right, here's a super villain idea trench face and he's got like half of his head has been in the bath too long
0:18:47.540000 - 0:18:49.540000::What happened to you the bath?
0:18:50.540000 - 0:18:54.820000::And he has a sexy as fuck mom who made him do all that shit. Yeah
0:18:56.740000 - 0:19:03.340000::So Renee's over here. Yeah, oh, yo, she's coming back. She's in a new movie or something really
0:19:03.740000 - 0:19:11.420000::Did want to come on here and say I did want to say Larry King's daughter passed away. No at four years old a two years old
0:19:11.740000 - 0:19:13.740000::No, this is his daughter that was 51
0:19:14.740000 - 0:19:16.740000::So long could you imagine your little
0:19:17.460000 - 0:19:20.580000::Sibling is does so does he have a really young?
0:19:20.780000 - 0:19:27.940000::There's a lot of kids kids to click through here. So and say whoa Larry King's got seeds really
0:19:28.980000 - 0:19:30.980000::He's got a good
0:19:30.980000 - 0:19:34.140000::Canon I don't know and it's got to have to fresh
0:19:34.820000 - 0:19:39.580000::Not I've been about half the nut that's ever gone into the world is from Larry King
0:19:40.260000 - 0:19:45.540000::Larry King is like fucking mitochondrial my Larry King. I bet you in 10,000 years
0:19:45.540000 - 0:19:49.060000::They're gonna look back at human genome sequences to study like early humans
0:19:49.060000 - 0:19:54.300000::And it's gonna be just like Larry King like in every biology textbook the King gene
0:19:55.300000 - 0:20:00.020000::Larry and little and let me say this Larry King. I think fulfills this

0:20:00 - 0:20:04.880000::theory that I have about age and how hot you are different ages. I think there's
0:20:04.880000 - 0:20:08.400000::something that happens where you reach the end of your youth kind of and you're
0:20:08.400000 - 0:20:12.600000::still trying to look like your youthful self and so you'll dye your hair, you've
0:20:12.600000 - 0:20:16.680000::kind of tried to dress in clothes that don't fit you as well anymore and for some
0:20:16.680000 - 0:20:23.640000::people it's from like 55 to 60, 48 to 60 and then you reach a point at 60 where
0:20:23.640000 - 0:20:28.380000::you just or 65 where you embrace age and you just look graceful and hot.
0:20:28.380000 - 0:20:34.220000::Larry King I think up to his game of being hot at around 65 but he was
0:20:34.220000 - 0:20:40.380000::ugly as a kid in the middle. Oh okay in the middle of his life he looked ugly.
0:20:40.380000 - 0:20:44.420000::You know what Ringo Star looks like right? Ringo Star is about 92 years old
0:20:44.420000 - 0:20:51.180000::and he looks so good. He looks amazing. No grays, six pack hung down to his
0:20:51.180000 - 0:21:01.820000::fucking. He's hung like Donkey Kong. He's hung like Donkey Kong. Larry King's
0:21:01.820000 - 0:21:08.860000::being hot older in his older age. If Larry King was 80 years old working at
0:21:08.860000 - 0:21:14.820000::McDonald's he would not be pulling any kind of new kids. He would not be bringing
0:21:14.820000 - 0:21:20.380000::any new kids. You're saying gold diggers have been flocking towards. How dare you
0:21:20.380000 - 0:21:28.460000::Nate? How dare you? Can I say this? I fucking hate gold diggers so badly. There is
0:21:28.460000 - 0:21:37.820000::there's this old guy who is I'm pretty sure a notable actor and the fucking that he's
0:21:37.820000 - 0:21:47.580000::bald in the show. And excuse me. And the wig that they put this
0:21:47.580000 - 0:21:54.260000::fucker in it looks so bad and so offensive to the bald community which I am you
0:21:54.260000 - 0:21:58.940000::know heavily involved in and we meet up very regularly to kind of talk about
0:21:58.940000 - 0:22:03.500000::bald issues. The wig that they put this fucker in is so offensive that I'm like
0:22:03.500000 - 0:22:07.660000::they better have some review. Are you looking at it online? I'm trying to find
0:22:07.660000 - 0:22:14.020000::it. I'm trying to find it. It looks it's so gross. It's like it's on the F F Murray
0:22:14.020000 - 0:22:20.780000::Abraham F Murray Abraham white lotus is he he's not a bald actor correct this is a
0:22:20.780000 - 0:22:27.780000::wig like oh my god. Oh it's a bald wig. It has to be or else he has like a
0:22:27.780000 - 0:22:32.500000::fucked up like hair bald the baldings. Yeah I see what you're saying that's
0:22:32.500000 - 0:22:38.300000::interesting. It looks fake. But I want to say that you you probably when you went
0:22:38.300000 - 0:22:44.260000::because you lost your hair early on. Yes. And what happened you probably you
0:22:44.260000 - 0:22:49.460000::probably thought I fucking lost the genetic lottery here but I have a theory. I
0:22:49.460000 - 0:22:54.620000::think ultimately you won out because it looks so natural on you right now and
0:22:54.620000 - 0:22:59.220000::you would look worse with hair and you rock it so well. You would look like she
0:22:59.220000 - 0:23:04.900000::with hair and eight. Oh Jesus Christ. That's what people say and I kind of agree
0:23:04.900000 - 0:23:10.780000::and I see other bald people and I'm like that look is good on that look is good
0:23:10.780000 - 0:23:19.180000::doesn't look as natural as Mr. Nate does. I gotta get great. Got what Jay? I got a
0:23:19.180000 - 0:23:24.140000::Google image that y'all should check out. What? Look up Vin Diesel in the movie
0:23:24.140000 - 0:23:33.460000::find me guilty and look at the wig they got him in. Vin Diesel find me guilty. Oh
0:23:33.460000 - 0:23:45.180000::look at me. I know that. I was gonna say how good he looks. He looks like a fucking
0:23:45.180000 - 0:23:50.100000::they got him with the Mohawk somehow. He's like a dumb alike. That's like a
0:23:50.100000 - 0:23:58.940000::string theory. That's amazing. Hey that's a great movie. Shout out Vin Diesel. Oh wait. I don't
0:23:58.940000 - 0:24:03.660000::know if I can bring this up now because it's a TikTok but I found somebody who looks
0:24:03.660000 - 0:24:09.300000::exactly like you. Remember how we were talking about last week how we don't look like
0:24:09.300000 - 0:24:13.380000::anybody. Yeah. I know Joe. I don't know if like I was like how people like sent

0:24:23.180000 - 0:24:29.740000::with Eric Raill and they'll tag maybe the ugliest person I've ever seen. Okay. It's
0:24:29.740000 - 0:24:33.620000::funny because here I'm just gonna put it up to the zoom screen right now as this
0:24:33.620000 - 0:24:38.940000::is this person looks like I want to say that nobody has ever sent this guy to you. He's
0:24:38.940000 - 0:24:44.580000::like a singer and a rapper. He's like let me see Kelly. Let me see.
0:24:44.580000 - 0:24:52.740000::I literally and I came out to see one. This guy's got on sunglasses and I had.
0:24:52.740000 - 0:24:59.780000::And I had. He's like, is that Eric? His moves are amazing. He's doing
0:24:59.780000 - 0:24:59.900000::great.

0:25:00 - 0:25:03.120000::Is there another video of it?
0:25:03.120000 - 0:25:05.840000::You got to send a screenshot to the group.
0:25:05.840000 - 0:25:06.360000::All right.
0:25:06.360000 - 0:25:07.680000::Yeah.

0:25:12.440000 - 0:25:14.880000::Oh, it really does.
0:25:14.880000 - 0:25:17.760000::No, no, no, it's even live.
0:25:17.760000 - 0:25:19.880000::That looks like if you would clear down your act a little bit.
0:25:19.880000 - 0:25:21.600000::If you got the faith like that on your beer,
0:25:21.600000 - 0:25:23.560000::this is clean air at Grey Hill.
0:25:23.560000 - 0:25:24.880000::Oh my God.
0:25:24.880000 - 0:25:25.240000::Yeah.
0:25:25.240000 - 0:25:28.240000::Well, hey, I think natural is clean.
0:25:28.240000 - 0:25:34.480000::I'm natural 100% and I'm losing weight rapidly.
0:25:34.480000 - 0:25:35.920000::Rapidly losing weight.
0:25:35.920000 - 0:25:38.560000::Weight can be what everybody's weight right now.
0:25:38.560000 - 0:25:40.040000::On his weight.
0:25:40.040000 - 0:25:41.200000::190.
0:25:41.200000 - 0:25:43.640000::I think I'm probably gaining weight right now.
0:25:43.640000 - 0:25:45.520000::I'm probably at 186.
0:25:45.520000 - 0:25:46.280000::I bet.
0:25:46.280000 - 0:25:51.400000::But although I will say this, I don't fucking weigh myself ever.
0:25:51.400000 - 0:25:53.520000::So you have to do for this kind of drive.
0:25:53.520000 - 0:25:55.320000::Because every week we do a weigh in.
0:25:55.320000 - 0:25:55.840000::God damn it.
0:25:55.840000 - 0:25:58::And I'm hoarding just to.
0:25:58.960000 - 0:26:00.640000::Put it back on.
0:26:00.640000 - 0:26:03.560000::I'm 213.
0:26:03.560000 - 0:26:04.760000::Good shit.
0:26:04.760000 - 0:26:06.560000::I need to get down now.
0:26:06.560000 - 0:26:08.480000::You're 213.
0:26:08.480000 - 0:26:12.240000::2 plus 1 is 333, number of Christ.
0:26:12.240000 - 0:26:13.440000::That's interesting.
0:26:13.440000 - 0:26:14.280000::That's interesting.
0:26:14.280000 - 0:26:16.120000::Or wait, 2 plus 1, 2, 1, 3.
0:26:16.120000 - 0:26:17.400000::So.
0:26:17.400000 - 0:26:20.720000::Well, I don't fuck with number, I'll jelly.
0:26:25.720000 - 0:26:27.720000::What do you know, Fred?
0:26:27.720000 - 0:26:30.080000::Let's go around and say what we just said are weights,
0:26:30.080000 - 0:26:32.040000::which is very vulnerable, whatever,
0:26:32.040000 - 0:26:33.680000::all trying to do better.
0:26:33.680000 - 0:26:36.640000::But let's go around and tell each other what weight we think
0:26:36.640000 - 0:26:38.800000::the other person is the best at.
0:26:38.800000 - 0:26:39.800000::All right.
0:26:39.800000 - 0:26:41.560000::So we're fine.
0:26:41.560000 - 0:26:43.200000::OK, I'll start with Nate.
0:26:43.200000 - 0:26:44.400000::I'll start with Nate.
0:26:44.400000 - 0:26:49.360000::Nate, I think that at a, if you work through physical therapy
0:26:49.360000 - 0:26:50.800000::through the back thing that happened,
0:26:50.800000 - 0:26:53.600000::and you get back in the gym and start putting on muscle,
0:26:53.600000 - 0:26:57.040000::you at 195 with some fucking muscle on.
0:26:57.040000 - 0:26:59.280000::Oh my god.
0:26:59.280000 - 0:27:00.120000::Good god.
0:27:00.120000 - 0:27:01.560000::I'm going to be in that right now.
0:27:01.560000 - 0:27:02.560000::Yeah.
0:27:02.560000 - 0:27:03.080000::Wow.
0:27:03.080000 - 0:27:04.080000::Tan.
0:27:04.080000 - 0:27:05.080000::Back to Costa Rica.
0:27:05.080000 - 0:27:06.480000::Well, that's very good again.
0:27:06.480000 - 0:27:08::Kissing on my neck.
0:27:08 - 0:27:08.960000::Kissing on my neck.
0:27:08.960000 - 0:27:10.080000::By a barber.
0:27:10.080000 - 0:27:13.320000::Getting some of my sexual barber.
0:27:13.320000 - 0:27:16.240000::You won't have to even pay people good right now.
0:27:16.240000 - 0:27:17.160000::We know what.
0:27:17.160000 - 0:27:19.960000::To make videos and you'll make any.
0:27:19.960000 - 0:27:21.880000::Pretty much every haircut is from the back
0:27:21.880000 - 0:27:22.880000::when you think about it.
0:27:22.880000 - 0:27:23.880000::Uh.
0:27:23.880000 - 0:27:25.880000::That's a haircut on the back.
0:27:25.880000 - 0:27:26.880000::Yeah.
0:27:26.880000 - 0:27:31.640000::And Eric, I think we're going to have you be.
0:27:31.640000 - 0:27:34.920000::I mean, I think just cut down to like 150, 145.
0:27:34.920000 - 0:27:38.480000::Honestly, maybe 135 because you got all the muscle you need.
0:27:38.480000 - 0:27:40.720000::All you got to do is that muscle, you could lose,
0:27:40.720000 - 0:27:43.400000::you could lose 10 pounds of muscle and you'd still look strong.
0:27:43.400000 - 0:27:45.520000::So it just come down to 130.
0:27:45.520000 - 0:27:49.120000::But now, if I was 130, I'd be in so many fucking movies.
0:27:49.120000 - 0:27:50.560000::I'm literally, you would be.
0:27:50.560000 - 0:27:51.560000::I'd be here with her.
0:27:51.560000 - 0:27:52.560000::I disagree.
0:27:52.560000 - 0:28:00.720000::I think Eric, you are like, you need to be at like legitimately,
0:28:00.720000 - 0:28:03.320000::like 700 pounds.
0:28:03.320000 - 0:28:08::And you need to be a part of like one of those TLC reality shows

0:28:11.880000 - 0:28:15.800000::And like, just like, now you should be on a reality show

0:28:17.520000 - 0:28:18.040000::What's up?
