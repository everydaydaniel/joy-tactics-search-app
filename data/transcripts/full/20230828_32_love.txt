0:00:40.160000 - 0:00:44.320000::Yeah, I love this. And today's episode is about love,
0:00:44.320000 - 0:00:51.840000::and that's why we're in this bed together. Not because of circumstances that we couldn't control,
0:00:51.840000 - 0:01:00.800000::and now that's what it is. We are coming to you live the night before the podcast releases
0:01:00.800000 - 0:01:09.200000::from the ASOTEL in downtown beautiful downtown Los Angeles, where it isn't unsettling to be
0:01:09.200000 - 0:01:15.600000::outside sometimes. Oh shit. And the Madelo just- The Madelo's flowing. The Madelo's are flowing.
0:01:15.600000 - 0:01:21.040000::The vibes are amazing. This has actually been a requested episode. The love of many people have
0:01:21.040000 - 0:01:25.120000::been every time we put out an episode that people are like, when are we guys going to talk about love?
0:01:25.120000 - 0:01:28.240000::Yeah. When are you going to talk about relationships? When are you going to talk about
0:01:28.240000 - 0:01:31.840000::connecting with other human beings? Well, we're going to do it right at the fuck now.
0:01:31.840000 - 0:01:35.920000::Yeah. And we talk about that stuff regularly, no matter what the subject is. Of course,
0:01:35.920000 - 0:01:39.280000::because it's one of the core tenets of human existence. So naturally, it'll come up
0:01:40.160000 - 0:01:45.680000::irregardless. But today we're going to do a deep dive into love. We're going to open because we're
0:01:45.680000 - 0:01:53.600000::going to open our brains and go down to the heart from there. I really thought I was going to say
0:01:53.600000 - 0:01:58.320000::something cool there. I thought I had a story. You're his hella close. I know, right?
0:01:58.320000 - 0:02:03.520000::Well, I walked up to the door of the idea and nobody was home. Your hip percentage is really high,
0:02:03.520000 - 0:02:09.360000::though. And it's going up by the way. It's going up. Yeah. Thanks, guys. So we're going to get into
0:02:09.360000 - 0:02:17.120000::love. But I just think we glossed over the fact that we are in the ace hotel in Los Angeles,
0:02:17.120000 - 0:02:21.760000::where many people that are listening to this could only dream of staying in a hotel so swaggy.
0:02:22.480000 - 0:02:29.440000::And yeah, if you own the ace hotel, shout out to you for getting away with basically exposed
0:02:29.440000 - 0:02:37.760000::concrete everywhere, a poor temperature control, rock hard beds. What else? The design of this
0:02:38.560000 - 0:02:48.240000::hotel is you know, like if you I guess like interior design wise, like it's trendy to like not do
0:02:48.240000 - 0:02:54.880000::anything. Right. Yeah. And I feel like they got away with a lot. They definitely did. I would say when
0:02:54.880000 - 0:03:01.600000::I'm looking around here, some words that come to mind, North Korea, Soviet Russia, yeah, halo,
0:03:01.600000 - 0:03:07.120000::like a room in James Bond and 64 gold and I that has no fucking items in it. It just is a room.
0:03:07.120000 - 0:03:12.720000::Right. It's like an error. It's just a fucking play like a texture and like a video game from the 90s.
0:03:12.720000 - 0:03:17.440000::And let me just say this. This room is one acoustic guitar on the wall away. One
0:03:18.320000 - 0:03:25.360000::crossly record player away from just being. Remember those. Remember those when everybody was getting
0:03:25.360000 - 0:03:29.280000::the fuck out of those urban outfitters. And by the way, there's a urban outfitters across the street.
0:03:29.280000 - 0:03:36.240000::I haven't gotten a chance to check it out yet. But it looks like people, many people have tried to
0:03:36.240000 - 0:03:43.520000::claw out of this room because there's like I feel death. I feel like I have of death. I feel
0:03:43.520000 - 0:03:49.520000::some sort of something's right. 1940 suicide in this building. There's some. Oh, they were killing
0:03:49.520000 - 0:03:55.360000::themselves out here in downtown. He imagined 1920. The the fucking Great Depression hits. They were
0:03:55.360000 - 0:03:59.120000::running out those windows. Well, they do back then. It's like, what do you guys want to do today? Oh,
0:03:59.120000 - 0:04:02.880000::I found a building that's about eight floors high. So we see who's ahead. Fucking hits the hardest
0:04:02.880000 - 0:04:07.120000::song on the fucking ground. It wasn't because they were sad. It was just like, well, you know,
0:04:07.120000 - 0:04:13.520000::I just had a thought actually. Do you think there's any chance that every single room in this hotel
0:04:13.520000 - 0:04:19.920000::right now has somebody doing a podcast in it? There's probably about four or five running right now.
0:04:19.920000 - 0:04:24.560000::There's sneaker heads are I think in town. Oh, Mackelmore's got a concert. Yeah. We need to we need
0:04:24.560000 - 0:04:31.040000::to link up with the sneaker heads and form an alliance. Why don't they come sneaker feet? Hello.
0:04:31.040000 - 0:04:35.920000::That's it. It's an interesting point. You know, oh, no, no, no, I get I get it because it's like
0:04:35.920000 - 0:04:41.840000::I got their head because head is like the pole. Yeah, I know that. Sneaker heads.
0:04:41.840000 - 0:04:44.480000::Sucking off us. Sucking off a sneaker.
0:04:47.840000 - 0:04:55.680000::You know somebody has. Oh, wait, wait. Oh, I thought you just I want to shout out a creator.
0:04:56.320000 - 0:04:59.920000::I want to send some speaking of love. I want to send some love to a creator.

0:05:00 - 0:05:08.400000::This creator is named Maddy Tingles and he is an ASMR artist and you know I'm not rocking
0:05:08.400000 - 0:05:15.120000::with every single one of his videos but he does these shoe closet haul kind of videos
0:05:15.120000 - 0:05:21.440000::where he brings out this shoe and he's tapping on the box and then he fucking pulls him
0:05:21.440000 - 0:05:25.420000::out and then just the way that he rocks with the shoes and makes noises with him he's
0:05:25.420000 - 0:05:29.560000::tapping the rope on the bottom he's taking the tongues out tapping the tap in this
0:05:29.560000 - 0:05:33.880000::I thought you meant closet haul like a closet and a hallway but now I get it
0:05:33.880000 - 0:05:38.800000::but Maddy Tingles look up his shoe videos
0:05:38.800000 - 0:05:45.720000::I have a question yeah what did people do before ASMR was because I feel like so
0:05:45.720000 - 0:05:52.480000::many people rock with ASMR but it feels like a fairly new phenomenon like
0:05:52.480000 - 0:05:58.180000::what did people do to get to get to get to the internet to stand to like you know
0:05:58.180000 - 0:06:01.300000::yeah of course I mean I'm trying to think of what it's dimmed me out back in the
0:06:01.300000 - 0:06:09.960000::day I feel like getting in front of a box fan and going and by the way guys I did a

0:06:44.300000 - 0:06:49.780000::the feeling of love like oh you're you never been in love you were too young but
0:06:49.780000 - 0:06:56.400000::what I say is what I say is the older you get the harder it is harder the more
0:06:56.400000 - 0:07:01.920000::effort you have to put into love so when someone's love is work it's effort it's

0:07:41.740000 - 0:07:47.880000::floors we are 11 floors that's enough to do you know that if you're higher up in the
0:07:47.880000 - 0:07:56.140000::sky your brain is more creative where did you read these I don't know I think my I think
0:07:56.140000 - 0:08:00.300000::my girlfriend told me this what do you mean she was like if if you're on a plane like you
0:08:00.300000 - 0:08:06.700000::your your brain is like more focused or something like that more higher altitude you are well
0:08:06.700000 - 0:08:14.540000::who knows if this is true so we could do a test right we should do get up up to the one
0:08:14.540000 - 0:08:21.140000::world trade center or whatever and we should maybe like try to take a math quiz online
0:08:21.140000 - 0:08:26.300000::yeah on the first floor second floor third fourth and then we could do it again with some
0:08:26.300000 - 0:08:32.260000::a creative task freestyle for on every floor whoa you get to the fucking town walk
0:08:32.260000 - 0:08:46.380000::yeah I love that I love that altitude based I've been saying something if have you heard
0:08:46.380000 - 0:08:53.700000::of this concept of being of being on parole not for distance but for altitude so you can
0:08:53.700000 - 0:08:59.700000::go anywhere in the world but you got to watch out sea level wise oh so you can't go to
0:08:59.700000 - 0:09:07.300000::like Nepal no then fucking just kill me if I can't go to Nepal give me put execute me if I can
0:09:07.300000 - 0:09:12.700000::get up there and by the way if I was climbing Everest and there I had some I'd be respecting the
0:09:12.700000 - 0:09:19.140000::fuck out of the Sherpas so hard to happen to them giving them joint joints they are the and they
0:09:19.140000 - 0:09:26.300000::drink beer too by the way I hope so what is a Sherpa oh you're fucking white ignorance is coming

0:13:24.160000 - 0:13:25.160000::Oh, God.
0:13:25.160000 - 0:13:31.760000::And this dude, I mean, there's just so much pain involved in the other part of it.
0:13:31.760000 - 0:13:38::What did Mr. Day Lewis do in his past life to be so empathetic and know so much about
0:13:38 - 0:13:39::the human condition?
0:13:39 - 0:13:40::Well, now what did he do?
0:13:40 - 0:13:41::He probably wasn't a human being.
0:13:41 - 0:13:42.400000::He was probably a wave.
0:13:42.400000 - 0:13:44.680000::Oh, yeah, probably a psychic wave.
0:13:44.680000 - 0:13:46.800000::Did he mean like a wave Lewis?
0:13:46.800000 - 0:13:47.800000::Wet wave?
0:13:47.800000 - 0:13:48.800000::Yeah, of course.

0:13:51.800000 - 0:13:55.120000::We kind of let the, oh, yeah, go by the way.
0:13:55.120000 - 0:13:58.120000::That's our catchphrase.
0:13:58.120000 - 0:14:01.920000::Daniel, motherfucking day, ass Lewis.

0:14:02.920000 - 0:14:05::Man, he imagine, who is he?
0:14:05 - 0:14:06.880000::Imagine Daniel Day Lewis comes in here right now.
0:14:06.880000 - 0:14:08.440000::Can you imagine he walks in here right now?
0:14:08.440000 - 0:14:13.480000::Oh, Daniel Day Lewis walks in here right now, I'm saying, how did you get in here?
0:14:13.480000 - 0:14:14.480000::Who are you?
0:14:14.480000 - 0:14:15.480000::Hello?
0:14:15.480000 - 0:14:17.120000::I don't think I quite could recognize him.
0:14:17.120000 - 0:14:18.120000::Really?
0:14:18.120000 - 0:14:19.720000::Well, you probably know, definitely not.
0:14:19.720000 - 0:14:20.720000::You're not.
0:14:20.720000 - 0:14:22.520000::Because he blends into every single character.
0:14:22.520000 - 0:14:24.240000::So you don't know what, right?
0:14:24.240000 - 0:14:28.440000::It's like, what about Bill DeButcher from fucking, oh, my God.
0:14:28.440000 - 0:14:29.440000::You don't know who Bill DeButcher is.
0:14:29.440000 - 0:14:32.360000::I know Bill DeBlos, you know what I'm not a fan.
0:14:32.360000 - 0:14:34.120000::It's not a time to get political.
0:14:34.120000 - 0:14:39.520000::Bill DeButcher was his character from the gangs of New York.
0:14:39.520000 - 0:14:43.720000::You're a damn, I haven't seen that shit in a minute.
0:14:43.720000 - 0:14:44.960000::That's an incredible movie.
0:14:44.960000 - 0:14:45.960000::I just, yeah.
0:14:45.960000 - 0:14:48.400000::Of course, Aisy, joint.
0:14:48.400000 - 0:14:49.400000::Damn, this first.
0:14:49.400000 - 0:14:50.680000::How long do they call him joints?
0:14:50.680000 - 0:14:51.680000::He said.
0:14:51.680000 - 0:14:55.280000::Oh, I already said this, but I saw fucking spike, spike, spike, leave.
0:14:55.280000 - 0:14:57.280000::Yeah, he's the person who invented the joint.
0:14:57.280000 - 0:14:58.280000::The spike, leave, joint.
0:14:58.280000 - 0:15:00::I was spike, leave, joint, spike.

0:15:00 - 0:15:02.460000::a Nate Varone joint.
0:15:02.460000 - 0:15:04.720000::And then Michael Scott took that shit over.
0:15:04.720000 - 0:15:07.380000::There was a Michael Scott joint joke in the office.
0:15:07.380000 - 0:15:08.640000::Oh, was there really?
0:15:08.640000 - 0:15:09.480000::Yeah.
0:15:11.360000 - 0:15:16.360000::So, being in love is like being on a crazy ass drug.
0:15:17.280000 - 0:15:19.200000::Right, we all know this.
0:15:19.200000 - 0:15:22.440000::It really is, it really certainly is.
0:15:22.440000 - 0:15:25.560000::You know, the craziest love, okay, I love my girlfriend.
0:15:25.560000 - 0:15:27.580000::I love my family.
0:15:27.580000 - 0:15:32.580000::I love you guys, but the craziest love I feel is yourself.
0:15:33.300000 - 0:15:35.140000::Definitely not for myself.
0:15:36.340000 - 0:15:39.340000::I don't wanna go into it, but I got the opposite.
0:15:41.940000 - 0:15:43.300000::Isn't that crazy to hear?
0:15:43.300000 - 0:15:45.100000::Is that the whole thing?
0:15:45.100000 - 0:15:48.380000::There are so many people that would do anything
0:15:48.380000 - 0:15:51.580000::to be you or people you know that.
0:15:51.580000 - 0:15:53.380000::Do you truly know that?
0:15:53.380000 - 0:15:56.420000::That people, there are so many people in this world.
0:15:56.420000 - 0:16:00.660000::That would fucking literally just slit their wrists
0:16:00.660000 - 0:16:01.820000::to become you.
0:16:01.820000 - 0:16:02.660000::You're talking about-
0:16:02.660000 - 0:16:07.220000::If you could have a guarantee right now
0:16:07.220000 - 0:16:09.460000::that if you ended it, you would wake up.
0:16:10.460000 - 0:16:12.060000::Basically, yeah, it's rare.
0:16:12.060000 - 0:16:13.380000::Would you do it?
0:16:13.380000 - 0:16:14.220000::I think a lot of-
0:16:14.220000 - 0:16:15.500000::I think most people would say, yeah.
0:16:15.500000 - 0:16:18.740000::Sea pap is the sleep apnea, disease included.
0:16:18.740000 - 0:16:19.580000::Yeah.
0:16:19.580000 - 0:16:22.700000::So let people know right now who are gonna say yes
0:16:22.700000 - 0:16:25.740000::to this hypothetical situation
0:16:25.740000 - 0:16:28.380000::and deter them from wanting to be you.
0:16:28.380000 - 0:16:30.180000::All right, you guys, what are they in for?
0:16:30.180000 - 0:16:31.340000::All right.
0:16:31.340000 - 0:16:34.620000::So you guys know how there's war and peacetime, right?
0:16:34.620000 - 0:16:36.540000::No, there's peacetime right now.
0:16:36.540000 - 0:16:38.220000::We're in a general peacetime.
0:16:39.340000 - 0:16:40.740000::Not for my ass.
0:16:40.740000 - 0:16:42.620000::If you get in my head, it's fucking.
0:16:43.900000 - 0:16:45.780000::Shrapnel all day.
0:16:45.780000 - 0:16:46.900000::All fucking days.
0:16:46.900000 - 0:16:48.220000::Ah, I got it.
0:16:51.460000 - 0:16:54.460000::I got a fucking sea pat machine that I got to hook my fucking nose
0:16:54.460000 - 0:16:56.860000::up to every night.
0:16:56.860000 - 0:16:58.220000::If I want to take an app,
0:16:58.220000 - 0:17:00.180000::I've got to put that shit on.
0:17:00.180000 - 0:17:02.140000::What else?
0:17:02.140000 - 0:17:04.380000::I got sick recently.
0:17:04.380000 - 0:17:05.220000::My family.
0:17:05.220000 - 0:17:06.500000::I forgot your life is hell.
0:17:06.500000 - 0:17:07.820000::I haven't even got about that fact.
0:17:07.820000 - 0:17:09.820000::Crazy, small ass family.
0:17:09.820000 - 0:17:11.340000::Small what?
0:17:11.340000 - 0:17:12.420000::A crazy small what?
0:17:12.420000 - 0:17:13.420000::Family.
0:17:13.420000 - 0:17:15.540000::Small like size wise or like number three.
0:17:15.540000 - 0:17:18.020000::You actually, probably if we're talking about that,
0:17:18.020000 - 0:17:20.060000::other thing if we're talking about innuendo,
0:17:20.980000 - 0:17:22.260000::it's like a fucking cocaine.
0:17:22.260000 - 0:17:23.780000::So you don't gotta worry about it.
0:17:23.820000 - 0:17:25.420000::I got going on down there.
0:17:25.420000 - 0:17:28.060000::All right, well, cocaine's coming different sizes as well.
0:17:28.060000 - 0:17:29.220000::So it is.
0:17:29.220000 - 0:17:30.740000::You got the Euro coke can.
0:17:30.740000 - 0:17:31.900000::I know that's what you got.
0:17:31.900000 - 0:17:33.500000::Like a genius.
0:17:33.500000 - 0:17:34.500000::What?
0:17:34.500000 - 0:17:35.980000::No, dude.
0:17:35.980000 - 0:17:37.140000::No, I've seen it.
0:17:37.140000 - 0:17:38.860000::It's fucking large and in charge.
0:17:38.860000 - 0:17:39.980000::Yeah, it's electrifying.
0:17:39.980000 - 0:17:41.500000::I got the coke baggy.
0:17:41.500000 - 0:17:42.700000::I got the picture.
0:17:42.700000 - 0:17:46.100000::I should look at the tiny little baggy.
0:17:46.100000 - 0:17:48.020000::Oh, I thought you meant like a whole ziploc bag.
0:17:48.020000 - 0:17:48.860000::No, no, no, no.
0:17:48.860000 - 0:17:49.700000::A big flag.
0:17:49.700000 - 0:17:51.420000::I was just thinking of a can you imagine that?
0:17:51.420000 - 0:17:52.540000::Who do you think has a?
0:17:53.540000 - 0:17:56.860000::Remember when those coke machines came out in about 2010
0:17:56.860000 - 0:18:00.180000::and it was like, you can have, it's like a big,
0:18:00.180000 - 0:18:02.980000::like looks like a vending machine and has every soda
0:18:02.980000 - 0:18:05.780000::and you can put, make it cherry and vanilla.
0:18:05.780000 - 0:18:07.540000::You're talking about fountain soda?
0:18:07.540000 - 0:18:09.180000::Where you can put a ton of greeners?
0:18:09.180000 - 0:18:10.020000::Yes.
0:18:10.020000 - 0:18:12.340000::And you can make it any flavor like raspberry coke.
0:18:12.340000 - 0:18:13.740000::Yeah, ginger.
0:18:13.740000 - 0:18:14.660000::Yes.
0:18:14.660000 - 0:18:15.340000::I love.
0:18:15.340000 - 0:18:17.100000::Well, I remember it was 2010.
0:18:17.100000 - 0:18:18.500000::I'm going freshman in college.
0:18:18.500000 - 0:18:21.820000::I was like, this shit's going to change the fucking world.
0:18:23.140000 - 0:18:25.580000::And it didn't know it.
0:18:25.580000 - 0:18:27.740000::I thought it did a little.
0:18:27.740000 - 0:18:32.940000::I think it was a revolution in the soft drink tech world.
0:18:32.940000 - 0:18:34.380000::Why do they call it soft drink?
0:18:34.380000 - 0:18:36.580000::They should call them hard drinks or bubbly drinks.
0:18:36.580000 - 0:18:38.580000::Because hard drinks are alcohol, man.
0:18:38.580000 - 0:18:41.420000::All right, well, then they should call those poisonous drinks.
0:18:41.420000 - 0:18:44.180000::Dude, or if I can't go after alcohol.
0:18:44.180000 - 0:18:45.180000::Do not judge alcohol.
0:18:45.180000 - 0:18:46.340000::I bought so many of these beers
0:18:46.340000 - 0:18:47.820000::because I thought we were going to be crushing these beers.
0:18:47.820000 - 0:18:49.460000::I can't even take another sip, frankly.
0:18:53.540000 - 0:18:55.980000::You can get drunk, man.
0:18:55.980000 - 0:18:57.380000::Beer is a hard one to get drunk.
0:18:57.380000 - 0:18:59.620000::You can get more when you're drunk.
0:18:59.620000 - 0:19:03.620000::We don't like you right in this state right now, you know?

0:26:26.120000 - 0:26:27.160000::I love him every day.
0:26:27.160000 - 0:26:29.640000::We never talk shit about each other.
0:26:29.640000 - 0:26:30.720000::Okay.
0:26:30.720000 - 0:26:32.880000::And she said, I remember this.
0:26:32.880000 - 0:26:34.640000::You were talking with her.
0:26:34.640000 - 0:26:35.640000::Yeah, you were talking with her.
0:26:35.640000 - 0:26:38.560000::How does she know that he doesn't talk shit about her?
0:26:38.560000 - 0:26:41.560000::And she has to just try a big word in relationships
0:26:41.560000 - 0:26:43.960000::as drizzling a ultra-rest.
0:26:45.040000 - 0:26:47.520000::So what a, man, I was looking at you.
0:26:47.520000 - 0:26:50.240000::And she was telling us the story about how they met.
0:26:50.240000 - 0:26:54.480000::And I'll tell you what, in the scene, I had a beard.
0:26:54.480000 - 0:26:55.320000::Okay.
0:26:55.320000 - 0:26:57.280000::I had a big beard.
0:26:57.280000 - 0:26:59.960000::And then I had to go shave it for continuity purposes
0:26:59.960000 - 0:27:01.320000::for the next scene.
0:27:01.320000 - 0:27:03.880000::And when I had the beard, she was like, oh my God,
0:27:03.880000 - 0:27:05.080000::you are handsome.
0:27:05.080000 - 0:27:07.520000::She was like, you look just like my husband did.
0:27:07.520000 - 0:27:09.280000::And that's 70 days, whatever.
0:27:09.280000 - 0:27:10.880000::And then, and she's been so nice to me.
0:27:10.880000 - 0:27:14.360000::And then I shaved and I can see her go like, ooh.
0:27:14.360000 - 0:27:15.840000::Oh.
0:27:15.840000 - 0:27:18.600000::Like, ooh, where did that beard go?
0:27:18.600000 - 0:27:21.400000::Well, what I'm determining from that story
0:27:21.400000 - 0:27:22.880000::is that she likes the beard.
0:27:23.880000 - 0:27:26::Is that, yeah, dude, that's,
0:27:26 - 0:27:28.720000::I mean, that's basically exactly what I was going for.
0:27:28.720000 - 0:27:30.040000::Wow, that's crazy.
0:27:30.040000 - 0:27:31.280000::Thank you for that.
0:27:33.720000 - 0:27:36.640000::Sorry, I was just worried about the audio levels.
0:27:36.640000 - 0:27:38.400000::Is it too low?
0:27:38.400000 - 0:27:40.520000::I think we are, for some reason, this is,
0:27:40.520000 - 0:27:42.680000::again, we don't have our team here right now.
0:27:42.680000 - 0:27:46.520000::We, and we're doing this ourselves.
0:27:46.520000 - 0:27:48.840000::So I think it's fine.
0:27:48.840000 - 0:27:50.240000::I think that's 100% fine.
0:27:50.240000 - 0:27:51.240000::Okay, actually.
0:27:52.240000 - 0:27:55.280000::When was the first time you guys fell in love?
0:27:55.280000 - 0:27:58.200000::Were you guys, were you guys from young children?
0:27:58.200000 - 0:28:02.200000::That, like, you know, that young love, that elementary school,
0:28:02.200000 - 0:28:03.800000::that's when love is fun.

0:28:24.320000 - 0:28:25.160000::What the hell?
0:28:25.160000 - 0:28:26.800000::That's so fun to me.
0:28:26.800000 - 0:28:28.120000::Well, we were young.
0:28:30.040000 - 0:28:32.720000::But, to your back then, when I say I was in love,
0:28:32.720000 - 0:28:33.960000::I would.
0:28:33.960000 - 0:28:34.800000::Yeah.
0:28:34.800000 - 0:28:37.440000::I would say I would say I've been in love
0:28:37.440000 - 0:28:39.920000::and everyone on my relationships.
0:28:39.920000 - 0:28:42.920000::And because how do you define love?
0:28:42.920000 - 0:28:47.640000::You know, it's a feeling of, well,
0:28:47.640000 - 0:28:48.480000::I can define it.
0:28:48.480000 - 0:28:49.600000::I can define love.
0:28:49.600000 - 0:28:51.840000::A love means that you,
0:28:51.840000 - 0:28:55::if you can get along every single second with this person,
0:28:55 - 0:28:56.200000::you never fight.
0:28:56.200000 - 0:28:58.280000::You would fucking murder yourself.
0:28:58.280000 - 0:28:59.520000::And a million other people will know
0:28:59.520000 - 0:29:02.240000::crap that's setting just to protect them,
0:29:02.240000 - 0:29:04.960000::to put on another five minutes onto their life.
0:29:04.960000 - 0:29:05.480000::Right.
0:29:05.480000 - 0:29:07.600000::It's pure if you ever feel any anger
0:29:07.600000 - 0:29:09.280000::or any sort of disappointment in them.
0:29:09.280000 - 0:29:10.640000::It's not love.
0:29:10.640000 - 0:29:11.760000::It's fucking over.
0:29:11.760000 - 0:29:12.920000::Yeah.
0:29:12.920000 - 0:29:15.280000::That's not love is just pure unconditional.
0:29:15.280000 - 0:29:17.120000::Always happiness.
0:29:17.120000 - 0:29:18::Pure fun.
0:29:18 - 0:29:18.600000::Enjoy.
0:29:18.600000 - 0:29:22.880000::I think love is too complex of a feeling
0:29:22.880000 - 0:29:27.520000::to be deduced into a vocabulary word.
0:29:27.520000 - 0:29:29.560000::Because it's just a word, okay?
0:29:29.560000 - 0:29:32.760000::But the feeling, it means so many different things.
0:29:32.760000 - 0:29:35.200000::It can, there's a spectrum of love.
0:29:35.200000 - 0:29:37.880000::There's the love that you have for a friend,
0:29:37.880000 - 0:29:41.240000::for a family member, but it's all under the umbrella
0:29:41.240000 - 0:29:42.880000::of this oral letter word.
0:29:42.880000 - 0:29:45.360000::Well, well, well, well,
0:29:45.360000 - 0:29:49.520000::there's clearly a way to sort of describe it.
0:29:49.520000 - 0:29:52.880000::Maybe perhaps not with a vocab word, singular.
0:29:52.880000 - 0:29:55.560000::But I think what it is is,
0:29:55.560000 - 0:29:59.600000::when you have a relationship with a person placed thing

0:30:00 - 0:30:06.100000::other as I was saying now and that relationship becomes significant to you
0:30:06.100000 - 0:30:15::emotionally to the point where you are circumvent
0:30:15 - 0:30:26.280000::L
0:30:26.280000 - 0:30:33.260000::You want to tweet with the video trailer and now we Councillor
0:30:36.460000 - 0:30:40.220000::right now.
0:30:40.220000 - 0:30:42.260000::I need it. I need some love.
0:30:45.760000 - 0:30:46.760000::This is love.
0:30:46.760000 - 0:30:47.860000::This is the air.
0:30:47.860000 - 0:30:48.700000::It's love bomb.
0:30:48.700000 - 0:30:49.800000::And you're going to feel that sort of
0:30:49.800000 - 0:30:52.200000::good.
0:30:52.200000 - 0:30:54.160000::Oh, you're trying to send energy right now.
0:30:56.160000 - 0:30:57.640000::You're just putting that as hand and like
0:30:57.640000 - 0:30:59.640000::shook a little bit towards me.
0:30:59.640000 - 0:31:02.840000::Yeah, you know, honestly, let me just be silent and just
0:31:02.840000 - 0:31:04.880000::kind of just tell just I'm not going to look at you.
0:31:04.880000 - 0:31:05.920000::I'm just going to be good.
0:31:07.920000 - 0:31:08.680000::Yeah.
0:31:08.680000 - 0:31:09.680000::Yep.
0:31:09.680000 - 0:31:10.680000::Yeah.
0:31:10.680000 - 0:31:13.480000::Yeah, I could feel it.
0:31:13.480000 - 0:31:15.960000::You guys ever hear about Ricky?
0:31:15.960000 - 0:31:16.480000::Yes.
0:31:16.480000 - 0:31:18.640000::Is that the life of him?
0:31:18.640000 - 0:31:23.680000::Have you seen people do like energetic orgasms?
0:31:23.680000 - 0:31:27.520000::They're like putting their hand like over your like
0:31:27.520000 - 0:31:28.520000::crotch and like.
0:31:28.520000 - 0:31:32.200000::I'm like, he bows on when I do that.
0:31:32.200000 - 0:31:34.240000::Yeah, I felt it from over fucking here.
0:31:34.240000 - 0:31:37::No.
0:31:37 - 0:31:39.240000::That's how they do in Dragon Ball.
0:31:39.240000 - 0:31:41.560000::Can you imagine if there was just one person on the planet
0:31:41.560000 - 0:31:43.880000::who had his kind of that ability to making that from across
0:31:43.880000 - 0:31:44.880000::the room?
0:31:44.880000 - 0:31:45.880000::Oh, shit.
0:31:45.880000 - 0:31:46.880000::I'll tell you what to.
0:31:46.880000 - 0:31:48.200000::I just call it pornography.
0:31:48.200000 - 0:31:49.200000::Yeah.
0:31:49.200000 - 0:31:51.120000::I personally is Riley Reed for Nate.
0:31:51.120000 - 0:31:55.800000::I don't know what that is, man.
0:31:55.800000 - 0:31:58.400000::I just do have a look at it.
0:31:58.400000 - 0:31:59.560000::Oh, dude.
0:31:59.560000 - 0:32:00.800000::Don't even jump out of a look.
0:32:00.800000 - 0:32:01.800000::I don't know.
0:32:01.800000 - 0:32:03.040000::All right.
0:32:03.040000 - 0:32:03.800000::What was I?
0:32:03.800000 - 0:32:04.800000::I think the same.
0:32:04.800000 - 0:32:05.560000::I was going to.
0:32:05.560000 - 0:32:06.360000::I should have had.
0:32:06.400000 - 0:32:08.800000::The only thing is I was saying about the people I love
0:32:08.800000 - 0:32:11.200000::and everything, but there's no love that I have that like
0:32:11.200000 - 0:32:14.760000::for my dog.
0:32:14.760000 - 0:32:15.440000::OK?
0:32:15.440000 - 0:32:16.320000::You don't love your dog.
0:32:16.320000 - 0:32:18.640000::No, I love my dog like crazy.
0:32:18.640000 - 0:32:20.200000::But there's no but.
0:32:20.200000 - 0:32:24.520000::I'm just saying that feels like a super pure love to me.
0:32:24.520000 - 0:32:25.040000::Pure.
0:32:25.040000 - 0:32:25.520000::Right.
0:32:25.520000 - 0:32:26.080000::Right.
0:32:26.080000 - 0:32:29.440000::Love because you care about them.
0:32:29.440000 - 0:32:30.760000::Yeah.
0:32:30.760000 - 0:32:31.840000::Basically, dude.
0:32:31.840000 - 0:32:32.560000::And then that shall.
0:32:32.560000 - 0:32:37::Do you need love or can that should go with the birds?
0:32:37 - 0:32:37.840000::I fucking need it.
0:32:37.840000 - 0:32:38.680000::I know.
0:32:38.680000 - 0:32:39.280000::Absolutely.
0:32:39.280000 - 0:32:41::You'll die without love.
0:32:41 - 0:32:41.760000::Why, though?
0:32:41.760000 - 0:32:42.760000::You'll pay for it.
0:32:42.760000 - 0:32:44.840000::You'll pay for adoration and respect.
0:32:44.840000 - 0:32:46.240000::Why does it have to be deeper?
0:32:46.240000 - 0:32:47.760000::Why does it have to be more significant?
0:32:47.760000 - 0:32:49.240000::Why can't you rather be the surface?
0:32:49.240000 - 0:32:54::Would you rather be powerful yet, feared?
0:32:54 - 0:32:56.560000::What was this question?
0:32:56.560000 - 0:32:58.440000::Or power less?
0:32:58.440000 - 0:32:59.960000::Quite loved.
0:32:59.960000 - 0:33:02.440000::It's like would you rather be hot and broke?
0:33:02.960000 - 0:33:05.040000::Or rich and poor?
0:33:05.040000 - 0:33:07.960000::I would rather be hot and fucking broke.
0:33:07.960000 - 0:33:12.280000::Hot and broke or rich and fucking fucked.
0:33:12.280000 - 0:33:13.480000::Really, it's fun.
0:33:13.480000 - 0:33:15.440000::Are we talking fuckly?
0:33:15.440000 - 0:33:19.320000::We're talking fucking Martin's Grilly's style.
0:33:19.320000 - 0:33:20.360000::What are you gonna ask?
0:33:20.360000 - 0:33:22.040000::OK.
0:33:22.040000 - 0:33:23.520000::Martin's Grilly, ugly?
0:33:23.520000 - 0:33:24.200000::Yeah.
0:33:24.200000 - 0:33:28.520000::I would be Martin's Grilly ugly for a bill.
0:33:28.520000 - 0:33:30.320000::What?
0:33:30.320000 - 0:33:33.520000::Well, there's a way to do that, unfortunately.
0:33:33.520000 - 0:33:34.240000::Right.
0:33:34.240000 - 0:33:35.240000::He's a criminal.
0:33:35.240000 - 0:33:35.920000::He is a criminal.
0:33:35.920000 - 0:33:39.120000::I want to take Martin's Grilly's hand and grab onto it
0:33:39.120000 - 0:33:41.560000::and tie a chain around it on the back of a pickup truck
0:33:41.560000 - 0:33:43.240000::and rip his arm off.
0:33:43.240000 - 0:33:45.120000::As such, it's so gentle.
0:33:45.120000 - 0:33:47.960000::Well, it's a great hand and healthy.
0:33:47.960000 - 0:33:51.240000::That's how I laugh at it.
0:33:51.240000 - 0:33:52.920000::Good god.
0:33:52.920000 - 0:33:54.760000::So you think people are driving escalators
0:33:54.760000 - 0:33:56::and do this right now?
0:33:56 - 0:33:59.440000::Nate, move your knee with us like this.
0:33:59.440000 - 0:34:00.880000::This is nice.
0:34:00.880000 - 0:34:03.680000::And this is so fun.
0:34:03.680000 - 0:34:04.520000::I got that water.
0:34:04.520000 - 0:34:06.280000::Oh, here's what I wanted to say.
0:34:06.280000 - 0:34:09.080000::Here's what I wanted to say.
0:34:09.080000 - 0:34:14.600000::I think that people use the word the world needs more love.
0:34:14.600000 - 0:34:16.120000::You know, people's like the Beatles.
0:34:16.120000 - 0:34:17.280000::All the world, man.
0:34:17.280000 - 0:34:23.200000::Like, I think that is such a, I think people
0:34:23.200000 - 0:34:25.160000::need more specificity than that.
0:34:25.160000 - 0:34:27.760000::Like, I feel like that is a cop out to be like,
0:34:27.760000 - 0:34:30.880000::man, I feel like we just need more love in America
0:34:30.880000 - 0:34:33.040000::and people just need to love each other.
0:34:33.040000 - 0:34:37.240000::And I'm like, that doesn't, that we're not rocking
0:34:37.240000 - 0:34:38.520000::with that message anymore.
0:34:38.520000 - 0:34:39.200000::We need more.
0:34:39.200000 - 0:34:40.480000::You know what needs to change?
0:34:40.480000 - 0:34:41.480000::What?
0:34:41.480000 - 0:34:42.480000::The policies need to be given to us.
0:34:42.480000 - 0:34:43.480000::No, no, no.
0:34:43.480000 - 0:34:45.200000::No, I'm getting into it, man.
0:34:45.200000 - 0:34:46.520000::I'm talking about policy.
0:34:46.520000 - 0:34:51.120000::I'm talking about domestic policy.
0:34:51.120000 - 0:34:52.400000::All types of policy, man.
0:34:52.400000 - 0:34:54.160000::I know all about that shit.
0:34:54.160000 - 0:34:56.480000::Can I just say this love isn't what we thought
0:34:56.480000 - 0:34:58.560000::was when we were five.
0:34:58.560000 - 0:35:00.560000::Well, there's a crazy car.

0:35:00 - 0:35:04.140000::Are they playing ski?
0:35:04.140000 - 0:35:07.740000::You showed me ski, Nate.
0:35:07.740000 - 0:35:08.740000::I did?
0:35:08.740000 - 0:35:09.740000::What is ski red?
0:35:09.740000 - 0:35:10.740000::That was sexy red?
0:35:10.740000 - 0:35:11.740000::Oh, sexy red.
0:35:11.740000 - 0:35:14.240000::Shout out to sexy red best.
0:35:14.240000 - 0:35:18.180000::Okay, but what I was going to say is, by the way, very profound.
0:35:18.180000 - 0:35:21.300000::When we were about eight, ten years old, I thought love is, kiss, kiss.
0:35:21.300000 - 0:35:22.300000::I love you.
0:35:22.300000 - 0:35:23.300000::I really love you.
0:35:23.300000 - 0:35:24.300000::I love, guess what?
0:35:24.300000 - 0:35:25.300000::That's MG.
0:35:25.300000 - 0:35:27.300000::You know what love is?
0:35:27.700000 - 0:35:32.300000::Love is fucking, you get home tired as fuck, your partner realizes it.
0:35:32.300000 - 0:35:36.640000::And it's your day to do the fucking, I love the dishwasher on the short chart.
0:35:36.640000 - 0:35:39.360000::And your partner just does it without saying word.
0:35:39.360000 - 0:35:40.360000::And then I look for you.
0:35:40.360000 - 0:35:42.160000::I can't, I cannot do that.
0:35:42.160000 - 0:35:48.360000::Like if I do something like, it's so hard for me not to want credit for.
0:35:48.360000 - 0:35:49.360000::You know what I'm saying?
0:35:49.360000 - 0:35:50.360000::Yeah.
0:35:50.360000 - 0:35:52.400000::Like, can you take out the trash?
0:35:52.400000 - 0:35:56.640000::Like, when you weren't supposed to take out the trash, like, and,
0:35:56.640000 - 0:35:58.640000::just not saying anything about it.
0:35:58.640000 - 0:36:03.640000::I got one in me, and then if I do one little ounce more than that, I'm like,
0:36:03.640000 - 0:36:05.640000::I'm like, I'm fucking, but I know we're back with you.
0:36:05.640000 - 0:36:10.640000::It's not that I'm like, I have to be like, you know what, I just like,

0:36:28.640000 - 0:36:30.640000::So you need fucking validation, man.
0:36:30.640000 - 0:36:35.640000::I need validation, yeah, for my good deeds, which is fucked up.
0:36:35.640000 - 0:36:37.640000::No, no, no, I'll say this.
0:36:37.640000 - 0:36:41.640000::I volunteered, and I didn't tell until now.
0:36:41.640000 - 0:36:43.640000::Until now, I'm not.
0:36:43.640000 - 0:36:44.640000::I'm not.
0:36:44.640000 - 0:36:45.640000::I'm not.
0:36:45.640000 - 0:36:47.640000::So listen, where did you volunteer, man?
0:36:47.640000 - 0:36:52.640000::I volunteered for the, for like, an agency.
0:36:52.640000 - 0:36:54.640000::An agency.
0:36:54.640000 - 0:36:59.640000::That was like, uh, uh, where homeless people come and they get a meal and you get them
0:36:59.640000 - 0:37:04.640000::some clothes and like, little hygiene kits and, oh, that's nice.
0:37:04.640000 - 0:37:05.640000::It's helping out.
0:37:05.640000 - 0:37:06.640000::Yeah, helping out.
0:37:06.640000 - 0:37:07.640000::You want to buy your rail?
0:37:07.640000 - 0:37:09.640000::Do you want to buy myself?
0:37:09.640000 - 0:37:10.640000::Yeah, I'm signing up.
0:37:10.640000 - 0:37:11.640000::That's awesome.
0:37:11.640000 - 0:37:13.640000::Did everybody listening out there take out who?
0:37:13.640000 - 0:37:18.640000::I'm a little too busy right now to basically be doing shit like that, but basically,
0:37:18.640000 - 0:37:19.640000::yeah, me too.
0:37:19.640000 - 0:37:23.640000::I made time because I, because I want to help out Mike Mead, me, I like you.
0:37:23.640000 - 0:37:25.640000::What's the last time you bought here?
0:37:25.640000 - 0:37:27.640000::Have you ever been to volunteer?
0:37:27.640000 - 0:37:33.640000::Yeah, I actually bought here with old-ass people.
0:37:33.640000 - 0:37:34.640000::That's right.
0:37:34.640000 - 0:37:40.640000::You did a warm call, little brothers, where you are a little brother to isolated elder and my elder.
0:37:40.640000 - 0:37:43.640000::Oh, I'm already starting to understand that when I'm old.
0:37:43.640000 - 0:37:44.640000::Oh, Mike.
0:37:44.640000 - 0:37:52.640000::I don't think, well, poor Bernard was my friend and, uh, why, what, what for?
0:37:52.640000 - 0:37:53.640000::Because he got stuck with you.
0:37:53.640000 - 0:37:57.640000::And I actually, that was one of his biggest women followers.
0:37:57.640000 - 0:37:58.640000::It's against that with me.
0:37:58.640000 - 0:38:00.640000::That was a blessing for him.
0:38:00.640000 - 0:38:01.640000::Oh, but there's so much.
0:38:01.640000 - 0:38:02.640000::And guess what?
0:38:02.640000 - 0:38:07.640000::The boomers, there's so many of them, there's not enough infrastructure for their retirement homes.
0:38:07.640000 - 0:38:10.640000::We're going to have an old people looking crisis.
0:38:10.640000 - 0:38:11.640000::Oh, God.
0:38:11.640000 - 0:38:15.640000::It's going to be worse than you can imagine because the boomers at least, you know, some of them have pensions,
0:38:15.640000 - 0:38:20.640000::a lot of them have social security, whatever it's called, and also just, uh, when we are at that age,
0:38:20.640000 - 0:38:23.640000::we are going to need to be strapped up to the fucking nine.
0:38:23.640000 - 0:38:28.640000::So the fucking teeth, they better have some of the chip of fucking drug we can get addicted to.
0:38:28.640000 - 0:38:29.640000::Better.
0:38:29.640000 - 0:38:33.640000::No, you know, I don't mean to say that flippantly because drug addiction is not.
0:38:33.640000 - 0:38:36.640000::Yeah, we need like some song that's like nicotine adjacent.
0:38:36.640000 - 0:38:38.640000::Yeah, like some like that.
0:38:38.640000 - 0:38:40.640000::Or some type of patch we can, yeah, exactly.
0:38:40.640000 - 0:38:42.640000::Or some IV thing.
0:38:42.640000 - 0:38:43.640000::Does it kill you just as much?
0:38:43.640000 - 0:38:44.640000::Is that what we need?
0:38:44.640000 - 0:38:45.640000::No, I didn't kill you.
0:38:45.640000 - 0:38:46.640000::It's not even bad for you.
0:38:46.640000 - 0:38:47.640000::It's just addictive.
0:38:47.640000 - 0:38:48.640000::It's just crazy.
0:38:48.640000 - 0:38:49.640000::It's really.
0:38:49.640000 - 0:38:50.640000::You're even feeling it.
0:38:50.640000 - 0:38:54.640000::It's just, but it's, I feel like that's could be darts.
0:38:54.640000 - 0:38:55.640000::Yeah, I get pretty addicted.
0:38:55.640000 - 0:38:56.640000::Like when I'm on that.
0:38:56.640000 - 0:38:57.640000::No, no, no, no.
0:38:57.640000 - 0:39:00.640000::Just that's what it's like when someone calls a cigarette a dart.
0:39:00.640000 - 0:39:02.640000::When I'm having a job.
0:39:02.640000 - 0:39:09.640000::You guys want to bet on how you guys know I'm like, uh, addicted to nicotine and, or used to be,
0:39:09.640000 - 0:39:12.640000::but I still takes in my mind.
0:39:12.640000 - 0:39:15.640000::Yeah, that's how addicted nicotine is.
0:39:15.640000 - 0:39:22.640000::So if you haven't smoked cigarettes or been, you know, vape drink, I just don't do it.
0:39:22.640000 - 0:39:28.640000::Because I haven't smoked or vaped in five or six years, something like that.
0:39:28.640000 - 0:39:30.640000::And I think about it every day.
0:39:30.640000 - 0:39:37.640000::And literally my girlfriend just was like, just walked over and was like, what are you looking
0:39:37.640000 - 0:39:38.640000::at?
0:39:38.640000 - 0:39:41.640000::And on my computer, I was looking up Zinn packets.
0:39:41.640000 - 0:39:46.640000::Oh, just to see how much they were in like the milligrams of them.
0:39:46.640000 - 0:39:51.640000::Because I was some, some, some person I know was like chewing on some Zinn recently.
0:39:51.640000 - 0:39:53.640000::And I was like, damn those look at you.
0:39:53.640000 - 0:39:55.640000::Was that cable?
0:39:55.640000 - 0:39:58.640000::No, no, Andy.
0:39:58.640000 - 0:39:59.640000::He was.

0:40:00 - 0:40:03.680000::But he was just chewing on my plastic.
0:40:03.680000 - 0:40:05.440000::Yeah, I was like, damn.
0:40:05.440000 - 0:40:06.440000::I don't know.
0:40:06.440000 - 0:40:07.280000::I don't know.
0:40:07.280000 - 0:40:08.280000::You put them in your mouth.
0:40:08.280000 - 0:40:09.280000::That's it.
0:40:09.280000 - 0:40:11.600000::Yeah, you put, I tried it a long time at dinner,
0:40:11.600000 - 0:40:13.680000::and it set me to the fucking moon.
0:40:13.680000 - 0:40:15.080000::You had a little bit of it?
0:40:15.080000 - 0:40:16.480000::No, it scared me, man.
0:40:16.480000 - 0:40:18.520000::Well, a lot of people sleep at those end.
0:40:18.520000 - 0:40:20.680000::Tucker Carlson, Tucker Carlson.
0:40:20.680000 - 0:40:23.320000::I'm like, I'm just gonna do what?
0:40:23.320000 - 0:40:24.880000::Should I get back on the nicotine?
0:40:24.880000 - 0:40:26.120000::But anyways, oh, by your way,
0:40:26.120000 - 0:40:28.760000::so I was looking up Zin pouches online,
0:40:28.760000 - 0:40:32.520000::and I had a fucking TikTok that was talking
0:40:32.520000 - 0:40:35.280000::about nicotine on my phone.
0:40:35.280000 - 0:40:37.960000::Literally, I made a mother nicotine addicted person.
0:40:37.960000 - 0:40:40.560000::I might do it like, if I like nicotine that much,
0:40:40.560000 - 0:40:41.880000::I should probably have it, right?
0:40:41.880000 - 0:40:43.080000::Like I should be on the gun.
0:40:43.080000 - 0:40:44.400000::There's no question.
0:40:44.400000 - 0:40:47.200000::Some of those things are not bad for you.
0:40:47.200000 - 0:40:48.760000::Like you might be too sure.
0:40:48.760000 - 0:40:50.600000::You think you're addicted to me?
0:40:50.600000 - 0:40:51.880000::Yeah, because on a constantly.
0:40:51.880000 - 0:40:53.600000::And you were in this like nicotine's actually.
0:40:53.600000 - 0:40:54.440000::Exactly.
0:40:54.440000 - 0:40:55.600000::I was working on that.
0:40:55.600000 - 0:40:56.760000::I was watching.
0:40:56.760000 - 0:40:57.960000::He probably had a re-indicted cell.
0:40:57.960000 - 0:41:01.800000::You were mean was like, he was talking about,
0:41:01.800000 - 0:41:04.400000::I don't know, like, the gum or something like that.
0:41:04.400000 - 0:41:07.720000::It's funny because if you're addicted to like addiction,
0:41:07.720000 - 0:41:10.480000::your body is craving something, right?
0:41:10.480000 - 0:41:13.480000::But there's a point where we call it an addiction why?
0:41:13.480000 - 0:41:15.560000::Because it's bad for you or what?
0:41:15.560000 - 0:41:17.160000::So what if it's not bad for you?
0:41:17.160000 - 0:41:18.200000::Are you addicted to food?
0:41:18.200000 - 0:41:20.560000::Because everyone, you crave food when you're hungry?
0:41:20.560000 - 0:41:21.720000::Are you addicted to connection?
0:41:21.720000 - 0:41:23.600000::Because when you're lonely, you wanna go to sleep,
0:41:23.600000 - 0:41:24.920000::and you're like, that's a good point.
0:41:24.920000 - 0:41:28.800000::If there's nothing bad about a nicotine for you,
0:41:28.800000 - 0:41:31.120000::then that's what I wanted to get out of the kitchen.
0:41:31.120000 - 0:41:33.360000::I'm not addicted to anything else in this world.
0:41:33.360000 - 0:41:35.560000::Maybe coffee, but that's just like.
0:41:35.560000 - 0:41:37.800000::And you have a fucking crippling sex addiction.
0:41:37.800000 - 0:41:39.920000::Well, that's weird.
0:41:39.920000 - 0:41:42.880000::I told you guys in many times I don't wanna talk about
0:41:42.880000 - 0:41:44.960000::the podcast, and here we are.
0:41:44.960000 - 0:41:45.800000::You have to.
0:41:45.800000 - 0:41:46.640000::And here we are.
0:41:46.640000 - 0:41:48.400000::Sex addiction is one of the funniest.
0:41:48.400000 - 0:41:49.400000::Yeah.
0:41:49.400000 - 0:41:50.560000::It's not for you.
0:41:50.560000 - 0:41:51.400000::Yeah.
0:41:51.400000 - 0:41:52.400000::Yeah.
0:41:52.400000 - 0:41:53.400000::It's not.
0:41:53.400000 - 0:41:54.400000::It's a sex addiction.
0:41:54.400000 - 0:41:55.240000::Oh, sorry.
0:41:55.240000 - 0:41:56.240000::That is fucking funny.
0:41:56.240000 - 0:41:57.240000::I mean, I'm gonna do this.
0:41:57.240000 - 0:41:58.240000::Sex.
0:41:58.240000 - 0:41:59.240000::Oh, I'm not.
0:41:59.240000 - 0:42:00.240000::I'm supposed to do y'all serious.
0:42:00.240000 - 0:42:01.240000::I'm not.
0:42:01.240000 - 0:42:03.240000::You fucking loser.
0:42:03.240000 - 0:42:05.240000::Yeah, you want that?
0:42:05.240000 - 0:42:06.240000::I'm a loser.
0:42:06.240000 - 0:42:10.240000::I feel like I have a bit of a, kind of a meta narrative
0:42:10.240000 - 0:42:13.240000::going on with my character on George Tagzoo's.
0:42:13.240000 - 0:42:15.240000::What does that, what do you mean by that?
0:42:15.240000 - 0:42:17.240000::I mean, slowly over the last couple podcasts,
0:42:17.240000 - 0:42:19.240000::I'm getting more and more tired.
0:42:19.240000 - 0:42:20.240000::Yeah.
0:42:20.240000 - 0:42:22.240000::We might have underlying disease.

0:42:23.240000 - 0:42:24.240000::I do that one.
0:42:24.240000 - 0:42:25.240000::I do that one.
0:42:25.240000 - 0:42:26.240000::I do that one.
0:42:26.240000 - 0:42:27.240000::I do that one.
0:42:27.240000 - 0:42:28.240000::It's called Boney Fingers.

0:42:32.240000 - 0:42:33.240000::No.
0:42:33.240000 - 0:42:38.240000::So if you're okay, so I wanna know and I'll pull in the comments,

0:43:20.240000 - 0:43:21.240000::Right.
0:43:21.240000 - 0:43:22.240000::Every radio web series that's gonna be my way.
0:43:22.240000 - 0:43:24.240000::And it's back in my spirit back.
0:43:24.240000 - 0:43:27.240000::There is documenting tunnels and highways and Southwestern.
0:43:27.240000 - 0:43:32.240000::You know what?
0:43:32.240000 - 0:43:34.240000::I think I might talk about this yet.
0:43:34.240000 - 0:43:38.240000::My one of my favorite videos online, which is the LA Beast.
0:43:38.240000 - 0:43:40.240000::Going to Brazil to do that.
0:43:40.240000 - 0:43:41.240000::I watched Chris Armani.
0:43:41.240000 - 0:43:42.240000::Yeah.
0:43:42.240000 - 0:43:44.240000::When he puts the hands in the hand.
0:43:44.240000 - 0:43:45.240000::Oh my gosh.
0:43:45.240000 - 0:43:48.240000::I need experience his intense, intense crazy ass pain.
0:43:48.240000 - 0:43:49.240000::Yeah.
0:43:49.240000 - 0:43:52.240000::That's what I need to do to get my mental rate.
0:43:52.240000 - 0:43:55.240000::I would love to watch a video of you sweating out of your mind,
0:43:55.240000 - 0:43:56.240000::highs, health, tripping, visually.
0:43:56.240000 - 0:43:57.240000::Get in bit by bulletins.
0:43:57.240000 - 0:44:01.240000::And put a two of them into bulletins in them.
0:44:01.240000 - 0:44:02.240000::Oh my gosh.
0:44:02.240000 - 0:44:04.240000::That's an interesting idea actually for a YouTube channel.
0:44:04.240000 - 0:44:10.240000::If you made something called like the Eric Beast, and you are doing like a basically a shop for shop remake.
0:44:10.240000 - 0:44:13.240000::But like a video for video remake of someone else's YouTube channel.
0:44:13.240000 - 0:44:16.240000::The worst thing I've ever seen him do is eat all that fucking butter.
0:44:16.240000 - 0:44:18.240000::But I don't care about that.
0:44:18.240000 - 0:44:20.240000::What about the one where he puts the pizza?
0:44:20.240000 - 0:44:25.240000::There's a video input and pizza is in a blender and trying to break the world record for you to pizza by.
0:44:25.240000 - 0:44:28.240000::Lending it all down to a juice.
0:44:28.240000 - 0:44:32.240000::And then putting it in a vacuum cleaner and like force.
0:44:32.240000 - 0:44:33.240000::Oh yeah.
0:44:33.240000 - 0:44:35.240000::Winning on.
0:44:35.240000 - 0:44:37.240000::It wouldn't get the record on technicality.
0:44:37.240000 - 0:44:38.240000::Wait, he was a step.
0:44:38.240000 - 0:44:39.240000::Yeah.
0:44:39.240000 - 0:44:40.240000::What?
0:44:40.240000 - 0:44:42.240000::I mean, it's not a good one.
0:44:42.240000 - 0:44:43.240000::What is it?
0:44:43.240000 - 0:44:48.240000::Just if you wanted to break the record for the fastest time eating a whole pizza.
0:44:48.240000 - 0:44:52.240000::If they just put you unconscious and sliced just I'm going to go up it and then just put it in.
0:44:52.240000 - 0:44:55.240000::Oh, it's like, how damn well.
0:44:55.240000 - 0:44:58.240000::You realize your teeth are the first part of the digestion.
0:44:58.240000 - 0:44:59.240000::So are they?

0:45:00 - 0:45:02::I think that's the first thing I do.
0:45:02 - 0:45:04::The first thing is spin, because I spin all over the food
0:45:04 - 0:45:06::and make all the munchy firsts.
0:45:06 - 0:45:08::Don't blow me right now.
0:45:08 - 0:45:10::Don't play about it.
0:45:10 - 0:45:12::So that was like, is that what?
0:45:12 - 0:45:14::You know what?
0:45:14 - 0:45:16::I fucking love pizza.
0:45:16 - 0:45:18::I love pizza too.
0:45:18 - 0:45:20::It's just so fucking good.
0:45:20 - 0:45:22::I just heard about a good pizza, but I can't remember what it was.
0:45:22 - 0:45:24::Best pizza in New York.
0:45:24 - 0:45:26::Mottos.
0:45:26 - 0:45:28::Pizza.
0:45:28 - 0:45:30::That's the best.
0:45:30 - 0:45:34::Would you say that you love pizza?
0:45:34 - 0:45:36::Bringing it back, thank you, man.
0:45:36 - 0:45:38::Yeah, I fucking love pizza.
0:45:38 - 0:45:40::You know, I think, have I said this word?
0:45:40 - 0:45:44::It's just like pizza guy, such a bad rap from about 2013.
0:45:44 - 0:45:48::About 2018, because it became people's personalities who had sticking pokes.
0:45:48 - 0:45:54::And it was like the indie rock of food and then became a laughing stock.
0:45:54 - 0:45:56::But now it's back.
0:45:56 - 0:45:58::We can enjoy it wholeheartedly again.
0:45:58 - 0:46:00::Thank God.
0:46:00 - 0:46:04::I remember thinking, I really love Papa John's growing up.
0:46:04 - 0:46:06::Probably my best pleasure in the world was Papa John.
0:46:06 - 0:46:10::Was eating Papa John's and watching American Idol.
0:46:10 - 0:46:12::Oh, that was the soda.
0:46:12 - 0:46:16::The soda is right next to me, the sprite.
0:46:16 - 0:46:20::Now, I remember when I found out that Papa John wasn't good for you.
0:46:20 - 0:46:22::And the day's gonna come when it'll kill you.
0:46:22 - 0:46:24::Who told you this, man?
0:46:24 - 0:46:26::The... I don't know.
0:46:26 - 0:46:30::Maybe the people say that.
0:46:30 - 0:46:32::It's like Papa Thomas.
0:46:32 - 0:46:34::No, no, no, no, no.
0:46:34 - 0:46:36::People say the pizza's like a food.
0:46:36 - 0:46:38::The fast food pizza, like pizza, Papa John, the ominos, that shit is poison.
0:46:38 - 0:46:40::It's all but it's worth it.
0:46:40 - 0:46:42::It's good. It's delicious.
0:46:42 - 0:46:44::I'm not saying that, but it is.
0:46:44 - 0:46:46::So you're claiming that's an indie rock.
0:46:46 - 0:46:48::You're saying, dude, give me a fucking break.
0:46:48 - 0:46:50::Well, it just...
0:46:50 - 0:46:54::Remember, I had... You guys remember when I got all skinny in Chicago?
0:46:54 - 0:47:00::Yeah, that was directly correlated to I think a domino's pizza that was...
0:47:02 - 0:47:06::I don't know, in my fridge for like a day longer than it should have been.
0:47:06 - 0:47:08::And I was eating it.
0:47:08 - 0:47:14::I think that I had some kind of like bacteria in my stomach that called out.
0:47:14 - 0:47:16::Have to rework my diet.
0:47:16 - 0:47:18::That on top.
0:47:18 - 0:47:20::I think some other things involved it.
0:47:20 - 0:47:28::But I think that was a catalyst that kind of like exploded some sort of gut fucking thing was going down.
0:47:28 - 0:47:32::Where I had to be like, oh shit, I think I need to like change it up, change everything up.
0:47:32 - 0:47:34::Oh, I remember that.
0:47:34 - 0:47:36::I had a moment like that with the...
0:47:36 - 0:47:40::What is it like spin and target show to those dead?
0:47:40 - 0:47:42::I think you can get it.
0:47:42 - 0:47:46::Like I think what I had was basically like symptoms of I've yes, but you can get it from...
0:47:46 - 0:47:48::I've got a...
0:47:48 - 0:47:52::Like spoiled food or something like that.
0:47:52 - 0:47:54::Like we can trigger that in your body.
0:47:54 - 0:47:56::I've heard and I think that's what happened to me.
0:47:56 - 0:47:58::But I beat it now.
0:47:58 - 0:48:00::I beat it in a good job.
0:48:00 - 0:48:02::Yeah, I feel like you got put on pretty...
0:48:02 - 0:48:06::I got put on pretty late in life today idea that food goes bad.
0:48:06 - 0:48:10::Like I thought if it was in the fridge, you're good.
0:48:10 - 0:48:14::Like you could put a fucking chicken carcass in the fridge for a month and just go add it whenever...
0:48:14 - 0:48:16::When it gets all delineated.
0:48:16 - 0:48:20::Okay, question for you guys.
0:48:20 - 0:48:22::Literally question.
0:48:22 - 0:48:24::Okay, so what breaks down apples?
0:48:24 - 0:48:26::Oxygen.
0:48:26 - 0:48:28::Apples?
0:48:28 - 0:48:30::You put an apple in a fucking box.
0:48:30 - 0:48:32::It's fucking hermetically sealed.
0:48:32 - 0:48:34::Whatever.
0:48:34 - 0:48:36::In about a year, that should be broken down.
0:48:36 - 0:48:38::It's broken.
0:48:38 - 0:48:40::It's broken.
0:48:40 - 0:48:42::So are there just bacteria?
0:48:42 - 0:48:44::This must be the answer clearly.
0:48:44 - 0:48:46::There's just bacteria on the apple.
0:48:46 - 0:48:50::And then that bacteria goes crazy and reproduces it if it's around.
0:48:50 - 0:48:52::So, and it's eating the apple?
0:48:52 - 0:48:54::Well, everything behaves.
0:48:54 - 0:48:56::Right, but what is it?
0:48:56 - 0:48:58::That's bacteria eating that shit.
0:48:58 - 0:49:00::So is eating.
0:49:00 - 0:49:02::It's just being eaten.
0:49:02 - 0:49:04::It's not that it's just disappearing right?
0:49:04 - 0:49:06::Right, it's just like a person eating it.
0:49:06 - 0:49:08::But you get it all lit.
0:49:08 - 0:49:10::It's eaten.
0:49:10 - 0:49:12::What did you say?
0:49:12 - 0:49:14::Oh, where are they?
0:49:14 - 0:49:16::I know.
0:49:16 - 0:49:20::I do wish that there was like a little bit of a live chat where we could ask people stuff just to be eaten.
0:49:20 - 0:49:26::We need to get on the, you know what I've been watching a lot of is, you know, Fussi.
0:49:26 - 0:49:28::I have to get loose in there right now.

0:50:07.580000 - 0:50:11.200000::of YouTube and fame and at a certain point,
0:50:11.200000 - 0:50:16.200000::if you're online and making it for like 10 years,
0:50:16.800000 - 0:50:19::you just get put into this category of like,
0:50:19 - 0:50:22.680000::all right, you're kind of like an internet legend,

0:50:26.400000 - 0:50:28.560000::I've been online for the last 10 years,
0:50:28.960000 - 0:50:31.680000::doing fucking bullshit like,

0:51:02.800000 - 0:51:04.120000::I'm going all over the place right now,
0:51:04.120000 - 0:51:07.080000::but I watch this documentary last like called BS High.
0:51:07.080000 - 0:51:08.560000::You have to do this, hell no.
0:51:09.560000 - 0:51:11.480000::Watch it, everyone go watch it.
0:51:11.480000 - 0:51:13.640000::It's about a guy who,
0:51:15.200000 - 0:51:17.240000::he's a high school football coach,
0:51:17.240000 - 0:51:20.800000::and he basically, this sounds like something that like Jack,
0:51:20.800000 - 0:51:23.880000::you would have mentioned on a Joy-Tactics episode,
0:51:23.880000 - 0:51:27.800000::and like just nobody ever,
0:51:28.800000 - 0:51:33.800000::actualized it, but basically what he did was he made up a high school.
0:51:34.520000 - 0:51:38.320000::So there was like, he made up a school that didn't exist
0:51:38.320000 - 0:51:40.680000::in just like how to football team.
0:51:40.680000 - 0:51:42.760000::That was like, it was just a football team,
0:51:42.760000 - 0:51:44.960000::a high school football team with no school.
0:51:44.960000 - 0:51:46.120000::That was good.
0:51:46.120000 - 0:51:48.160000::So all these players,
0:51:48.160000 - 0:51:50.880000::like scammed them all and made them pay like,
0:51:50.880000 - 0:51:52.480000::$17,000,
0:51:52.480000 - 0:51:56.280000::like he got these kids to like take out like these pandemic,
0:51:56.280000 - 0:52:00.560000::P.P.E. loans to pay for the,
0:52:00.560000 - 0:52:03.920000::the football like program,
0:52:03.920000 - 0:52:07.640000::and he like, he's like this crazy like con artist,
0:52:07.640000 - 0:52:10.120000::and that's where I draw the line.
0:52:11.760000 - 0:52:13.080000::If you're a con artist, yeah,
0:52:13.080000 - 0:52:14.720000::give a left, put your children in.
0:52:14.720000 - 0:52:17.480000::Well, okay, so,
0:52:17.480000 - 0:52:18.800000::I mean, he tricks them.
0:52:18.800000 - 0:52:20::He tricks these kids,
0:52:20 - 0:52:21.840000::and they're all like promised like,
0:52:21.840000 - 0:52:26.120000::oh, they're going to get into like all these D1 college
0:52:26.200000 - 0:52:29.760000::football teams and he gets on ESPN.
0:52:29.760000 - 0:52:32.480000::Like he's playing the best football,
0:52:32.480000 - 0:52:34.320000::high school football team in the country,
0:52:34.320000 - 0:52:35.960000::and this is where people are like,
0:52:35.960000 - 0:52:38.480000::wait, who's this, who's this high school?
0:52:38.480000 - 0:52:39.560000::Like we've never heard of them.
0:52:39.560000 - 0:52:41.040000::They're called the Bishop, something,
0:52:41.040000 - 0:52:43.120000::and it was in Columbus, Ohio, where I'm from.
0:52:44.680000 - 0:52:48.720000::And he somehow like, nobody wanted to play this football team
0:52:48.720000 - 0:52:52.320000::because they were so good that he like got in on this like,
0:52:52.320000 - 0:52:56.480000::football, but they lost like 100 to zero.
0:52:56.480000 - 0:53:00.360000::Everybody was like roasting all the players,
0:53:00.360000 - 0:53:01.960000::and that's what I'm saying.
0:53:01.960000 - 0:53:02.960000::Yeah, yeah, yeah.
0:53:02.960000 - 0:53:04.720000::But it's a really good document.

0:53:10.320000 - 0:53:11.720000::This was a creative criminal
0:53:11.720000 - 0:53:14.120000::because he was talking about he would go to,

0:53:24.880000 - 0:53:27.360000::and then come in like 10 minutes before they're closing,
0:53:27.360000 - 0:53:30.720000::and then all of them will be like marked down to like $1.
0:53:30.720000 - 0:53:31.880000::And he would scoop them up.

0:53:39.600000 - 0:53:41.680000::But he did at the very end of the documentary,

0:55:41.760000 - 0:55:49.640000::Like literally 10 minutes after recording and in my mind I should know about generally the topics that we talked about and

0:57:24.480000 - 0:57:29.080000::Fall in love and move to fucking Eric. Here's what you don't want to do. Yeah
0:57:29.840000 - 0:57:35.600000::This net and this is something that you okay do not be yourself
0:57:36.320000 - 0:57:41.720000::Because nobody wants to live where you are right now being you you're not you're no
0:57:42.720000 - 0:57:44.720000::Nothing nobody likes you
0:57:44.720000 - 0:57:46.720000::It's a job for no money

0:57:53.240000 - 0:57:58.640000::So you need to change that and the last thing you want to be is you because no one likes you, okay?
0:57:58.640000 - 0:58:04.160000::You need to be somebody else all right, so be that person and lie to everybody in your life
0:58:04.160000 - 0:58:07.360000::And then when you get home you can just kind of freak out and
0:58:08 - 0:58:10.440000::Whatever but just don't be yourself and
0:58:11.320000 - 0:58:13.080000::Someone will love you
0:58:13.080000 - 0:58:18.080000::They'll they'll fall out of love with you, you know, you're just later, but that's okay
0:58:18.080000 - 0:58:24.120000::You know, and then you can kind of reinvent yourself again and then move on to the expression. You know, and let me give some advice
0:58:27.240000 - 0:58:30.640000::Oh shit Eric is the reason did you just get my head in room? No

0:58:34.960000 - 0:58:41.720000::No one is gonna love you until you love yourself. It sounds like a cliche sounds like something from Oprah
0:58:42.240000 - 0:58:46.200000::But you were not gonna find any but if you find someone before you fall in love with yourself
0:58:46.520000 - 0:58:49.360000::That's not the person for you because it's a falling love with a shell
0:58:49.760000 - 0:58:56.600000::You need to learn what's good about yourself. You need to find deep connection to yourself the way God made you or whatever
0:58:56.800000 - 0:59:04.200000::Creatures it's upon this planet long over yourself take care of yourself do your thing and you will find somebody
0:59:09.320000 - 0:59:11.320000::Cool
0:59:11.720000 - 0:59:13.720000::Oh
