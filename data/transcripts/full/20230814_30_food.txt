0:00:10.880000 - 0:00:12.760000::let's not talk about fucking ketchup, mustard, dude.
0:00:12.760000 - 0:00:14.680000::Well, I want to, man.
0:00:14.680000 - 0:00:15.760000::I don't know that much.
0:00:15.760000 - 0:00:17.880000::And this is what I know some shit about, OK.

0:00:39.480000 - 0:00:40.800000::It's my name's Eric Rahill, and I'm
0:00:40.800000 - 0:00:43.120000::starting off the podcast about a leader
0:00:43.120000 - 0:00:46.720000::in to a Poland spring, leader in a half bottle of water
0:00:46.720000 - 0:00:49.040000::that I got at a gas station today.
0:00:49.040000 - 0:00:51.800000::And I got to say, these are a treat.
0:00:51.800000 - 0:00:53.040000::The smart water's cost.
0:00:53.040000 - 0:00:54.920000::No, Jack, you have one, too.
0:00:54.920000 - 0:00:55.520000::I have one.
0:00:55.520000 - 0:00:56.480000::You have a baby size.
0:00:56.480000 - 0:00:57.520000::I have a baby size.
0:00:57.520000 - 0:01:01.520000::This is all the water I've drank in today, stranded on an island
0:01:01.520000 - 0:01:02.240000::style.
0:01:02.240000 - 0:01:03.840000::And I got this one at the airport, Eric.
0:01:03.840000 - 0:01:06.480000::So there's automobiles and planes.
0:01:06.480000 - 0:01:07.240000::And planes.
0:01:07.240000 - 0:01:08.840000::Did you go on a train day today?
0:01:08.840000 - 0:01:10.600000::I actually care about the environment.
0:01:10.600000 - 0:01:12.800000::I'm using a hydroflask right now.
0:01:12.800000 - 0:01:20.520000::And I've saved a lot of plastic bubbles.
0:01:20.520000 - 0:01:24.200000::So you must not know about the hydroflask fucking minds.
0:01:26.960000 - 0:01:27.320000::Yep.
0:01:27.320000 - 0:01:29.120000::They fucking have to mind the fucking dirt,
0:01:29.120000 - 0:01:31.680000::all that metal that you think is so easy to get.
0:01:31.680000 - 0:01:33.720000::Well guess what, there's family's fucking mining
0:01:33.720000 - 0:01:34.560000::for the hydroflask.
0:01:34.560000 - 0:01:36.360000::That's probably 100% true.
0:01:36.360000 - 0:01:37.560000::Yeah, it is.
0:01:37.560000 - 0:01:40.560000::And they're fucking clanging on like old blacksmiths.
0:01:40.560000 - 0:01:41.600000::They can hide their flasks.
0:01:41.600000 - 0:01:44.640000::Oh, I gotta do a fucking purple one right now.
0:01:44.640000 - 0:01:46.360000::Putting the NPR stickers on them.
0:01:46.360000 - 0:01:48.480000::You don't know what pain you're causing across the world
0:01:48.480000 - 0:01:52.120000::by trying to be all liberal.
0:01:52.120000 - 0:01:53.360000::Fuck pain.
0:01:53.360000 - 0:01:54.320000::Fuck pain.
0:01:54.320000 - 0:01:55.840000::Oh, fuck pain.
0:01:55.840000 - 0:01:57.960000::We wanted to talk about something that is essentially
0:01:57.960000 - 0:02:00.520000::the opposite of pain unless it's the bad version of it.
0:02:00.520000 - 0:02:01.360000::Yeah.
0:02:01.360000 - 0:02:03.960000::But the topic is food.
0:02:03.960000 - 0:02:04.800000::Food.
0:02:04.800000 - 0:02:05.800000::Delicious foods.
0:02:05.800000 - 0:02:08.120000::Can you say food or can you say?
0:02:08.120000 - 0:02:08.960000::Can you spell food?
0:02:08.960000 - 0:02:10.040000::Get it, get my belly.
0:02:11.800000 - 0:02:15.480000::Hey, I can't believe we haven't talked about this previously
0:02:15.480000 - 0:02:19.480000::because like, this is probably the one thing in the world
0:02:19.480000 - 0:02:21.560000::that gives people the most joy of anything else
0:02:21.560000 - 0:02:25.800000::is the meals that you have and the meals that you share them with.
0:02:26.840000 - 0:02:29.080000::So I think we should organize this.
0:02:29.080000 - 0:02:31.800000::I'm finally bringing my organizational skills
0:02:31.800000 - 0:02:36.320000::and kind of workflow strength to this podcast.
0:02:36.320000 - 0:02:37.640000::And I think we should break it up.
0:02:37.640000 - 0:02:40.520000::I think we should talk about food that we like to cook,
0:02:40.520000 - 0:02:42.360000::snacks that we like to eat from this door,
0:02:42.360000 - 0:02:43.880000::and then go into restaurants at the end,
0:02:43.880000 - 0:02:45.040000::which is the treat.
0:02:45.040000 - 0:02:46.800000::This is what people really want to know.
0:02:46.800000 - 0:02:48.200000::They want to know our restaurant knowledge
0:02:48.200000 - 0:02:49.400000::for the big cities.
0:02:49.400000 - 0:02:50.400000::That's great.
0:02:50.400000 - 0:02:52.800000::So thank you for bringing your organizational skills.
0:02:52.800000 - 0:02:53.720000::Yeah, finally.
0:02:53.760000 - 0:02:56.160000::That's why we brought you on to the podcast initially
0:02:56.160000 - 0:02:59::and now that you're laid off, it's perfect.
0:02:59 - 0:03:01.080000::I have been looking at my fucking resume
0:03:01.080000 - 0:03:02.760000::and it's saying shit like,
0:03:02.760000 - 0:03:06.160000::pro collab, just I can't even go into it.
0:03:06.160000 - 0:03:07.640000::The bear season two.
0:03:07.640000 - 0:03:08.920000::Yeah, bear season two.
0:03:09.920000 - 0:03:10.920000::Yeah.
0:03:13.040000 - 0:03:17.480000::It just says FX, like FX March through March 2023,
0:03:17.480000 - 0:03:18.800000::through March 2023.
0:03:19.200000 - 0:03:23.200000::But no, seriously food.
0:03:25.200000 - 0:03:26.760000::We'll go into the history for a second.
0:03:26.760000 - 0:03:29.640000::Long ago we were foraging for this stuff,
0:03:29.640000 - 0:03:32.840000::country gathers, before we knew how to farm, right?
0:03:32.840000 - 0:03:35.480000::So it was berries and rabbits and venison
0:03:35.480000 - 0:03:37.880000::and that's how we're supposed to eat,
0:03:37.880000 - 0:03:42.280000::but it's not as delicious as the farmed shit, right?
0:03:42.280000 - 0:03:43.480000::You guys know this.
0:03:43.480000 - 0:03:44.400000::Of course.
0:03:44.400000 - 0:03:46.320000::Well, the thing is foraging.
0:03:46.320000 - 0:03:48.720000::It's funny to remove ourselves from nature
0:03:48.720000 - 0:03:53.720000::because foraging is simply organic shopping, right?
0:03:54.440000 - 0:03:56.560000::So if you go to the grocery store,
0:03:56.560000 - 0:04:01.160000::you are foraging, you're just foraging in metal.
0:04:01.160000 - 0:04:03.400000::Just instead of picking something out of the dirt,
0:04:03.400000 - 0:04:05.040000::it's a piece of metal.
0:04:05.040000 - 0:04:07.920000::So I encourage you to not remove yourself
0:04:07.920000 - 0:04:09.320000::from nature so much like that.
0:04:09.320000 - 0:04:11.120000::We're animals.
0:04:11.120000 - 0:04:14.160000::You shouldn't be ashamed if you fucking get into fights
0:04:14.160000 - 0:04:16.880000::at the airport or on a bike path.
0:04:16.880000 - 0:04:18.920000::It's just a natural animalistic instinct
0:04:18.920000 - 0:04:21.560000::to tear somebody's just reds.
0:04:21.560000 - 0:04:22.400000::It is.
0:04:22.400000 - 0:04:24.120000::But when it comes to cooking, huh?
0:04:24.120000 - 0:04:25.560000::Oh, I was just gonna say this,
0:04:25.560000 - 0:04:27.320000::but eating that way by the way,
0:04:27.320000 - 0:04:30.520000::just the motion of that type of eating that food
0:04:30.520000 - 0:04:32.320000::gives us amazing facial structures
0:04:32.320000 - 0:04:35.240000::that are sorely missing from our society,
0:04:35.240000 - 0:04:37.360000::the West and the societies today.
0:04:37.360000 - 0:04:40.320000::We used to chew on gristle and on bones.
0:04:40.320000 - 0:04:41.600000::I don't know why I heard this.
0:04:41.600000 - 0:04:42.880000::It might have been Hebrew men.
0:04:43.880000 - 0:04:47.280000::But we're eating too much soft processed stuff these days.
0:04:47.280000 - 0:04:49.480000::And our faces look like shit
0:04:49.480000 - 0:04:51.480000::because there's no muscles working in our jaws.
0:04:51.480000 - 0:04:52.320000::Sorry, I'm getting pissed.
0:04:52.320000 - 0:04:55.800000::No, no, sorry to cut you off, but it's called
0:04:55.800000 - 0:04:59.600000::and they're calling us the gogert generation.
0:04:59.600000 - 0:05:00.440000::No.

0:05:00 - 0:05:06.360000::Google it because and Nate you're an expert on this because you're the one of the big victims of it kids ate so much gog
0:05:06.360000 - 0:05:11.600000::Gurgers that their face got all shaped all crazy like that horse filter out and tick tock the next movie. Oh
0:05:14.400000 - 0:05:16.400000::Used to freeze them gogerts
0:05:17.200000 - 0:05:21.040000::Oh, yeah, goger and the freezer suck on it like a lollipop. Yeah
0:05:22.160000 - 0:05:24.600000::That's cooking Nate. I feel like I've been
0:05:25.600000 - 0:05:33.600000::freezing things more that don't need to be frozen, you know as I'm aging like I put a scone in the freezer
0:05:33.960000 - 0:05:36.480000::Why and just ate it all frozen
0:05:40.600000 - 0:05:43.520000::I read that it makes me think about this story
0:05:43.520000 - 0:05:47.680000::I just read about the first the youngest person to ever get Alzheimer's was just found in China
0:05:49.840000 - 0:05:51.840000::You might be in a
0:05:54.600000 - 0:05:56.600000::Frozen scones
0:05:56.600000 - 0:06:02.720000::Well, man, you know, you know the most psychotic thing I've ever seen frozen was when we were in Martha's Vineyard and Jack
0:06:02.720000 - 0:06:06.520000::I bought some twizzlers for us watching a movie and Jack put them in the freezer
0:06:06.800000 - 0:06:08.800000::What's that?
0:06:12.320000 - 0:06:19.280000::First of all that's not even the most psychotic thing that I put in the freezer on that trip. What else did you put in there?
0:06:19.280000 - 0:06:20.280000::I
0:06:20.320000 - 0:06:24.080000::Here's what I did I got a bunch of fruit
0:06:24.960000 - 0:06:29.720000::Roll ups and I put one scoop of vanilla ice cream on top of each of them
0:06:30.160000 - 0:06:36.240000::Like a plate of hors d'oeuvres and I put the plate back in the freezer and what shocked me and then I was gonna
0:06:36.240000 - 0:06:41.960000::Go give one to everybody and what shocked me is that somehow in the freezer all the fucking ice cream melted on that fucking plate
0:06:42.200000 - 0:06:45.680000::So then when I brought everything back out I was basically just
0:06:46 - 0:06:50.440000::Getting fucking laughed at because I came out with this plate of hors d'oeuvres all sweating down my fucking face
0:06:50.440000 - 0:06:54.840000::I feel like everyone my memory of that is like everyone just ignored you like they're just like
0:06:55.560000 - 0:07:02.680000::You just came out with this like the craziest plate of snacks anyone's ever seen their I came out with a plate of basically eight
0:07:03.800000 - 0:07:09::Scoops of ice cream melted onto I basically came out with a plate of melted ice cream everybody
0:07:09.640000 - 0:07:13.280000::Didn't take me seriously. It's a good instinct. Listen. It's a good instinct
0:07:13.280000 - 0:07:16.240000::What my ice cream order on that trip was
0:07:17.240000 - 0:07:18.920000::Mint chocolate chip
0:07:18.920000 - 0:07:26.480000::With gummy bears and hot fudge, okay, and I think there's something about those gummies being all a little bit frozen by the ice cream
0:07:26.480000 - 0:07:29.400000::And that sounds like a similar thing to the fruit roll up being
0:07:31.120000 - 0:07:35.440000::Thanks man for some reason hearing my voice right now. It's making me feel disassociated
0:07:36.520000 - 0:07:42.200000::Talking about this for the first time in a while. I get oh feeling like I'm watching myself doing this from about 10 feet above my head
0:07:42.680000 - 0:07:47.640000::So that could be a coming stroke. It could be something bad, but I'm gonna fucking hold tight and rock
0:07:48.240000 - 0:07:54.200000::This podcast fucking out. Yeah, nope. No, and yes, what if you want to have a panic attack crazy?
0:07:54.200000 - 0:08:04.240000::I don't get those I don't get those man. That's not me. You got me mistaken. Of course. Why if somebody else wants to have panic attack on his podcast name
0:08:05.240000 - 0:08:07.240000::Schmere
0:08:07.240000 - 0:08:10::That's a different one all I'm saying is man
0:08:10.800000 - 0:08:12.800000::That's gonna be a good clip. Oh
0:08:14.440000 - 0:08:16.960000::You guys aren't thinking about the clips man. Oh
0:08:18.240000 - 0:08:21.360000::I'm always thinking about clips. I didn't have the
0:08:22.400000 - 0:08:26.600000::Technical know how to create these in my head. I'm in a clip right now. Look at me
0:08:26.600000 - 0:08:32.560000::I'm probably on Instagram right now on a clip on a TikTok who knows what's gonna happen the clips are so good
0:08:32.800000 - 0:08:36.640000::We should be pretty planning the clips like I at fucking 12 minutes. I'm gonna
0:08:36.640000 - 0:08:39.680000::That's a good idea. It's tell stories about great ideas. Oh wow
0:08:40 - 0:08:43.080000::If we had a hour long podcast that was just all clips
0:08:43.880000 - 0:08:48.320000::One minute 61 minute clips that we all had written before that's all people care about
0:08:48.880000 - 0:08:50.880000::Yeah, they just want the fucking clips
0:08:50.880000 - 0:08:52.880000::Wow, don't you don't you?
0:08:54.400000 - 0:08:58.920000::You all just like us for our clips. You don't even like us for what we are man
0:08:58.920000 - 0:09:04.040000::Don't even give a fuck about any of us or this podcast all you want is a fucking clip. Don't you
0:09:07.480000 - 0:09:12.160000::Honestly, we probably have the opposite of that in reality because our clips get no fucking love in their trash
0:09:12.160000 - 0:09:13.920000::I put it to where it's clip on the

0:11:41.040000 - 0:11:44.080000::And he's throwing that shit at me and then it was kind of like
0:11:44.760000 - 0:11:48.920000::From Zoolander when they're all riding around that truck spraying each other with gasoline. That was the vibes
0:11:49.920000 - 0:11:51.920000::We were just so joyful we

0:12:15.960000 - 0:12:20.040000::You know what I wait so now Nate is that pretty much what your perspective was to
0:12:20.840000 - 0:12:22.840000::That was that was exactly my perspective
0:12:22.840000 - 0:12:24.840000::I remember being shocked because I was looking
0:12:25.320000 - 0:12:31.800000::Over at Eric and we were playing like frisbee and then I just looked over to the right and like you were just
0:12:32.360000 - 0:12:36.560000::All of your clothes were off like it was just like out of nowhere and I was like oh shit
0:12:36.560000 - 0:12:41.800000::Yeah, and so I guess we're doing this so I've seen you guys naked before in the sun as of course
0:12:42.040000 - 0:12:45.040000::Yeah, many times we've been the new song
0:12:45.040000 - 0:12:50.520000::Many times we've got of course you think you could function in a nudist colony like if you were
0:12:57.880000 - 0:13:01.920000::Like that you know people try to play off nudist colonies as this non-sexual
0:13:01.920000 - 0:13:07.240000::It's to no those people are fucking freaks. Okay, they are they are trying to get their rocks
0:13:07.480000 - 0:13:15.280000::Maybe not all of them, but a lot of them are fucking weirdos. Okay, let's just say it wild country whatever it's called wild wild country
0:13:15.520000 - 0:13:17.520000::That was a nudist colony with clothes
0:13:18.560000 - 0:13:20.560000::Can I share my perspective on
0:13:21.240000 - 0:13:23::The frisbee thing. Oh, yes
0:13:23 - 0:13:26.560000::Yes, and then I need to return to what why even brought up these suns in the first place
0:13:26.560000 - 0:13:30.800000::Okay, and then I need to return to something good little bit before all this okay
0:13:31.160000 - 0:13:36.080000::Okay, we will do that. Okay, we're perfect. Okay, so here's my perspective. We're on the nude beach
0:13:36.080000 - 0:13:39.800000::I'm with the 3L joy tactics air gray on the
0:13:42.800000 - 0:13:44.800000::Delas much
0:13:44.800000 - 0:13:50.080000::so then we're oh there's kind of this one the nude beach this night
0:13:50.080000 - 0:13:54.960000::We're playing frisbee the three of us and I think oh this is funny. I'm gonna throw the frisbee
0:13:55.800000 - 0:13:59.720000::Way past Nate on purpose so that he turns around and
0:14:00.440000 - 0:14:09.560000::Then that's gonna be my opportunity to completely get naked when he's looking and then and before before I threw the frisbee over there
0:14:09.560000 - 0:14:12.640000::I looked at Eric and I did this and
0:14:15.080000 - 0:14:18.960000::You looked at me, but you I guess didn't understand what was about to happen
0:14:18.960000 - 0:14:23.240000::So I throw the frisbee past Nate Nate turns around. He goes runs up the hill to get it
0:14:23.240000 - 0:14:29.200000::I take all my clothes off and Eric is just kind of looking at me and then he doesn't join in
0:14:29.720000 - 0:14:32.800000::I'm like what the fuck and then Nate and then Nate turns around with the frisbee
0:14:33.080000 - 0:14:37.360000::Nate doesn't look at me and throws the frisbee to Eric and doesn't notice it
0:14:41.280000 - 0:14:46.800000::No, not even a little bit and then I'm out there for like 45 seconds at this point in the nude no one's
0:14:48 - 0:14:52.440000::And then Eric throws the frisbee to me and I see Nate track as the frisbee's coming over to me
0:14:52.440000 - 0:14:54.440000::He his eyes are following the frisbee
0:14:54.440000 - 0:14:59.800000::It finally lands on me and he basically his jaw got to the floor because I got that 16 inches

0:15:00 - 0:15:02.180000::Flas it all. Oh, I saw that thing.
0:15:02.180000 - 0:15:04.800000::Grabbed on it. I had all sorts of.
0:15:04.800000 - 0:15:06.960000::We're one of the most well-endowed pot.
0:15:06.960000 - 0:15:09.220000::If we had, if we could bolt on our penises
0:15:09.220000 - 0:15:12.200000::in one single, the sub reveal locked out,
0:15:12.200000 - 0:15:15.720000::it would, it's fun with me fucking blocked out.
0:15:15.720000 - 0:15:19.560000::The clips and the ground, even gonna lie NGL.
0:15:19.560000 - 0:15:21.960000::NGL, we got to like that.
0:15:21.960000 - 0:15:23.880000::Yep, everything. Yep.
0:15:23.880000 - 0:15:25.640000::So, no, but I'm not.
0:15:25.640000 - 0:15:26.880000::That was amazing.
0:15:27 - 0:15:32::But anyways, below this spot and bottom bottom, Germany,
0:15:32 - 0:15:36.360000::it was, this was built on an ancient Roman spring,
0:15:36.360000 - 0:15:40.080000::which I'm sure the Romans built it upon indigenous Germans.
0:15:40.080000 - 0:15:43.560000::You know, you're all taking everybody else's hot springs.
0:15:43.560000 - 0:15:47.760000::But below, you could go into the ruins of the Roman sauna.
0:15:47.760000 - 0:15:48.760000::And they had it built up.
0:15:48.760000 - 0:15:50.760000::So you put on these headphones and you're,
0:15:50.760000 - 0:15:53.440000::it's like a radio play ASMR where it's like,
0:15:53.440000 - 0:15:54.760000::you're hearing the water trickle down
0:15:54.800000 - 0:15:57.040000::and they're talking and fucking, we're Latin.
0:15:57.040000 - 0:15:58.200000::And they're translating it.
0:15:58.200000 - 0:16:00.800000::And they, you go to the snack room.
0:16:00.800000 - 0:16:02.400000::They had like a room where you can see they,
0:16:02.400000 - 0:16:04.520000::they had big pots where they were eating snacks
0:16:04.520000 - 0:16:06.040000::before they were going into the sanas.
0:16:06.040000 - 0:16:06.880000::Oh my God.
0:16:06.880000 - 0:16:08.480000::Come on, what the, we're doing that in L.A.
0:16:08.480000 - 0:16:11.600000::And check the fucking crevice sanas.
0:16:11.600000 - 0:16:12.440000::You know what I mean?
0:16:12.440000 - 0:16:13.600000::How different are we from them?
0:16:13.600000 - 0:16:14.920000::We're not, okay?
0:16:14.920000 - 0:16:16.800000::From German people?
0:16:16.800000 - 0:16:18.640000::From the Roman, the ancient Romans.
0:16:18.640000 - 0:16:21.200000::Okay. Or from any German, you know.
0:16:21.200000 - 0:16:22.040000::I see what you're saying.
0:16:22.040000 - 0:16:23.400000::We're kind of, we kind of been the same.
0:16:23.400000 - 0:16:27.240000::No, of course, all these, this is what I was saying
0:16:27.240000 - 0:16:30.560000::on last episode actually with the Zoom speech
0:16:30.560000 - 0:16:33.480000::is we keep making these technological advances
0:16:33.480000 - 0:16:35.520000::and this and that, but all we're doing is,
0:16:36.440000 - 0:16:40.440000::you know, putting gilded armament onto the things
0:16:40.440000 - 0:16:42.040000::that we always knew gave us pleasure
0:16:42.040000 - 0:16:46.040000::and always will in perpetuity, which is human connection,
0:16:46.040000 - 0:16:47.520000::which is the government, which is, which is,
0:16:47.520000 - 0:16:49::which is the armament.
0:16:49 - 0:16:51.240000::I don't, I took such a huge swing with that,
0:16:51.240000 - 0:16:52.320000::whether that was correct.
0:16:52.320000 - 0:16:54.720000::Literally, it's making me think like that is a great way
0:16:54.720000 - 0:16:56.040000::to put it.
0:16:56.040000 - 0:16:59.760000::No, that's fucking, I'm so glad because, huh?
0:16:59.760000 - 0:17:01.080000::I was saying, if you're tuning in right now,
0:17:01.080000 - 0:17:03.360000::this is the gilded armament episode.
0:17:03.360000 - 0:17:05.840000::We're gonna, yeah, just everything.
0:17:05.840000 - 0:17:09.320000::Digging food, we're going into, like, gilded armaments.
0:17:09.320000 - 0:17:12.400000::I said a word so incorrect yesterday.
0:17:12.400000 - 0:17:13.720000::What did you say?
0:17:14.800000 - 0:17:16.680000::I said it was, it was one of them times
0:17:16.680000 - 0:17:18.520000::when it was humiliating.
0:17:18.520000 - 0:17:21.360000::I said, I think I meant to say like this,
0:17:21.360000 - 0:17:25.760000::this conversation is like decomposing.
0:17:25.760000 - 0:17:26.800000::What's like another word for that?
0:17:26.800000 - 0:17:28.200000::Yeah, yeah.
0:17:28.200000 - 0:17:29.680000::Decade like disintegrating.
0:17:29.680000 - 0:17:30.320000::Decade like disintegrating.
0:17:30.320000 - 0:17:31.480000::Maybe.
0:17:31.480000 - 0:17:33.040000::I think I said divulging.
0:17:35.200000 - 0:17:38.280000::I said, I had a similar instance where I said
0:17:38.280000 - 0:17:41.440000::the word postulate and I'm not even certain how,
0:17:41.440000 - 0:17:42.840000::I'm not even certain.
0:17:42.840000 - 0:17:43.680000::That means like to think.
0:17:43.680000 - 0:17:45.600000::Like what that word even means, but it felt right
0:17:45.600000 - 0:17:46.440000::when I said it.
0:17:46.440000 - 0:17:48::I think I nailed it.
0:17:48 - 0:17:50.200000::I really do think I nailed what that word is,
0:17:50.200000 - 0:17:53.880000::but I was like, I don't really know what this word means,
0:17:53.880000 - 0:17:56.960000::but I'm gonna go for it and just say it.
0:17:56.960000 - 0:17:57.800000::Is it like to have a fight?
0:17:57.800000 - 0:18:00.720000::I'm gonna take a big swing and then learn.
0:18:00.720000 - 0:18:01.560000::You know what I mean?
0:18:01.560000 - 0:18:03.880000::And then yeah, or change the definition.
0:18:03.880000 - 0:18:04.960000::If you have enough influence.
0:18:04.960000 - 0:18:06.080000::Afraid to fail.
0:18:06.080000 - 0:18:09.840000::A swing back is a wind up for a swing at.
0:18:09.840000 - 0:18:10.680000::Swing out.
0:18:10.680000 - 0:18:14.160000::What it's called when it goes over the back of it?
0:18:14.160000 - 0:18:15::That's a home run.
0:18:15 - 0:18:15.840000::A home run.
0:18:17.120000 - 0:18:18.120000::What's it called?
0:18:18.120000 - 0:18:19.760000::Home play over the back of it.
0:18:20.040000 - 0:18:22.800000::Okay, and you know what, we gotta just keep making food right.
0:18:22.800000 - 0:18:23.400000::Think about this.
0:18:23.400000 - 0:18:25.160000::Grand Slam, Danny's.
0:18:25.160000 - 0:18:26.680000::Oh, shit.

0:24:51.200000 - 0:24:57.760000::I dare you I fucking dare you if you're listening right now to try to even guess what subject matter
0:24:57.760000 - 0:25:00.040000::I'm about to bring up this is about to be the most

0:25:00 - 0:25:04.400000::left field is shit. Alright here we go take a second to guess now here's my idea.
0:25:04.400000 - 0:25:14.640000::It's a marathon, air expiring cologne all the first. Why'd you just do that?
0:25:14.640000 - 0:25:17.560000::What'd you do? I thought it'd be funny right at the beginning of the way you're saying
0:25:17.560000 - 0:25:21.600000::to be speaking spritz in it. Well it was. Okay sorry.
0:25:21.600000 - 0:25:32.280000::Alright okay what are you? What are you gonna say? It's a marathon. It's called a 5K
0:25:32.280000 - 0:25:36.880000::whatever it's a race but there's and let's say there's like a hundred people
0:25:36.880000 - 0:25:41.640000::they're all entering it but it's indoors and it's non-directional and it's
0:25:41.640000 - 0:25:45.880000::whoever can just get to 5K you have to like through the distance jet but
0:25:45.880000 - 0:25:49.240000::the only distance you have is a limited space so everyone's like darting all
0:25:49.240000 - 0:25:53.840000::around inside of one area enclosed trying not to fucking bump into each other
0:25:53.840000 - 0:25:59.560000::trying to get fucking distance in. I guess that would be like an agility
0:25:59.560000 - 0:26:04.840000::marathon essentially a crowded agility marathon. And they're running like a 5k but
0:26:04.840000 - 0:26:10.120000::just it's a 5k so it's like in steps it's being measured or something you
0:26:10.120000 - 0:26:14.840000::know what I'm saying but it's that seems like that would be beautiful to watch
0:26:14.840000 - 0:26:19.160000::on like a time lapse you know. Oh wow. It would be like synchronized
0:26:19.160000 - 0:26:22.600000::swimming type of thing like a chaotic version of seeing my swimming you know.
0:26:22.600000 - 0:26:28.120000::Yeah. Can't remember why. So Jack what the hell why did you say this? I'm
0:26:28.120000 - 0:26:33.200000::trying. So that's not right. Hey man it's the zombie great
0:26:33.200000 - 0:26:40.720000::portion. I tell you I tell you this is one of those moments where it's gone
0:26:40.720000 - 0:26:47.720000::like there was something that somebody said that there was a link but I couldn't
0:26:47.720000 - 0:26:51.640000::go into my head. I can't guess what I'm gonna keep us back on track right now
0:26:51.640000 - 0:26:54.360000::in the biggest way ever. With this question. Oh,
0:26:54.360000 - 0:26:59::shit. We go. We're gonna we're gonna ride back on track here. Go now. Say it.
0:26:59 - 0:27:04.320000::You are on death's death row for a crime that you deserve to be on fucking death
0:27:04.320000 - 0:27:07.720000::row for defending our family members honor probably and I won't go into
0:27:07.720000 - 0:27:13.800000::the detail but I would go crazy. Don't worry about it. Yeah. And right
0:27:13.800000 - 0:27:17.720000::before you're about to get the firing squad they kind of brought this
0:27:17.720000 - 0:27:25.080000::type of death that's penalty back just for you. They ask you what's your last
0:27:25.080000 - 0:27:30.520000::meal gonna be and you can get anything you want and you can get any amount
0:27:30.520000 - 0:27:36.280000::that you want and you can't say I want like to eat like a key or something
0:27:36.280000 - 0:27:40.040000::like that. You know, don't. I was like, I know I was gonna say let's listen
0:27:40.040000 - 0:27:43.040000::ground rules down. Let's not be silly. Like everybody's gonna try to be funny.
0:27:43.040000 - 0:27:47.280000::Be real because I want to know you this part about you guys for real in case
0:27:47.280000 - 0:27:50.320000::everybody have to fucking come. And by the way, I was made fun of for my
0:27:50.320000 - 0:27:54.120000::answer when I answer this in a group setting. So I want to see if you guys
0:27:54.120000 - 0:27:59.040000::will kind of shame me for what my true answer is. Okay. You know what I would
0:27:59.040000 - 0:28:05.800000::fucking say. Frankly, there is a there is a burrito that I've eaten probably
0:28:05.800000 - 0:28:09.440000::a hundred times since I've been living in New York. Okay. Literally not a joke.
0:28:09.440000 - 0:28:15.240000::And Jack introduced me to it and then he said this. No, no, I think so. And it's
0:28:15.240000 - 0:28:20.240000::just it's so comforting to me. This is my comfort fucking meal. It's not the
0:28:20.240000 - 0:28:24.240000::best thing I've ever eaten. It's not like my top. But it is come pure comfort.
0:28:24.240000 - 0:28:30.640000::It is the chicken tinge burrito with the chips and guac with the pickled onions
0:28:30.640000 - 0:28:35.040000::and with as many sauces as I so choose to probably 10 sauces because I go
0:28:35.040000 - 0:28:41::fucking through those things from Dalia in Bushwick. Okay. And the way I eat it, I
0:28:41 - 0:28:44.200000::take a fucking bite. I put a little pickled onion on there, the purple pickled
0:28:44.200000 - 0:28:49.280000::onion, tongue twister. And then I put a little green salsa bite to start
0:28:49.280000 - 0:28:52.080000::track. Turn that shit on when I'm feeling fucking. And how long are you gonna take to
0:28:52.080000 - 0:28:55.440000::eat this meal while I'm on the firing squad as the guns pointed at you.
0:28:55.440000 - 0:28:59.080000::Based on my track record and I'm not trying to you know what I mean six minutes.

0:32:53.880000 - 0:32:55.680000::You're a share waste or in a share stealer.
0:32:55.680000 - 0:32:58.080000::And that's final.

0:33:40.280000 - 0:33:41.680000::Don't even give a fuck.
0:33:41.680000 - 0:33:45.320000::Just talking about ice like this is making me want to walk the Taco Bell right after this.
0:33:45.320000 - 0:33:47.080000::But don't eat it on the airplane.
0:33:47.080000 - 0:33:48.080000::No, no.
0:33:48.080000 - 0:33:49.080000::What the hell?
0:33:49.080000 - 0:33:50.080000::Why cause they make ice?
0:33:50.080000 - 0:33:51.080000::That ice.
0:33:51.080000 - 0:33:52.080000::Oh, I heard about it.
0:33:52.080000 - 0:33:53.080000::Wait, why?
0:33:53.080000 - 0:33:57.080000::And don't drink the, you're gonna water on there and listen from a bottle.
0:33:57.080000 - 0:33:58.080000::Or the coffee.
0:33:58.080000 - 0:34:00.080000::Or do not drink the fucking coffee.
0:34:00.080000 - 0:34:01.080000::What's happening?
0:34:01.080000 - 0:34:08.320000::There is bacteria in that ice that is so horribly toxic and I see people was fucking clunking
0:34:08.320000 - 0:34:10.320000::on it chewing on it.
0:34:10.320000 - 0:34:14.440000::You're eating bacteria that you could probably see with a fucking naked eye.
0:34:14.440000 - 0:34:15.440000::Okay?
0:34:15.440000 - 0:34:16.440000::Because they're not cleaning those pipes.
0:34:16.440000 - 0:34:19.240000::They're not cleaning those ice machines on the fucking planes.
0:34:19.240000 - 0:34:20.240000::Okay?
0:34:20.240000 - 0:34:23.960000::You aren't some ancient 1988 fucking spirit or something.
0:34:23.960000 - 0:34:26.760000::That's why I bring my own ice on planes.
0:34:26.760000 - 0:34:27.760000::Yeah, yeah.
0:34:27.760000 - 0:34:30.760000::And you rush into, excuse me, like, sorry, you're like at the beginning of security.
0:34:30.760000 - 0:34:32.760000::Oh, dude, I'll make ice on that one.
0:34:32.760000 - 0:34:33.760000::Can I please?
0:34:33.760000 - 0:34:35.560000::Your ice down.
0:34:35.560000 - 0:34:39.760000::I'll put water in my mouth and just like through my power, turn it into ice.
0:34:39.760000 - 0:34:42.520000::Oh, oh my god.
0:34:42.520000 - 0:34:43.520000::Yeah.
0:34:43.520000 - 0:34:44.520000::So, Jack.
0:34:44.520000 - 0:34:47.840000::A question.
0:34:47.840000 - 0:34:51.360000::What would you be eating for your last meal?
0:34:51.360000 - 0:34:52.360000::Honestly.
0:34:52.360000 - 0:34:54.360000::And be honest.
0:34:54.360000 - 0:34:56.880000::And be fucking honest.
0:34:56.880000 - 0:34:59.440000::It's really what's funny about a last meal is like.

0:35:00 - 0:35:05::You're not always in the mood for the same food.
0:35:05.220000 - 0:35:06.220000::Yeah, I know.
0:35:06.220000 - 0:35:07.900000::But I guess,
0:35:09.140000 - 0:35:11.780000::do you think you would have to like decide in the moment?
0:35:11.780000 - 0:35:15.140000::I think I would have so much raw emotion
0:35:15.140000 - 0:35:17.640000::and like it wouldn't be a food that's like,
0:35:17.640000 - 0:35:19.360000::man, this is the most delicious thing
0:35:19.360000 - 0:35:21.300000::that I had in my life or this.
0:35:21.300000 - 0:35:23.100000::It would be something that I feel like I need
0:35:23.100000 - 0:35:25.060000::in a moment of death.
0:35:25.060000 - 0:35:26.540000::Poke bowl.
0:35:26.540000 - 0:35:27.380000::Nope.
0:35:27.380000 - 0:35:28.380000::Okay.
0:35:28.380000 - 0:35:29.700000::Don't joke.
0:35:29.820000 - 0:35:31.900000::I don't know, I'll tell you what it is right now.
0:35:31.900000 - 0:35:32.900000::What is it?
0:35:33.940000 - 0:35:38.940000::I want one long vanilla Charleston chew.
0:35:41.380000 - 0:35:44.180000::And I'm gonna sit there and look at those boys
0:35:44.180000 - 0:35:45.820000::with the girls and whatever,
0:35:45.820000 - 0:35:47.700000::what their guns point at me.
0:35:47.700000 - 0:35:49.980000::And I'm gonna just unwrap it like a banana
0:35:49.980000 - 0:35:53.180000::and just one bite, eat like a cow
0:35:53.180000 - 0:35:55.100000::and then let them shoot me dead like a cow.
0:35:56.660000 - 0:35:57.500000::Wow.
0:35:57.500000 - 0:35:59.460000::And those are good frozen by the way.
0:35:59.500000 - 0:36:01.660000::That's a good fucking frozen candy.
0:36:01.660000 - 0:36:02.500000::Throw that.
0:36:02.500000 - 0:36:03.700000::I really don't freeze anything.
0:36:03.700000 - 0:36:05.580000::I've had a bag of bagels that my friend gave me
0:36:05.580000 - 0:36:08.900000::in the freezer for probably six months at this point.
0:36:10.620000 - 0:36:11.860000::Let's eat those bagels, man.
0:36:11.860000 - 0:36:13.860000::You want to be, you never invite me over, man.
0:36:13.860000 - 0:36:16.100000::All right, come over, bring a two liter of Sprite,
0:36:16.100000 - 0:36:18.460000::each and let's fuck Grecia these things tonight.
0:36:18.460000 - 0:36:20.260000::I love bagels and Sprite.
0:36:20.260000 - 0:36:21.500000::Dude, if you get a Sprite,
0:36:21.500000 - 0:36:24.300000::if we thought these fucking cinnamon raisin bagels
0:36:24.300000 - 0:36:26.460000::and just fucking put them in our mouths
0:36:26.460000 - 0:36:28.460000::and then soften them with the Sprite
0:36:28.460000 - 0:36:29.700000::and then fuck them mush them down,
0:36:29.700000 - 0:36:32.100000::we could probably get it crushed that hour.
0:36:32.100000 - 0:36:33.900000::Can I ask you guys something?
0:36:33.900000 - 0:36:35.060000::Anytime.
0:36:35.060000 - 0:36:36.380000::You literally always could.
0:36:36.380000 - 0:36:37.220000::I'm open-catchable.
0:36:37.220000 - 0:36:40.140000::What is freezer burn and is it bad for you?
0:36:40.140000 - 0:36:41.940000::Freezer burn, dude.
0:36:41.940000 - 0:36:44.380000::This is when more, literally it's this simple.
0:36:46.100000 - 0:36:49.780000::It's when something's been left in the freezer for too long
0:36:49.780000 - 0:36:52.620000::and the moisture seeps out and,
0:36:55.180000 - 0:36:56.900000::because I'm asking because I,
0:36:56.900000 - 0:36:59.540000::I ate something that has probably been in the freezer
0:36:59.540000 - 0:37:01.900000::for maybe two to three years
0:37:01.900000 - 0:37:03.300000::and I was like,
0:37:03.300000 - 0:37:06.980000::and it was the most hellishly freezer burned thing

0:50:51.240000 - 0:50:51.680000::Okay.
0:50:52.080000 - 0:50:56::And by the time the future, there's all sorts of aliens, you know, so it's not just
0:50:56 - 0:50:57::human food they need to make.
0:50:57 - 0:50:58.440000::They need to make the cling on food.
0:50:58.800000 - 0:51:04::They need to make the fucking Vulcan food, the all the rest of for angry food.
0:51:04 - 0:51:08.160000::And they go up to the fucking little box and they're like, could I get a, uh,
0:51:08.160000 - 0:51:12.200000::cling on this and then a cup of clam chowder, whatever they want.
0:51:12.320000 - 0:51:14.920000::It just makes it for them right there.
0:51:15.400000 - 0:51:17.840000::It's like a 3D printer kind of thing.
0:51:17.840000 - 0:51:19.600000::It essentially is for food.
0:51:19.760000 - 0:51:20.040000::Yeah.

0:51:27.600000 - 0:51:31.320000::general, sounds chicken and like a pickle, you know what I'm saying?
0:51:31.320000 - 0:51:33.840000::Like, oh, you mean do the flavors go together?
0:51:34.200000 - 0:51:34.480000::Yeah.
0:51:34.720000 - 0:51:35::Yeah.
0:51:35 - 0:51:39.560000::I think at that point because by your, because we're all flavor vendors like, you
0:51:39.560000 - 0:51:43.920000::know, I mean, we kind of see how food like we see through the matrix code a little
0:51:43.920000 - 0:51:46.240000::bit and we're like, actually, weirdly, and I have a pickle to go good on a
0:51:46.240000 - 0:51:47.040000::put peanut butter sandwich.
0:51:47.640000 - 0:51:49.760000::Lala, lala, but it toasted and try that.

0:51:56.880000 - 0:52:00.720000::I think that would make food fucking boring if I could just eat fucking calorie
0:52:00.720000 - 0:52:02.800000::free McDonald's french fries every second of the day.
0:52:03.280000 - 0:52:06.560000::You know what's making me interested in laughing a little bit right now?
0:52:06.760000 - 0:52:07.440000::What's that?
0:52:07.600000 - 0:52:13::What's seeing the reverse angle on Eric right now there in the reflection of the

0:52:21.040000 - 0:52:23.640000::And it also looks kind of funny, but it looks mostly beautiful, man.
0:52:24.960000 - 0:52:25.360000::Wow.
0:52:26.280000 - 0:52:27.920000::Even zoom is cool.

0:53:34.720000 - 0:53:40.120000::I was faceless sleep for about an hour and 45 minutes.
0:53:40.280000 - 0:53:45.960000::And I was welcome by a phone call from Eric because I was late for recording this.
0:53:46.600000 - 0:53:50.560000::So I'm a little bit anti-disestablishment orientated right now.
0:53:51 - 0:53:55::And I don't know what is right for my body.
0:53:55.480000 - 0:53:57.680000::Is it just a two liter of Sprite?
0:53:58.720000 - 0:54:01.280000::Because I also got to pull out all night or tonight because I got homework.
0:54:01.280000 - 0:54:02.200000::I'm not going to say for what?
0:54:02.400000 - 0:54:03.600000::Because we're on strike.
0:54:04.880000 - 0:54:05.640000::I'm scabbing.
0:54:05.880000 - 0:54:10.360000::But yeah, you really have a two liter of Sprite.

0:54:46.640000 - 0:54:49.360000::And it's a beautiful song that he sings about wanting a cheeseburger.
0:54:49.640000 - 0:54:52.200000::Every time I watched it as I was when I was a kid, I was like,

0:56:44.140000 - 0:56:50.940000::Or can you be pleasant and can you be nice and say things with a smile and still have people you have to be a threat of you being
0:56:51.660000 - 0:56:56.660000::Slightly a dick because you don't want to disappoint someone you can respect the nicest person in the world
0:56:56.660000 - 0:57:02.300000::But if you think that you can just push them over and walk over them like a fucking welcome at then that's not leadership
