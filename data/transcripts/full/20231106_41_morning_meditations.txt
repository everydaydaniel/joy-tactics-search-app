0:06:28.320000 - 0:06:31.400000::you're welcome, because this is the best show in the world.
0:06:31.400000 - 0:06:34.240000::But the LA Beast goes down the Columbia, you participate,
0:06:34.240000 - 0:06:36.240000::I don't know, Columbia, because to this place,
0:06:36.240000 - 0:06:39.240000::he participates in a local native ritual
0:06:39.240000 - 0:06:43.400000::where you get fucked up, all fucked up on some Iowaska type drinks.
0:06:43.400000 - 0:06:45.240000::It's like you're kind of a ritual.
0:06:45.240000 - 0:06:46.240000::It's like a kind of a ritual.
0:06:46.240000 - 0:06:48.120000::Now it's the night time.

0:06:48.960000 - 0:06:53.680000::And it's basically the next level bar mitzvah.
0:06:53.680000 - 0:06:55.480000::And you put your, basically you put your hands
0:06:55.480000 - 0:06:57.400000::into these two woven gloves.
0:06:57.400000 - 0:07:03.400000::And inside of these gloves, woven into the gloves are bullet ants.
0:07:03.400000 - 0:07:04::Bull ant ants.
0:07:04 - 0:07:07.640000::And as you are high, these things are biting the fuck out of your hands
0:07:07.640000 - 0:07:10.600000::and then you kind of sing and dance and go in circles and stuff.
0:07:10.600000 - 0:07:14.080000::But the production of it is non-existent.
0:07:14.080000 - 0:07:17.080000::It's like a 2007 YouTuber.
0:07:17.080000 - 0:07:20.200000::And that's the type, basically what made me think is,
0:07:20.200000 - 0:07:25.680000::I miss that what Jackass brought to the world, that real pain.
0:07:25.680000 - 0:07:29.560000::I'm not talking about street pranks like YouTubers
0:07:29.560000 - 0:07:30.880000::where they're being all awkward.
0:07:30.880000 - 0:07:33.040000::And this is not what it's all about.
0:07:33.040000 - 0:07:34.200000::No, it's not.
0:07:34.200000 - 0:07:38.600000::It's really a little bit of real pain for you.
0:07:38.600000 - 0:07:39.720000::That's OK.
0:07:39.720000 - 0:07:42.120000::It's not going to, you're going to be fine.
0:07:42.120000 - 0:07:47.440000::But I would love to infuse some of that onto this topic.
0:07:47.440000 - 0:07:50.160000::What's the most amount of pain you guys would?
0:07:50.160000 - 0:07:54::Indoor, I know Eric, you've already broke your...
0:07:54 - 0:07:55.240000::I'm a guard.
0:07:55.240000 - 0:07:56.760000::To your hand shriek, sorry.
0:07:56.760000 - 0:07:57.760000::I want to talk about this.
0:07:57.760000 - 0:07:58.760000::I'm sorry.
0:07:58.760000 - 0:08:00::I know you.
0:08:00 - 0:08:03.840000::Well, let's talk about some other pain that I don't know if I should fix.
0:08:03.840000 - 0:08:06.040000::When this summer, when I had my sleep apnea attack,
0:08:06.040000 - 0:08:09.320000::because the mass fell off, I rolled over my thumb.
0:08:09.320000 - 0:08:12.920000::And I tore the fingernail all the way back.
0:08:12.920000 - 0:08:15.120000::So my nail bed was exposed.
0:08:15.120000 - 0:08:19.320000::But worse than this, I think I like to spray my thumb.
0:08:19.360000 - 0:08:20.760000::But I didn't realize.
0:08:20.760000 - 0:08:22.760000::And now, if I try to crack my...
0:08:22.760000 - 0:08:24.960000::If I try to like, you know, this, you can crack it.
0:08:24.960000 - 0:08:26.640000::You can really pull down on it.
0:08:26.640000 - 0:08:31.680000::This, if I go like that, intense pain.
0:08:31.680000 - 0:08:34.160000::Seems like something healed poorly.
0:08:34.160000 - 0:08:36.240000::Just what I fucking needed, psych.
0:08:36.240000 - 0:08:38.680000::Well, you didn't heal it properly.
0:08:38.680000 - 0:08:40.400000::You think I need to do a break at home?
0:08:40.400000 - 0:08:41.360000::Needs surgery.
0:08:41.360000 - 0:08:44.240000::Yeah, you have to break it and put it back into place.
0:08:44.240000 - 0:08:45.080000::Yeah.
0:08:45.080000 - 0:08:46.080000::All right, well, you guys can come over.

0:09:47.400000 - 0:09:51.560000::like, oh, this will just, if I just do nothing, this will heal up.
0:09:51.560000 - 0:09:55.640000::Which I'm, which I'm finding out that I just do that with everything, which is bad.
0:09:55.640000 - 0:09:59.640000::So, very bad, especially mentally.
0:09:59.640000 - 0:10:00.640000::But I,

0:10:00 - 0:10:05::I can't really flex my left calf muscle.
0:10:05.960000 - 0:10:07.640000::Like I don't have control of that muscle.
0:10:07.640000 - 0:10:10.760000::So you could never enter a bodybuilding competition.
0:10:10.760000 - 0:10:13.200000::I feel like we have a menthrer shit.
0:10:13.200000 - 0:10:16.400000::And then we take it through the...
0:10:16.400000 - 0:10:19.120000::And then they hear something like this.
0:10:19.120000 - 0:10:21.200000::Well you guys know I had a health scare in college.
0:10:22.720000 - 0:10:25.400000::I was on my way to an improv festival
0:10:25.400000 - 0:10:29.240000::in U of I University of Illinois.
0:10:29.240000 - 0:10:33.320000::And all of a sudden heart pain, intense heart pain,
0:10:33.320000 - 0:10:37.040000::hitting, go to the school doctor.
0:10:37.040000 - 0:10:37.880000::It's not good.
0:10:37.880000 - 0:10:39.640000::I mean they can't tell that anything's wrong.
0:10:39.640000 - 0:10:41.440000::They do the EKG, no problem.
0:10:41.440000 - 0:10:42.960000::So I go anyways.
0:10:42.960000 - 0:10:46.320000::Then I get too high at University of Illinois
0:10:46.320000 - 0:10:47.720000::by smoking.
0:10:47.720000 - 0:10:49.880000::You guessed it, a bubbler.
0:10:49.880000 - 0:10:52.960000::And then I spill the bubbler water all over the bed
0:10:52.960000 - 0:10:54.760000::because it was smoking in it on a bed.
0:10:54.760000 - 0:10:56.400000::And then I have too high.
0:10:56.400000 - 0:10:58.480000::And then everybody leaves the part.
0:10:58.480000 - 0:11:01.760000::And it just me and my friend who stayed to calm me down.
0:11:01.760000 - 0:11:04.200000::And by the way, I think I'm having a heart attack.
0:11:04.200000 - 0:11:06.600000::Well, turns out it wasn't any heart pain,
0:11:06.600000 - 0:11:09.920000::but what I had forgotten was the night before
0:11:09.920000 - 0:11:13.240000::I had been at what place called Flakos Tacos
0:11:13.240000 - 0:11:14.440000::in downtown Chicago.
0:11:14.440000 - 0:11:16.120000::And they had these slippery old,
0:11:16.120000 - 0:11:17.600000::stone steps.
0:11:17.600000 - 0:11:18.960000::And Flakos Tacos.
0:11:18.960000 - 0:11:21.160000::I know it was hidden.
0:11:21.160000 - 0:11:22.840000::It's right next to that soup place where you know
0:11:22.840000 - 0:11:25.320000::that they had all that soup in cauldrons.
0:11:25.840000 - 0:11:28.520000::But as I was leaving Flakos Tacos,
0:11:28.520000 - 0:11:30.840000::it didn't even occur to me that this could cause the heart pain.
0:11:30.840000 - 0:11:33.680000::I slipped on the stone step with my burrito
0:11:33.680000 - 0:11:36.280000::and and smacked my ribs.
0:11:36.280000 - 0:11:37.680000::Burrito alert.
0:11:37.680000 - 0:11:41.680000::Yeah, the burritos are causing me more pain than anything.
0:11:41.680000 - 0:11:42.960000::For years now.
0:11:42.960000 - 0:11:44.800000::You can't go fucking it's haunting me.
0:11:44.800000 - 0:11:46.920000::There was a back going, there was a sideback going on
0:11:46.920000 - 0:11:48::between me and Jack.
0:11:48 - 0:11:49::You won, Jack.
0:11:49 - 0:11:50.520000::And you said you can get.
0:11:50.520000 - 0:11:51.520000::Thank you.
0:11:51.520000 - 0:11:53.120000::You can get in the 10 minutes in without.
0:11:53.120000 - 0:11:55.280000::What do I want to bring up, Brick?
0:11:55.280000 - 0:11:57.280000::Oh my god.
0:11:57.280000 - 0:11:59.600000::That was a great payoff.
0:11:59.600000 - 0:12:02.160000::I should have remembered that pain.
0:12:02.160000 - 0:12:04.840000::Well, you probably had a lot of burritos
0:12:04.840000 - 0:12:06.200000::are doing to me on the hands.
0:12:06.200000 - 0:12:08.360000::Ribb injuries are tough.
0:12:08.360000 - 0:12:12.080000::The ribs are kind of the burrito of the lungs and heart.
0:12:12.080000 - 0:12:14.800000::But yeah, I've been through it, bro.
0:12:14.800000 - 0:12:15.800000::You've been through it.
0:12:15.800000 - 0:12:16.720000::It's not even funny.
0:12:16.720000 - 0:12:20.400000::Hey, I feel like it's only right that I tell an injury story.
0:12:20.400000 - 0:12:22.600000::After you both just told one.
0:12:22.600000 - 0:12:24.120000::OK.
0:12:24.120000 - 0:12:26.760000::So what happened to me?
0:12:26.760000 - 0:12:32.040000::There was a ramp at the bottom of a huge hill.
0:12:32.040000 - 0:12:33.040000::A ramp?
0:12:33.040000 - 0:12:36.160000::A huge ramp, a skateboarding ramp.
0:12:36.160000 - 0:12:39.120000::And there was a crowd that had a mast to watch people go off
0:12:39.120000 - 0:12:40.440000::of it.
0:12:40.440000 - 0:12:44.760000::And everybody was going from about a quarter of the way up
0:12:44.760000 - 0:12:49.440000::the hill, going off this ramp and clearing over a gap.
0:12:49.440000 - 0:12:52.400000::That was quite large.
0:12:52.400000 - 0:12:54.040000::And I thought, you know what?
0:12:54.040000 - 0:12:56.040000::This is how I knew I was a showman.
0:12:56.040000 - 0:12:57.760000::I thought, you know what?
0:12:57.760000 - 0:13:01.520000::I'm not going to go halfway up this hill.
0:13:01.520000 - 0:13:04.480000::I'm going to go to the very top.
0:13:04.480000 - 0:13:06.760000::And this is when I say a hill, this
0:13:06.760000 - 0:13:08.640000::is basically a mountain face.
0:13:08.640000 - 0:13:09.920000::Oh, yeah.
0:13:09.920000 - 0:13:14.520000::And my ego and my, sorry, it's got text message.
0:13:14.520000 - 0:13:21.680000::My ego and my drive for attention sent me into hell.
0:13:21.680000 - 0:13:26.360000::And what I did is I went to the top of that hill.
0:13:26.360000 - 0:13:31.920000::And I sat down on the skateboard like a person in a chair,
0:13:31.920000 - 0:13:34.600000::I guess, all the way down.
0:13:34.600000 - 0:13:35.320000::Hit the ramp.
0:13:35.320000 - 0:13:36.320000::Person in what kind of chair?
0:13:36.320000 - 0:13:39.560000::You're sitting on the skateboard, like going down.
0:13:39.560000 - 0:13:40.080000::Yeah.
0:13:40.080000 - 0:13:41.440000::Instead of skateboarding down the hill,
0:13:41.440000 - 0:13:44.680000::I thought it would be really funny if I just sit down.
0:13:44.680000 - 0:13:47.360000::And that will nullify how high up the hill I went.
0:13:48.280000 - 0:13:52.680000::And so I hit the ramp.
0:13:52.680000 - 0:13:57.920000::And this ramp, I would say, was probably about four feet
0:13:57.920000 - 0:14:00.280000::tall, if I'd, I guess.
0:14:00.280000 - 0:14:01.280000::OK.
0:14:01.280000 - 0:14:04.680000::So it was really high.
0:14:04.680000 - 0:14:08.200000::So when you land, you're going to land like sitting on the board.
0:14:08.200000 - 0:14:09.400000::Like it's going to go like this.
0:14:09.400000 - 0:14:10.640000::Yeah, the board disappeared.
0:14:10.640000 - 0:14:11.960000::But that was the idea.
0:14:11.960000 - 0:14:14.400000::The idea was I'll clear the gap.
0:14:14.400000 - 0:14:15.400000::Land.
0:14:15.400000 - 0:14:16.400000::It's the board.
0:14:16.400000 - 0:14:21.720000::And what happened is I went way too high.
0:14:21.720000 - 0:14:23.680000::The board flies out.
0:14:23.680000 - 0:14:27.640000::I'm spinning on, I'm not on my feet.
0:14:27.640000 - 0:14:31.240000::So I have no control of my axis, where I am, especially
0:14:31.240000 - 0:14:33.720000::to the earth.
0:14:33.720000 - 0:14:39.640000::I fall in between the gap from very high up,
0:14:39.640000 - 0:14:46.240000::lodged in between basically two metal shipping containers,
0:14:46.240000 - 0:14:50.080000::can't get out, call the paramedics.
0:14:50.080000 - 0:14:54.160000::They come, lift me out of this crack.
0:14:54.160000 - 0:14:57.440000::Crab is taking me to the hospital.
0:14:57.440000 - 0:14:58.840000::All busted up.
0:14:58.840000 - 0:15:00.240000::Rescreaming.

0:15:00 - 0:15:01::No.
0:15:01 - 0:15:02::No!
0:15:02 - 0:15:03::No, I was brave.
0:15:03 - 0:15:04::Were you on your phone?
0:15:04 - 0:15:05::No.
0:15:05 - 0:15:06::It wasn't like that.
0:15:06 - 0:15:07::You just said it in there.
0:15:07 - 0:15:08::What were you thinking?
0:15:08 - 0:15:09::What was going through your mind?
0:15:09 - 0:15:10::I was legend.
0:15:10 - 0:15:11::I am legend.
0:15:11 - 0:15:14::And I get to the doctor.
0:15:14 - 0:15:21.240000::And they go, we're looking at your knees, both kneecaps.
0:15:21.240000 - 0:15:26::You have created a fissure in both of your kneecaps.
0:15:26 - 0:15:27::I said, really?
0:15:27 - 0:15:28::Shit.
0:15:28 - 0:15:29::No fucking way.
0:15:29 - 0:15:30::Not both of them.
0:15:30 - 0:15:31::That's not possible.
0:15:31 - 0:15:32::He said, yep.
0:15:32 - 0:15:34::It's a tuned e-fissure.
0:15:34 - 0:15:35::You're a tuned e-fissure.
0:15:35 - 0:15:36::Like, tune a fist.
0:15:36 - 0:15:37::Tune a fist.
0:15:37 - 0:15:39::Tune a fist.
0:15:39 - 0:15:40::A tuned e-fissure.
0:15:40 - 0:15:41::A tuned e-fissure?
0:15:41 - 0:15:49::I don't understand what's going on.
0:15:49 - 0:15:53::I tried to prank you guys with a-
0:15:53 - 0:15:54::Did I getcha?
0:15:54 - 0:15:56::It's a tuned e-fissure.
0:15:56 - 0:16:01::This is not right. You're trying to focus on that.
0:16:01 - 0:16:04::I just got you with the 1910s, these nuts.
0:16:04 - 0:16:07::That's not even like, that was the story.
0:16:07 - 0:16:13::This is what I don't like is that I can't tell what's real and what's not.
0:16:13 - 0:16:14::That was awesome.
0:16:14 - 0:16:19::A lot of people think that it's fun to be a comedian and people think it's all fun and joking around.
0:16:19 - 0:16:27::But you are so tapped out of reality that you don't know what is actually going on in your whole life.
0:16:27 - 0:16:30::You're just constantly questioning yourself.
0:16:30 - 0:16:32::I think it's a joke.
0:16:32 - 0:16:34::You just lied, bro.
0:16:34 - 0:16:35::Here's the deal.
0:16:35 - 0:16:40::Up until the point where I said I fell between two shipping containers.
0:16:40 - 0:16:41::It was real.
0:16:41 - 0:16:45::That's what made me think like, where were the shipping containers?
0:16:45 - 0:16:50::No, but I was saying this was a violence slam.
0:16:50 - 0:17:00::What's fun to think about really is I think back on this is because I did fall straight onto my back, onto the flat asphalt from that thing.
0:17:00 - 0:17:03::I don't think people can quite.
0:17:03 - 0:17:07::By the way, somebody who I don't know has it on video and I've always wanted to do.
0:17:07 - 0:17:08::Are you serious?
0:17:08 - 0:17:09::Yeah.
0:17:09 - 0:17:12::But I've, oh Nate's contact lens reveal.
0:17:12 - 0:17:13::Oh, Nate.
0:17:13 - 0:17:15::He's got the line flavored contact lens.
0:17:15 - 0:17:18::He's got the line flavored contact.
0:17:18 - 0:17:20::The most pointless thing.
0:17:20 - 0:17:23::Let me say this about the story.
0:17:23 - 0:17:24::Sorry.
0:17:24 - 0:17:26::Sorry for screaming.
0:17:26 - 0:17:27::Damn, Nate.
0:17:27 - 0:17:28::No.
0:17:28 - 0:17:29::Watch Eric.
0:17:29 - 0:17:32::Does this make you feel like makes me sick?
0:17:32 - 0:17:33::Yeah, really?
0:17:33 - 0:17:36::The eye shouldn't be toyed with this way.
0:17:36 - 0:17:37::Watch this.
0:17:37 - 0:17:39::Don't let Eric fucking with the way.
0:17:39 - 0:17:41::Why do I want to eat your eyeball?
0:17:41 - 0:17:44::And why is my girlfriend texting me as my face?
0:17:44 - 0:17:46::Oh.
0:17:46 - 0:17:49::Why are you bragging so much on this dude?
0:17:49 - 0:17:51::Your girlfriend is texting you as my face?
0:17:51 - 0:17:53::Yeah, must be nice.
0:17:53 - 0:17:58::You're going to, you're going to, you're going to, you're going to texting you a pizza.
0:17:58 - 0:17:59::I don't know.
0:17:59 - 0:18:01::I can't think of anything.
0:18:01 - 0:18:04::So, but wait, let me, can I put a conclusion on that story?
0:18:04 - 0:18:05::Yeah, please bro.
0:18:05 - 0:18:06::What happened to you?
0:18:06 - 0:18:08::And then I'm going to tie, well, my knees were fine.
0:18:08 - 0:18:10::But I landed smack on my back.
0:18:10 - 0:18:13::And then I was bedridden for a couple of days.
0:18:13 - 0:18:16::And I didn't, I didn't go to the doctor.
0:18:16 - 0:18:17::Yeah.
0:18:17 - 0:18:22::And I thought if an injury like that happened to me older, or I was older,
0:18:22 - 0:18:26::I would be so fucking scared out of my fucking mind.
0:18:26 - 0:18:31::But back then, what, I must have been 15.
0:18:31 - 0:18:36::The concept of being injured, being a bad thing, it was non-existent.
0:18:37 - 0:18:42::It was like, you know, yay, I can't move.
0:18:42 - 0:18:46::What is up with the relationship between fear and youthfulness?
0:18:46 - 0:18:49::They're almost, they're almost intertwined in a way.
0:18:49 - 0:18:52::I was so much more afraid when I was a child though.
0:18:52 - 0:18:55::I think you guys had a different, I was living in fear daily.
0:18:55 - 0:19:02::Afraid of the night, afraid of the adults, afraid of my peers, afraid of my own potential.
0:19:02 - 0:19:04::Yeah, you're unpotential though.
0:19:04 - 0:19:06::Yeah, you might have just had a lot of fun.
0:19:06 - 0:19:09::I was so fucking scared everywhere I went.
0:19:09 - 0:19:12::I was, you know, I do it now.
0:19:12 - 0:19:15::Someone will just like be literally rub my back goodbye, you know.
0:19:15 - 0:19:17::Good to see you, Eric, Flinch.
0:19:17 - 0:19:18::They rub your back.
0:19:18 - 0:19:19::Oh, no.
0:19:19 - 0:19:20::Maybe not on that.
0:19:20 - 0:19:22::I've kind of gotten over that now.
0:19:22 - 0:19:25::But I was flinching.
0:19:25 - 0:19:30::I was a type of kid that was throwing the ball at baseball practice.
0:19:30 - 0:19:33::The minute I throw it, I don't even know where it's gone.
0:19:33 - 0:19:35::But I say sorry, the minute I threw it.
0:19:35 - 0:19:37::You know, the second I threw it, sorry.
0:19:37 - 0:19:39::Sorry.
0:19:39 - 0:19:40::Sorry.
0:19:40 - 0:19:41::You know what I mean?
0:19:41 - 0:19:43::You're the story of someone who's pathetic.
0:19:43 - 0:19:44::No.
0:19:44 - 0:19:50::And now what you're doing with your masculinity is your overcompensated.
0:19:50 - 0:19:51::What do you mean, dude?
0:19:51 - 0:19:52::This is all natural.
0:19:52 - 0:19:57::The hairline, the beard, the deep voice, my interests.
0:19:57 - 0:19:58::This is all natural.
0:19:58 - 0:20:00::Man, everything about you is fine.

0:20:00 - 0:20:06::fucking fake Eric don't even fucking play like that. You actually have the lowest
0:20:06 - 0:20:09.780000::hairline in the fucking world you save it every morning to lick a little more
0:20:09.780000 - 0:20:14.480000::manly. It comes it's like yeah yeah yeah you wax your forehead every morning with
0:20:14.480000 - 0:20:21.280000::hot wax Steve Karel style. No it's interesting to tie it back to the theme of
0:20:21.280000 - 0:20:26.460000::today. Yeah. Which is meditation in the morning right. Morning meditations.
0:20:26.460000 - 0:20:31.460000::Morning. We should never tell Jack what the theme is and you got to figure it out.
0:20:31.460000 - 0:20:35.400000::You have to figure it out. Oh. And that's basically a proxy for the listener
0:20:35.400000 - 0:20:38.900000::because the listeners have in a hard time. I'm fucking understand. I mean, you know
0:20:38.900000 - 0:20:42.440000::what? Oh, I was thinking of this. Can we each say our names real quick because
0:20:42.440000 - 0:20:52.380000::there was there was a whole one second. So fine. Because I feel like there are maybe
0:20:52.380000 - 0:20:58.260000::40 70 800 thousand new listeners coming into the podcast as I recently because
0:20:58.260000 - 0:21:03.460000::the podcast is exploding in ways that people thought would never happen. But we
0:21:03.460000 - 0:21:10.020000::did Spotify is trying to set up meetings with us. And I feel like there I've
0:21:10.020000 - 0:21:13.740000::tapped into podcasts when it's you know five years down the line. Oh yeah. They
0:21:13.740000 - 0:21:18.100000::think that you know they have this there's four different hosts and I don't
0:21:18.100000 - 0:21:22.740000::know who's who and I'm trying to listen. Oh, okay. Is that right? Who's this? So
0:21:22.740000 - 0:21:28.100000::right now who's speaking is this is right now. This is Nate. Okay. Say a little bit
0:21:28.100000 - 0:21:31.620000::about my voice. Say a little bit about this. No, this is Nate. No, this is Nate.
0:21:31.620000 - 0:21:37.260000::Jack don't do this is not the time to break. Dr. Kay. I just entered the chat.
0:21:37.260000 - 0:21:45.740000::Seriously, man. This is Eric. Sticking. So let me tell him it for the Ritzler. Let me
0:21:45.740000 - 0:21:51.740000::catch you guys up a little bit. What does that mean? I just saw that on TikTok.
0:21:51.740000 - 0:21:56.540000::You guys I'm trying to injured myself to the nearest. You guys are just
0:21:56.540000 - 0:22:01.460000::a shot. You should have a shot. Caller Nate for me. I should a long distance
0:22:01.460000 - 0:22:08.100000::shot. Collar LDS. I'll use that a little bit too much. So my name is Nate. I'm
0:22:08.100000 - 0:22:14.540000::from Ohio. I'm 30. I'm currently 34 years old just turned 34. I live in Los
0:22:14.540000 - 0:22:17.980000::Angeles, California. A lot of people think I live in New York. I don't live in
0:22:17.980000 - 0:22:24.420000::New York. I live in Los Angeles. And I have a cat and I am an actor, writer,
0:22:24.420000 - 0:22:31.460000::director, producer, multi-hyphenate. And I'm just having a fun time. How many on
0:22:31.460000 - 0:22:41.860000::TikTok? On TikTok, I have 134,000.7,000 followers. And on Instagram, not so much as
0:22:41.860000 - 0:22:47.120000::much, but still a sizable amount to regular people. People that would be
0:22:47.120000 - 0:22:51.340000::shocked at having that much followers and the pressure that it that comes with
0:22:51.340000 - 0:22:55.420000::that. But to me, it's nothing because I just don't really care about that sort
0:22:55.420000 - 0:23:05.080000::of stuff. Yeah, wonderful. Jack. My name is Eric Rahill. I am 31. I grew up in Edmunds,
0:23:05.080000 - 0:23:12.240000::Washington. I was late off in July. And I've been in a tailspin ever since
0:23:12.240000 - 0:23:17.360000::trying to figure it all out, trying to figure out who I am without the identity
0:23:17.360000 - 0:23:27.040000::of a tech job. I'm finding myself doing this podcast. I'm finding myself to
0:23:27.040000 - 0:23:35.400000::start to take exercise very seriously. And yeah, what else? I don't have, I keep
0:23:35.400000 - 0:23:40.320000::a close circle. I don't like to meet new people, you know? I'm very picky with my, with
0:23:40.320000 - 0:23:44.120000::my new friends. So if you're listening to this and you're trying to come in and be my
0:23:44.120000 - 0:23:49.800000::friend, it's not going to work. You know, it'll take extreme circumstances for me to be
0:23:49.800000 - 0:23:57::able to trust someone new. My name is Jack. This is Master Chief that I
0:23:57 - 0:24:06.040000::drew. He's holding a plunge. And he drew that. Yeah, I drew that. You like that? He's
0:24:06.040000 - 0:24:14.600000::got, I don't think I've ever seen anything that you've drawn. Wow, Jack. That is so he's
0:24:14.600000 - 0:24:22.360000::got that kind of like, that's like if Ed from Big Ed from 90 day fiance was in the
0:24:22.360000 - 0:24:27.560000::Master Chief. Big ass Ed. This is like if that dude from the dude from Adobe
0:24:27.560000 - 0:24:31.720000::Amenis is in the wheelchair. It was a Master Chief. It looks like my character from Baldur's
0:24:31.720000 - 0:24:40.520000::Gate. How's it look up to now? Oh, interesting. Dunk into the acid. That's fun. Can I read
0:24:40.520000 - 0:24:46.400000::you guys a quote? Dude, you don't have to ever ask that, dude. You knew that for real?
0:24:46.400000 - 0:24:53.280000::Wow, I just have never seen your art. That's awesome. It's a tree that I drew. You should
0:24:53.280000 - 0:24:58::draw a hopped down to me, Fer. And by the way, I just have noticed something with the listeners.
0:24:58 - 0:25:00::What? The fan art has kind of been

0:25:00 - 0:25:05.600000::dropping off. Oh, dude, I'd spend really pissing us off off the pod. What is that? What is that?
0:25:05.600000 - 0:25:11.600000::I need to see that inspire y'all visually. And let me say this. People think that fan tip to
0:25:12.080000 - 0:25:18.560000::to create fan art. You have to be good at drawing. No, I can disagree. I can disagree with that more.
0:25:18.560000 - 0:25:25.440000::I want to see your first drawing in like a decade and I want it to be of us or inspired by joy
0:25:25.440000 - 0:25:30.880000::tactics. We need more fan art. It's just like that pencil is pencil drawings on reddit that were
0:25:30.880000 - 0:25:39.200000::really funny. Remember those the subreddit is popping off. The subreddit is all popping off. And don't
0:25:39.200000 - 0:25:44.960000::don't don't limit fan art to drawings. Fan art could be worth. That's me.
0:25:44.960000 - 0:25:57.760000::That's damn it. Hello. Incredible. Here's oh, and they got my portion just right. That looks like us if
0:25:57.760000 - 0:26:04.560000::we were deep see fish. They gave me that big beard. I think in 10 years we should have an exhibit.
0:26:04.560000 - 0:26:11.360000::Just keep pushing for fan art. Pushing for every fucking episode. In 10 years we have a rent out
0:26:11.360000 - 0:26:20.400000::the fucking MCA in Chicago. And we do an entire gallery of just fan art and have the joy tactics.
0:26:20.400000 - 0:26:25.760000::Every tactician that's ever been a patron. We don't care if you've deleted but if you have you kind
0:26:25.760000 - 0:26:32.400000::of get to be shamed by me at the front and you have to pay a little bit extra. And don't get to
0:26:32.400000 - 0:26:38::hang out as long. But if you're a patron of Ben for like 10 years you get to come to this gallery
0:26:38 - 0:26:44.080000::space. There's going to be DJs. There's going to be really really scalding hot wine.
0:26:46.400000 - 0:26:50.880000::And you too. Well, you know what? I've had this quote up on my phone for the last fucking
0:26:50.880000 - 0:26:55.760000::five minutes and I haven't read it. So I need to read this quote. And then I have a scenario
0:26:55.760000 - 0:27:02.240000::to paint your eyes as mine. And then I have something as well. Okay. It's a quote.
0:27:02.240000 - 0:27:08.720000::Something tells me that this quote is going to really, um, well, I'm going to put on my shades
0:27:08.720000 - 0:27:12.800000::for this one. I have sometimes. Now you got the context and you can see through it. How I can see.
0:27:14.480000 - 0:27:24.080000::Okay, this quote says, I was ashamed of myself when I realized life was a costume party
0:27:24.960000 - 0:27:28::and I attended with my real face.
0:27:29.600000 - 0:27:31.600000::Jackie John, friends, sorry.
0:27:32.720000 - 0:27:39.120000::Franz Kafka Kafka wrote that literary writer. Let me try to repeat that.
0:27:42.960000 - 0:27:48.800000::Memory test. If I had to try my best with a knife and a gun in my mouth,
0:27:49.760000 - 0:27:53.760000::oh, you wouldn't be able to talk. Yeah, I couldn't really say it. You have Alzheimer's.
0:27:53.760000 - 0:27:59.520000::I literally guys, my memory is starting to disturb me. I cannot remember, um,
0:28:00.640000 - 0:28:06.560000::nearly anything. What is life is a costume party? Oh, oh, yeah. Life is a costume party.
0:28:06.560000 - 0:28:13.680000::And I realize in our faces, my friends Kafka, right? Yeah, that was pretty much it. Yeah.
0:28:13.680000 - 0:28:21.440000::No. And I have the opposite problem, Eric, when I remember every single millisecond of my entire
0:28:21.440000 - 0:28:25.520000::life to the point where I'm begging to not hear any new information because it feels like,
0:28:26.400000 - 0:28:29.760000::my brain is being stuffed to the brim with oil.
0:28:29.760000 - 0:28:30.880000::You have a great memory.
0:28:30.880000 - 0:28:33.840000::To me? Yeah, I'll answer for you. No.
0:28:36.960000 - 0:28:37.760000::No, not at all.
0:28:37.760000 - 0:28:44.880000::No. Because my memory shot, too. It's just, I'm just fucking stupid, but that's all right.
0:28:44.880000 - 0:28:49.680000::To the point where I don't like, when I think back to when I was 19, I'm like,
0:28:50.320000 - 0:28:54.560000::what did I even like feel like when I was that age? You know, I can't even remember.
0:28:54.560000 - 0:29:00.720000::Like was I, was I having a good time? Was I not? I don't even remember. I remember my overall state.
0:29:00.720000 - 0:29:05.440000::I have an intense emotional memory, intense emotional memory.
0:29:05.440000 - 0:29:11.280000::I have an intense smell memory. Yesterday I smelled like shit at one point and I was like,
0:29:12.640000 - 0:29:20.400000::literally like shocked me back to like having fun as a kid.
0:29:23.040000 - 0:29:28.160000::Jack Johnson does have a song called Costume Party. It's off his new album from 2022,
0:29:28.160000 - 0:29:35.600000::Meet the Moonlight. And let's say you're the only person listening to Jack Johnson in 2020,
0:29:35.600000 - 0:29:43.920000::2022. You know what? When I was when I was younger, I was obsessed with Jack Johnson when I was like,
0:29:44.880000 - 0:29:49.280000::really? When I was like middle school when in between dreams came out. I was on the
0:29:49.280000 - 0:29:57.280000::team. Yeah, let me tell you what I was like on the weekend. And I was obsessed with just like,
0:29:57.280000 - 0:30:00::I used to have this pathetic, let me know if this on the

0:30:00 - 0:30:05.160000::familiar. He's a nepo baby. I don't care if he's a surfer too. No, he's just a surfing
0:30:05.160000 - 0:30:10.960000::nepo baby. He's not. He's dad. The Johnson and Johnson family. Johnson and Johnson.
0:30:10.960000 - 0:30:17.240000::Johnson and Johnson. I spotted out there as a baby. He pays. Blah, blah. It's funny.
0:30:17.240000 - 0:30:24.920000::My plan. The all seen that one. Yeah. Shout out, Gustav A. Cricks. But I used to have
0:30:24.920000 - 0:30:29.840000::dreams like remember it in that remember that movie yesterday where no one knows the Beatles.
0:30:29.840000 - 0:30:34.340000::And so with this guy knows I used to have dreams that I would be playing like Jack
0:30:34.340000 - 0:30:38.840000::Johnson songs at a church town show. But everybody thinks that I wrote them and I sing them
0:30:38.840000 - 0:30:43.760000::in the same way. And so when I went to church camp and I was being all alone, I would imagine
0:30:43.760000 - 0:30:47.760000::myself kind of like blowing everybody away at the town show. But I used to have dreams
0:30:47.760000 - 0:30:52.560000::that have been seven folders covered. Of this album called Meet the Moonlight. There
0:30:52.560000 - 0:30:57.280000::is one really good fucking song for real called Meet the Moonlight. And it's just it's
0:30:57.280000 - 0:31:01.760000::a chiller. Okay. You might be laughing at Jack Johnson. You might think he's Starbucks
0:31:01.760000 - 0:31:07.320000::core. Maybe he is. But this song Meet the Moonlight gave it a chance. Okay. As he evolved
0:31:07.320000 - 0:31:12.880000::at all like is he adding any synthesizer learning? Is he like growing or is he just like
0:31:12.880000 - 0:31:17.400000::a little bit like the banana pancakes? Yeah. We just a pancake. Nothing's happened in
0:31:17.400000 - 0:31:21.680000::the world as change because we're not life isn't all bananas and pancakes at this point
0:31:21.680000 - 0:31:26.480000::anymore. If anything, it's bananas, blitz and pancake, looking in bombs. You want to hear
0:31:26.480000 - 0:31:31.400000::some of the lurch from Meet the Moonlight? Carpet bombs. What? Meet the Moonlight goes like
0:31:31.400000 - 0:31:37.360000::this. Well, it's going to be copywritten man. No, it couldn't be. Oh, let's do it. Let's
0:31:37.360000 - 0:31:43.280000::you a pitchfork fucking gave it by the way. All right. A seven point two respectable. Oh,
0:31:43.280000 - 0:31:48.920000::that's not bad. That's respectable. So tell us a little bit of you guys have some taste.
0:31:48.920000 - 0:31:55.360000::You go the lyrics go like this. You could meet the moonlight any night you really want
0:31:55.360000 - 0:32:04.560000::to just tell us the lyrics don't sing them. It's waiting in your own back yard. You can
0:32:04.560000 - 0:32:12.840000::make the flame meet the killing make the fire. Don't let anybody say it's too hard.
0:32:12.840000 - 0:32:17.400000::He's saying we need to come out with nature and we need to take a just a little tiny break.
0:32:17.400000 - 0:32:22.360000::You can go fucking do that for yourself. Go escape. Go be with the eternal in your back
0:32:22.360000 - 0:32:29.720000::yard. We are closer to the cosmos than we think. We get caught up in our jobs, our spreadsheets,
0:32:29.720000 - 0:32:36.920000::our podcasts, but really the eternal, the strange, the universe is right out there and
0:32:36.920000 - 0:32:44.120000::you can go meet it any night you really want to. X, well, you could, sorry, you could. If
0:32:44.120000 - 0:32:47.680000::corporate greed wasn't holding you back because a lot of people can't do that. A lot of
0:32:47.680000 - 0:32:53.120000::people aren't just some big e-stone or writing songs their whole life. They can't go see the
0:32:53.120000 - 0:32:56.280000::moon anytime because they're working the graveyard shift to quiz nose on the fucking Jersey
0:32:56.280000 - 0:33:01.160000::turn bike. All the folks in Jakarta trying to get all smog out. You're privileged showing
0:33:01.160000 - 0:33:08::man. You're privileged showing. That's a really cute, weird man. This one problem, though,
0:33:08 - 0:33:13.760000::man. You know we were watching last night Nate that's so funny, man. Shout out Nate. Hey,
0:33:13.760000 - 0:33:18.240000::shout out to Nate Verone, one of the funniest people in the world, man. Oh bro, we're

0:33:28.240000 - 0:33:35.080000::day. You're on the whole video as let's do it. I couldn't even begin to. I like.
0:33:35.080000 - 0:33:40.680000::Do you want to be fallen right now? I'm such a big fan of you.

0:33:53.320000 - 0:33:57::could have if I wanted to. This is this is what we talked about potential. How you're scared
0:33:57 - 0:34:04.840000::of your potential earlier air. Yeah. I'm not any more on brazil. Right. That video,
0:34:04.840000 - 0:34:12.280000::if I really wanted to, I could have spun that into a whole universe where if I went deep
0:34:12.280000 - 0:34:17.560000::enough into that universe, I'm fucking shaking hands with Biden at the White House and I'm
0:34:17.560000 - 0:34:23.120000::the Biden gang. Wow. And I'm like, you know, you know, putting it down for him and I'm kind
0:34:23.120000 - 0:34:29.800000::of his millennial voice and putting it down for the only person that really seems like
0:34:29.800000 - 0:34:34.280000::nobody's really on his side lately. Dude. And for reasons that, you know, we don't,
0:34:34.280000 - 0:34:42.440000::I don't want to get into politics right now. But I for I could see that. Me just really
0:34:42.440000 - 0:34:49.880000::having a lunch with Biden that video could have led to that, you know. Yes. Butterfly effect.
0:34:49.880000 - 0:34:54.200000::Jack, I was just watching one of your videos and making me laugh the one where you play
0:34:54.200000 - 0:34:59.480000::that. The neighbor who doesn't is not happy about the noise.

0:35:00 - 0:35:06.680000::And let me tell you what my current landlord they said that they watched that video before
0:35:06.680000 - 0:35:11.920000::approving me as an applicant and they thought it was funny and so they let me move in.
0:35:11.920000 - 0:35:13.440000::I want to see more of that character.
0:35:13.440000 - 0:35:15.040000::Can you do a little bit of that?
0:35:15.040000 - 0:35:16.040000::Can we do a little bit of that?
0:35:16.040000 - 0:35:17.040000::Let's do a conversation.
0:35:17.040000 - 0:35:22.240000::That, inside the actor studio James was his name and I'm like, can we meet James Lipson?
0:35:22.240000 - 0:35:25.640000::Can we meet the neighbor?
0:35:25.640000 - 0:35:26.640000::You want to meet him?
0:35:26.640000 - 0:35:30.960000::Let me just get into the spine real quick because he's a really different type of person.
0:35:30.960000 - 0:35:33.360000::Also Bradley Cooper is an audience.
0:35:33.360000 - 0:35:35.200000::Oh yeah, he's going to ask you a question.
0:35:35.200000 - 0:35:39.560000::Oh, someone just commented on the picture on the air because an incredible actor.
0:35:39.560000 - 0:35:41.040000::Are you kidding me?
0:35:41.040000 - 0:35:42.040000::Shut up.
0:35:42.040000 - 0:35:46.880000::How does that make it feel more than they, more than they'll ever know?
0:35:46.880000 - 0:35:47.880000::Chills.
0:35:47.880000 - 0:35:48.880000::You are two.

0:35:55.360000 - 0:35:57.960000::Hello James.
0:35:57.960000 - 0:36:13.200000::Thanks for having me on as you at least for now because soon I won't be on this show anymore.
0:36:13.200000 - 0:36:14.200000::That's right.
0:36:14.200000 - 0:36:15.200000::I'll be.
0:36:15.200000 - 0:36:23.080000::But it will be fun for now until then while I'm giving you my wisdom until I have to
0:36:23.080000 - 0:36:24.080000::leave.
0:36:24.080000 - 0:36:27.480000::Then you'll be a fool.
0:36:27.480000 - 0:36:29.200000::And where did you grow up?
0:36:29.200000 - 0:36:31.200000::In the shadows.
0:36:31.200000 - 0:36:35.640000::In the shadows of Maryland.
0:36:35.640000 - 0:36:38.640000::Oh my god.
0:36:38.640000 - 0:36:48.720000::In the shadows of, in the shadows of, of what, of, I can't remember this town in Maryland.
0:36:48.720000 - 0:36:49.720000::I'm trying to remember.
0:36:49.720000 - 0:36:50.720000::No.
0:36:51.720000 - 0:36:55.560000::Anyways, so you're not so you're telling me Jack, you don't have a whole sort of borrass
0:36:55.560000 - 0:37:02.200000::style backstory for all your characters where you know, yeah, that's upsetting.
0:37:02.200000 - 0:37:06.720000::Because the Biden gang guy has, I could tell you where he's from, what his favorite food
0:37:06.720000 - 0:37:12.120000::is, what he, what his second grade, he was like, what great, what he was like in the
0:37:12.120000 - 0:37:13.120000::12th grade.
0:37:13.120000 - 0:37:17::I know everything about him before I step into that into a character issues.
0:37:17 - 0:37:19.160000::Nate, and yet this is interesting.
0:37:19.160000 - 0:37:22.360000::And yet you don't know what you were like at 19.
0:37:22.360000 - 0:37:25.600000::Oh my god.
0:37:25.600000 - 0:37:26.600000::That says me.
0:37:26.600000 - 0:37:31.560000::The craft is taken over your body like the Venom symbiote from Spider-Man.
0:37:31.560000 - 0:37:34.040000::You are no longer yourself anymore.
0:37:34.040000 - 0:37:35.880000::You are a fucking alien from outer space.
0:37:35.880000 - 0:37:37.440000::You are a piece of Focaccia.
0:37:37.440000 - 0:37:41.520000::I'm playing Spider-Man 2 right now and you get to play as Venom as the Venom symbol.
0:37:41.520000 - 0:37:42.520000::I'll take it off.
0:37:42.520000 - 0:37:43.520000::You are a child.
0:37:43.520000 - 0:37:44.520000::Bro.
0:37:45.520000 - 0:37:50.420000::When you think I'm playing Spider-Man all day, no, it's after I fucking done all
0:37:50.420000 - 0:37:56.520000::type of job, job interviews with my hands doing manly, all type of adult type of things.
0:37:56.520000 - 0:37:57.520000::I'm sorry.
0:37:57.520000 - 0:37:58.520000::I said that.
0:37:58.520000 - 0:38:04.120000::Then I know Spider-Man is a, I, I forget that Spider-Man is like a good game, you know.
0:38:04.120000 - 0:38:08.880000::Can we do, uh, actually, is, can we do, you guys know the other pot, like a lot of really
0:38:08.880000 - 0:38:15.200000::popular podcasts with like more club, comic type things.
0:38:15.200000 - 0:38:18.160000::They really get down on that bit, you know what I mean?
0:38:18.160000 - 0:38:21.160000::They really get down on some jokes.
0:38:21.160000 - 0:38:26.800000::Could we do like a minute where we're really like giving that energy and, uh, really like
0:38:26.800000 - 0:38:30.880000::going in on like a Spider-Man type of joke like Jared, you're such a kid.
0:38:30.880000 - 0:38:31.880000::Yeah, yeah.
0:38:31.880000 - 0:38:33.880000::Like, you know what I'm saying?
0:38:33.880000 - 0:38:35.880000::Oh, Spider-Man, I'm sick of you guys.
0:38:35.880000 - 0:38:37.800000::But I think I would eat some fucking shit.
0:38:37.800000 - 0:38:38.800000::Go on there, so nervous.
0:38:38.800000 - 0:38:39.800000::Watch this.

0:38:42.800000 - 0:38:43.800000::I was thinking about this recently.
0:38:43.800000 - 0:38:51.400000::What if Spider-Man fucking, dude, what if Spider-Man shot out P out of his tan and this
0:38:51.400000 - 0:38:52.400000::day?
0:38:52.400000 - 0:38:57.520000::Instead of, instead of, instead of, instead of, instead of, instead of, instead of
0:38:57.520000 - 0:38:58.520000::P, man.
0:38:58.520000 - 0:38:59.520000::He was just P.
0:38:59.520000 - 0:39:00.520000::Yeah.
0:39:00.520000 - 0:39:02.360000::And somebody peed on him to give him that power.
0:39:02.360000 - 0:39:07.560000::Yeah, like some radioactive piss hit him on the chin and he was, no, but for real.
0:39:07.560000 - 0:39:09.360000::Have you guys ever peed on somebody?
0:39:09.360000 - 0:39:10.360000::Yeah.
0:39:10.360000 - 0:39:11.360000::No.
0:39:11.360000 - 0:39:12.360000::For real, man.
0:39:12.360000 - 0:39:13.360000::Like I would ask that for real.
0:39:13.360000 - 0:39:16.520000::You guys would be on someone.
0:39:16.520000 - 0:39:17.520000::What do you mean?
0:39:17.520000 - 0:39:21.200000::Like, anyways, we were kind of doing a Spider-Man sort of, oh, and then.
0:39:21.200000 - 0:39:25.200000::Have you guys ever been peed on?
0:39:25.200000 - 0:39:26.200000::You guys ever been peed on?
0:39:26.200000 - 0:39:27.200000::You guys ever been peed on?
0:39:27.200000 - 0:39:28.200000::You guys ever been peed on?
0:39:28.200000 - 0:39:31.360000::I do have a, you know what?
0:39:31.360000 - 0:39:36::Back to the, back to the, back to the, back to the, the real, by the way, you guys didn't
0:39:36 - 0:39:37::like the listeners.
0:39:37 - 0:39:38::You guys didn't like that.
0:39:38 - 0:39:41.400000::Did you, you like us to be real, be ourselves, which is a little bit different than the main
0:39:41.400000 - 0:39:42.400000::stream.
0:39:42.400000 - 0:39:45.480000::I was kind of like, I was liking what Nate was doing.
0:39:45.480000 - 0:39:47::It really made me laugh actually.
0:39:47 - 0:39:48::Yeah.
0:39:48 - 0:39:49::Spider-Man pee.
0:39:49 - 0:39:50::That was good.
0:39:50 - 0:39:53::I mean, his pee is all white like it's a classic.
0:39:53 - 0:39:55::It might be pee.
0:39:55 - 0:39:58.080000::That might, that might be pee.
0:39:58.080000 - 0:40:00::That's white sticky pee because he eats too much more.

0:40:00 - 0:40:06.360000::horsemills and shit. So here's an interesting concept. What? I thought it was
0:40:06.360000 - 0:40:11.080000::thinking last night in my dissection of the English language once again. When
0:40:11.080000 - 0:40:15.200000::you're giving somebody food, you're feeding them. When you're giving somebody
0:40:15.200000 - 0:40:22.840000::drink, what are you doing? Giving them the drink. You're not feeding them.
0:40:22.840000 - 0:40:28.500000::There's no word for it. There's a five. No, it's the de-therification. So what's
0:40:28.500000 - 0:40:33.300000::the word? Because feeding them. What is it? Watering them. You know how you water a horse.
0:40:33.300000 - 0:40:39.260000::Well, maybe liquiding them. Feeding feeding. The point is there is no word. So we
0:40:39.260000 - 0:40:43.740000::can make up one. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. It's up for grabs. Let's get it.
0:40:43.740000 - 0:40:51.300000::Let's think on it. Feed. So what is feed? Feed is food. Sloshing. So that's not bad.
0:40:51.300000 - 0:40:58.740000::What's it called when the hamster has that little bottle? Nursing. Nursing them.
0:40:58.740000 - 0:41:03.220000::Nursing someone. Nursing. But we're using existing words. You know what I'm saying?
0:41:03.220000 - 0:41:07.620000::I see. We need to hold new a whole last new word. Have you guys ever had warm
0:41:07.620000 - 0:41:14.180000::drink? My cow. Straight from the other. Raw and pasteurized. Raw. When you're
0:41:14.180000 - 0:41:17.020000::walking from town to town in France, you're trying to if I can kick out the
0:41:17.020000 - 0:41:21.860000::nuts. The Nazis and you stumble upon a bar and all thirsty and your buddy just
0:41:21.860000 - 0:41:27.300000::died in the parachute and you go and there's a powerful milk maiden and she
0:41:27.300000 - 0:41:33.180000::says come take a drink. I see if she says it in French and she's so sexy and then
0:41:33.180000 - 0:41:36.380000::you guys are gonna put you out. You have all these children. She comes back to the
0:41:36.380000 - 0:41:40.100000::States. You get a divorce. You get addicted to alcohol. She raises the kids. She
0:41:40.100000 - 0:41:44.460000::moves to California. You stay in Nebraska where you're working at the. You
0:41:44.460000 - 0:41:50.100000::imagine that? Maybe a couple. I could imagine a couple images from it but I
0:41:50.100000 - 0:41:53.620000::don't think I could imagine. Your past life. The reality talking right now. Yeah.
0:41:53.620000 - 0:41:58.500000::God. That would be awesome. Beautiful. That's like a loop of French milk maiden bro.
0:41:58.500000 - 0:42:03.940000::The milk maiden. The milk maiden. And she reads to you. She's like a big reader but
0:42:03.940000 - 0:42:13.460000::she works at the milk farm. Oh shit. What just happened?
0:42:13.460000 - 0:42:19.860000::Homework time. What is this? Oh my God. Jack just whipped open a. So I don't think the
0:42:19.860000 - 0:42:26.620000::the people are gonna see this but they won't. I don't think so. Jack. If you share
0:42:26.620000 - 0:42:30.900000::screen it doesn't. No I think they do see if you share screen. Well if not Jack
0:42:30.900000 - 0:42:36.020000::just whipped open a pretty an almost blank Google document and at the top it says
0:42:36.020000 - 0:42:41.720000::Joey. Jack takes intro script with nothing below it and joy tactics outro
0:42:41.720000 - 0:42:47.600000::script. Okay great. So we're about to. Well yeah we're about to do some writing
0:42:47.600000 - 0:42:52.440000::here and I thought um oh here you know what I'm gonna undo this I think it'll be
0:42:52.440000 - 0:42:58.720000::more interesting if it's a Google doc and we can all type in it but I just thought
0:42:58.720000 - 0:43:05.760000::when you were saying 25 minutes ago that we nobody can know nobody knows who we
0:43:05.760000 - 0:43:10.160000::are based on our voices especially if they're new listener we should have a
0:43:10.160000 - 0:43:18::intro. Hi I'm Nate I'm Jack and I'm Eric and you can hold things. I'm gonna play
0:43:18 - 0:43:22.360000::everybody when you guys all fucking fade away I'm just gonna keep. You're gonna do

0:43:31.240000 - 0:43:35.080000::guys because you're so unique and you're not and I couldn't boil you down to
0:43:35.080000 - 0:43:39::just one sort of characteristic. You know what I'm saying because you're so complex.
0:43:39 - 0:43:45.080000::People say we have similar voices but I don't think they're that similar. No they're not
0:43:45.080000 - 0:43:54.200000::similar at all. So much. They're like they're literally everybody do like what what
0:43:54.200000 - 0:44:03.600000::note is your voice that okay so mine is right here. Here's the lower eight. You know

0:44:58.480000 - 0:45:00::we have a joy tactics.

0:45:00 - 0:45:06.880000::Crystal which is a light up crystal with the joy tactics logo on it which is being
0:45:07.840000 - 0:45:09.840000::Given to somebody who wins a thing
0:45:10.160000 - 0:45:14.560000::So what if the thing was that you have you whoever writes the best intro for us?
0:45:14.560000 - 0:45:15.360000::Yes
0:45:15.360000 - 0:45:19.600000::Intro script for us to read and you could send them to joy tactics pot at
0:45:21.200000 - 0:45:25.400000::Great fucking idea and we'll try him out. We'll try a few out next episode
0:45:26.040000 - 0:45:29.800000::Yeah, and the ideas are here. Let's give them some direction a
0:45:30.520000 - 0:45:37.960000::We want to have everybody communicating their name so that people know who's talking in a sense of their personality and a sense of their personality
0:45:39.640000 - 0:45:41.640000::And maybe it's got a noise
0:45:43.720000 - 0:45:48.360000::Like I think of other intros. I think that we just let people like
0:45:49.400000 - 0:45:52.120000::I trust our listeners more than I trust myself
0:45:52.520000 - 0:45:57.880000::I think that we have some of the most creative minds. So we have musicians artists painters
0:45:58.600000 - 0:46:02.520000::poets listening to this some of the most creative people that I I've ever
0:46:03.480000 - 0:46:09.800000::Met in my life our joy tacticians right specifically subscribe to the patreon holy shit. They're sending us their art
0:46:10.040000 - 0:46:17.080000::They're sending us their vulnerability and guess what I trust you guys do whatever the fuck you want with this intro and outro
0:46:17.080000 - 0:46:19.080000::It doesn't even have to make fucking sense
0:46:19.160000 - 0:46:26.600000::It can be in a you could type up something shit in the wingdings and let us in the wingdings font and we could just interpret what we think that
0:46:27 - 0:46:29::actually means
0:46:29.480000 - 0:46:33.080000::I don't know great. That's a great hulu documentary finding mr. wingd
0:46:38.520000 - 0:46:41.160000::That's probably next but you know what I just had another idea
0:46:41.160000 - 0:46:43.160000::Say it now
0:46:43.160000 - 0:46:49.160000::We have a just a fucking Google doc for the patrons that they can just type whatever they want
0:46:51.560000 - 0:46:53.560000::What if someone deletes bro?
0:46:54.200000 - 0:46:59.640000::Welcome to the Google doc I would be disgusting and that's I can't imagine any listener would delete like that
0:46:59.720000 - 0:47:04.680000::Oh, but you can also you can go back in the history of a Google doc. Okay, and you yeah, thank god
0:47:05.560000 - 0:47:11.080000::We should just throw out a blank do Google doc and just be like it's like our discord kind of it's like
0:47:11.160000 - 0:47:13.160000::Oh
0:47:13.400000 - 0:47:16.920000::We have the ancient discord angel doc 1996 discord
0:47:19.720000 - 0:47:26.600000::Can we bring back you know we should do instead of a discord I guess is what right a stand-alone forum
0:47:27.400000 - 0:47:32.760000::Like one of the old for your posting I used to be on a forum site for joint tactics forum.com
0:47:34.440000 - 0:47:38.200000::That would be incredible some of that and we could have like a
0:47:39.160000 - 0:47:41.160000::A professional
0:47:41.240000 - 0:47:48.120000::Area I don't know how these things work never mind Eric. Can you learn can you learn like
0:47:50.200000 - 0:47:54.520000::Well, I know that you've been trying to learn HTML for a long time
0:47:58.040000 - 0:48:01.480000::Yeah, every time you talk to me like how's HTML going? I'm like
0:48:02.280000 - 0:48:07.800000::It's fucking it's I don't know man. It's a complex song. It's like taking me a minute. I'm just trying to like the
0:48:08.280000 - 0:48:14.440000::Like the internet has moved so far past HTML like still trying to grasp the like basics of it
0:48:15.080000 - 0:48:18.040000::H. What's the fuck does that stand for HTML?
0:48:19.800000 - 0:48:21.800000::Helitecnology
0:48:22.120000 - 0:48:24.120000::miracles

0:50:11.360000 - 0:50:12.920000::It's too cynical.
0:50:12.920000 - 0:50:15.440000::It's business.
0:50:15.440000 - 0:50:18.040000::It's business time.
0:50:18.040000 - 0:50:19.120000::All right, not cynical.

0:50:22.320000 - 0:50:26.280000::I remember one of them had a bass guitar that was acoustic.
0:50:26.280000 - 0:50:27.400000::That was a beautiful girl.
0:50:27.400000 - 0:50:28.240000::I believe in my mind.
0:50:28.240000 - 0:50:30.080000::Oh, wrong.
0:50:30.080000 - 0:50:32.200000::I didn't know a bass guitar could be acoustic.
0:50:32.200000 - 0:50:34.240000::I thought it was only an electric.
0:50:34.240000 - 0:50:35.080000::Oh, bruh.
0:50:35.080000 - 0:50:35.920000::You fool.

0:50:38.080000 - 0:50:39.760000::You could have a fucking,
0:50:39.760000 - 0:50:40.960000::what's the most electric thing in the world?
0:50:40.960000 - 0:50:43.040000::You could have an acoustic computer.
0:50:44.680000 - 0:50:45.520000::Whoa.
0:50:45.520000 - 0:50:46.840000::That's a great thing in the world.
0:50:46.840000 - 0:50:48.200000::That's called a brain, bro.
0:50:48.200000 - 0:50:49.200000::Yeah.
0:50:49.200000 - 0:50:50.920000::Damn!

0:50:52.240000 - 0:50:54.400000::The acoustic computer.
0:50:54.400000 - 0:50:55.560000::I like that.
0:50:55.560000 - 0:50:56.800000::Yeah.
0:50:56.840000 - 0:50:57.640000::That's good.
0:50:57.640000 - 0:50:58.760000::That's called a brain.
0:50:58.760000 - 0:50:59.600000::Sssh!
0:51:01.440000 - 0:51:04.400000::Can I say this real quick before we say it with Gavish Joy?

0:51:05.400000 - 0:51:08.200000::So you guys are saying you're not a comedy duo or whatever.
0:51:08.200000 - 0:51:09.560000::Okay.
0:51:09.560000 - 0:51:13.280000::You guys know that Michael Jackson wrote himself a...
0:51:13.280000 - 0:51:14.520000::Michael Jackson?
0:51:14.520000 - 0:51:16.080000::A note or something.
0:51:16.080000 - 0:51:16.920000::Have you guys seen this?
0:51:16.920000 - 0:51:19.880000::Michael Jackson wrote himself a letter?
0:51:19.880000 - 0:51:21.240000::No.
0:51:21.240000 - 0:51:24.440000::When he was in the Jackson Five.
0:51:24.440000 - 0:51:26.040000::Yeah, I know him.
0:51:26.040000 - 0:51:27.040000::I know them.
0:51:27.040000 - 0:51:32.480000::And he was like, I will not be associated with the Jackson Five.
0:51:32.480000 - 0:51:34.600000::For the rest of my career,
0:51:34.600000 - 0:51:37.320000::people will know me as Michael Jackson.
0:51:37.320000 - 0:51:41.480000::And I will ascend to heights that are no one's ever gotten to.
0:51:41.480000 - 0:51:42.480000::Are we?
0:51:42.480000 - 0:51:47.520000::He said, I will ascend to heights that no one has ever gotten to before.
0:51:47.520000 - 0:51:48.360000::Basically.
0:51:48.360000 - 0:51:49.240000::It was basically that.
0:51:49.240000 - 0:51:53.320000::He was just like, I will not be a part of the Jackson Five anymore.
0:51:53.320000 - 0:51:54.320000::Wow.
0:51:54.440000 - 0:51:56.320000::And he was five years old when he wrote this?
0:51:56.320000 - 0:51:58.840000::No, he was like in his kind of teenage years.
0:51:58.840000 - 0:52:01.120000::This was like before like he was about to really.
0:52:01.120000 - 0:52:04.120000::Imagine like a five year old with an ego like that.
0:52:04.120000 - 0:52:08.040000::I think he was trying to escape his evil abusive father.
0:52:08.040000 - 0:52:09.560000::I think you're right.
0:52:09.560000 - 0:52:11.280000::Oh shit.
0:52:11.280000 - 0:52:12.440000::Yeah, that complicates it.
0:52:12.440000 - 0:52:13.920000::But we'll do a whole five part.
0:52:13.920000 - 0:52:15.360000::Yeah, we're going to do a Michael Jackson.
0:52:15.360000 - 0:52:19::I'm like, what's your point?
0:52:19 - 0:52:21.200000::Well, you guys are saying that I'm not a comedy duo.
0:52:21.200000 - 0:52:25.200000::So like, you know, one of you just break, you know, I'm saying that just reminded me of
0:52:25.200000 - 0:52:30.200000::like trying to be like a part of, anyway, it's kind of a tangent.
0:52:30.200000 - 0:52:34.600000::You know, I'm like, okay, I thought you're going to say like you guys should like just
0:52:34.600000 - 0:52:38.440000::put your ego aside and like, no, I kind of have no point.
0:52:38.440000 - 0:52:40.880000::Just reminded me of that thing that I saw recently.
0:52:40.880000 - 0:52:45.680000::We are going to at some point when Joy Tech dates kids were five thousand listeners a month
0:52:45.680000 - 0:52:47.480000::a week.
0:52:47.480000 - 0:52:51.640000::We're going to have to start breaking ourselves away from this, this project because we don't
0:52:51.640000 - 0:52:52.640000::want us to take over.
0:52:52.640000 - 0:52:53.640000::Why?
0:52:53.640000 - 0:52:55.640000::Because it gets too successful.
0:52:55.640000 - 0:52:57.680000::Oh, because we don't want this to be.
0:52:57.680000 - 0:52:58.680000::Who's all of us?
0:52:58.680000 - 0:52:59.880000::I mean, they want to be director.
0:52:59.880000 - 0:53:07.960000::Jack, you want to be a sexual singer and I want to be loved.
0:53:07.960000 - 0:53:08.960000::Just loved.
0:53:08.960000 - 0:53:13.080000::You want to be the government in a different country.
0:53:13.080000 - 0:53:15.840000::I want to be governor of.
0:53:15.840000 - 0:53:16.840000::Yeah.

0:53:20.840000 - 0:53:22.840000::I knew it was coming.
0:53:22.840000 - 0:53:24.440000::That is the worst feeling.
0:53:24.440000 - 0:53:25.440000::That is the word.
0:53:25.440000 - 0:53:26.440000::Say something funny.
0:53:26.440000 - 0:53:27.440000::Yeah.
0:53:27.440000 - 0:53:28.440000::They're listening.
0:53:28.440000 - 0:53:29.440000::400 people are listening.
0:53:29.440000 - 0:53:30.440000::Probably not at this point.
0:53:30.440000 - 0:53:31.440000::30 people are listening.
0:53:31.440000 - 0:53:37.560000::Can we do a whole episode like the like it's we're on fucking the Mark Norman show or
0:53:37.560000 - 0:53:38.560000::whatever.
0:53:38.560000 - 0:53:40.520000::Like the Spider-Man P style.
0:53:40.520000 - 0:53:41.520000::That's what I'm saying.
0:53:41.520000 - 0:53:42.520000::We need to do a whole episode.
0:53:42.520000 - 0:53:45.240000::Where we're just where it's like gun to the head.
0:53:45.240000 - 0:53:46.920000::You got a fun energy up.

0:53:55.800000 - 0:53:56.800000::Shut the fuck up.
0:53:56.800000 - 0:54:00.560000::Eric, you know the energizer bunny right?
