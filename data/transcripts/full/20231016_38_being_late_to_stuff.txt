0:00:27.100000 - 0:00:29.100000::Talk about something.
0:00:29.100000 - 0:00:31.100000::Yeah, something not cool up in the morning.
0:00:31.100000 - 0:00:34.100000::Well, also, I just wanted to point something out.
0:00:34.100000 - 0:00:36.100000::Where were you guys?
0:00:36.100000 - 0:00:38.100000::I'm talking to the listeners.
0:00:38.100000 - 0:00:42.100000::You've done probably a couple things so far today and where have you been?
0:00:42.100000 - 0:00:45.100000::We've been waiting here inside your ears.
0:00:45.100000 - 0:00:47.100000::Waiting for you to arrive.
0:00:47.100000 - 0:00:48.100000::It's good to see you.
0:00:48.100000 - 0:00:50.100000::Good that you made some time for us finally.
0:00:50.100000 - 0:00:52.100000::Yeah.
0:00:52.100000 - 0:00:56.100000::But we're not flicking just chumps that we'll wait around forever.
0:00:56.100000 - 0:00:57.100000::Yeah, that's...
0:00:57.100000 - 0:00:59.100000::You should be listening to this earlier.
0:00:59.100000 - 0:01:04.100000::Well, what the point that I'm saying is you're late.
0:01:04.100000 - 0:01:05.100000::Right.
0:01:05.100000 - 0:01:06.100000::And, um...
0:01:06.100000 - 0:01:07.100000::Wow.
0:01:07.100000 - 0:01:08.100000::You're late.
0:01:08.100000 - 0:01:09.100000::And, uh...
0:01:09.100000 - 0:01:12.100000::Wait, we need to address something real quick.
0:01:12.100000 - 0:01:13.100000::Yeah.
0:01:13.100000 - 0:01:15.100000::Before we get into this, this, uh, this episode and...
0:01:15.100000 - 0:01:16.100000::We do.
0:01:16.100000 - 0:01:17.100000::Eric, do you want to...
0:01:17.100000 - 0:01:19.100000::Do you have anything to say at all?
0:01:19.100000 - 0:01:20.100000::Yeah.
0:01:20.100000 - 0:01:23.100000::Like, is there anything that you have to say to us to...
0:01:23.100000 - 0:01:24.100000::Yeah.
0:01:24.100000 - 0:01:26.100000::Because I feel like they're...
0:01:26.100000 - 0:01:29.100000::I feel like you have sort of a responsibility right now to say something.
0:01:29.100000 - 0:01:31.100000::I just, um...
0:01:31.100000 - 0:01:34.100000::And forgive you if I become emotional.
0:01:34.100000 - 0:01:36.100000::I was...
0:01:36.100000 - 0:01:38.100000::How do we put this...
0:01:38.100000 - 0:01:41.100000::Late as all get out this morning.
0:01:41.100000 - 0:01:48.100000::I woke up in a fucking panic to two missed calls, literally one text.
0:01:48.100000 - 0:01:49.100000::Um...
0:01:49.100000 - 0:01:53.100000::I was 45 minutes late to the record this morning because I have a sleep disorder.
0:01:53.100000 - 0:01:54.100000::And...
0:01:54.100000 - 0:01:55.100000::No, this isn't about disorder.
0:01:55.100000 - 0:01:56.100000::Don't bring that into this.
0:01:56.100000 - 0:01:59.100000::This has nothing to do with any sort of disorder.
0:01:59.100000 - 0:02:04.100000::And be careful because don't start it with that because you don't know what me and Nate are going through, man.
0:02:04.100000 - 0:02:05.100000::So don't...
0:02:05.100000 - 0:02:06.100000::But that's the thing.
0:02:06.100000 - 0:02:11.100000::I do know what you guys are going through because I listen and I'm like all out all times like, oh, maybe they're going through this.
0:02:11.100000 - 0:02:13.100000::I'm not gonna even get fucking mad.
0:02:13.100000 - 0:02:17.100000::I don't allow myself to get mad at you guys because I'm so on your side empathetically.
0:02:17.100000 - 0:02:19.100000::All right, moving on.
0:02:20.100000 - 0:02:23.100000::But no, I was late and I need to own it.
0:02:23.100000 - 0:02:30.100000::Um, there were reasons I was out late last night till nearly 4 a.m. at a party that I shot not disclose.
0:02:30.100000 - 0:02:32.100000::But let's just say...
0:02:32.100000 - 0:02:34.100000::You guys think we like celebrities right?
0:02:34.100000 - 0:02:41.100000::Well, they're worse celebrities of foot at this party and you could say that I was getting pretty close to them physically.
0:02:41.100000 - 0:02:43.100000::Uh, in physical proximity.
0:02:43.100000 - 0:02:45.100000::But not like...
0:02:45.100000 - 0:02:47.100000::You didn't talk to them or...
0:02:47.100000 - 0:02:48.100000::I don't want to disturb them.
0:02:48.100000 - 0:02:51.100000::But they're looking at me like, I should know this guy.
0:02:51.100000 - 0:02:53.100000::And why do I not know him?
0:02:53.100000 - 0:02:56.100000::And I saw them whispering to their agents and pointing at me.
0:02:56.100000 - 0:02:59.100000::Which, uh, and they're security guards, I think, too, pointing at me.
0:02:59.100000 - 0:03:01.100000::So I think that means something.
0:03:01.100000 - 0:03:05.100000::I don't know if that had anything to do with them like wanting to know you.
0:03:05.100000 - 0:03:11.100000::I think maybe it was you just kind of being sort of a disturbance at the party and like...
0:03:11.100000 - 0:03:13.100000::Listen, I'm going up to...
0:03:13.100000 - 0:03:15.100000::Let's just say one of the most famous people in the world right now.
0:03:15.100000 - 0:03:19.100000::Let's just say that and people can guess who I went up to.
0:03:19.100000 - 0:03:24.100000::And I'm saying, I just want to say one thing, Mr. Taylor Swift.
0:03:24.100000 - 0:03:25.100000::He look gorgeous.
0:03:25.100000 - 0:03:26.100000::And Taylor Swift.
0:03:26.100000 - 0:03:29.100000::All right.
0:03:29.100000 - 0:03:31.100000::So a little bit of background.
0:03:31.100000 - 0:03:36.100000::I mean, Eric went to support Sarah last night at the premiere of SNL for this season.
0:03:36.100000 - 0:03:38.100000::Even though Sags on Strikes Not A Big Deal.
0:03:38.100000 - 0:03:40.100000::It's totally cool. They're on a different thing.
0:03:40.100000 - 0:03:42.100000::So we go to the after party.
0:03:42.100000 - 0:03:43.100000::I was there too.
0:03:43.100000 - 0:03:45.100000::Had no problem showing up on time this morning.
0:03:45.100000 - 0:03:48.100000::And then on the way out of the after party,
0:03:48.100000 - 0:03:51.100000::there's like a way to get out that's really crowded and a way to get out.
0:03:51.100000 - 0:03:52.100000::That's really easy.
0:03:52.100000 - 0:03:55.100000::And Eric goes genuinely genuinely.
0:03:55.100000 - 0:03:58.100000::No big air is like, please, please, please, can we go through?
0:03:58.100000 - 0:04:01.100000::Because I need to see Taylor Swift in my eyes.
0:04:01.100000 - 0:04:04.100000::The pathetic.
0:04:04.100000 - 0:04:05.100000::Is it pathetic, dude?
0:04:05.100000 - 0:04:09.100000::Or if fucking, uh, if Cleopatra was around and we're out at a party and we're out at a party.
0:04:09.100000 - 0:04:12.100000::And Egypt in whatever year that was.
0:04:12.100000 - 0:04:17.100000::And you were at a pyramid party with everybody, you know, would you leave?
0:04:17.100000 - 0:04:20.100000::Because you're just a little sleepy or would you say, I need to see this,
0:04:20.100000 - 0:04:23.100000::this public figure with my eyeballs before I get it.
0:04:23.100000 - 0:04:24.100000::Well, this is an amazing question.
0:04:24.100000 - 0:04:26.100000::Let me just get into something that I think is,
0:04:26.100000 - 0:04:28.100000::this is something that I think is brought up.
0:04:28.100000 - 0:04:31.100000::I'm sure there's stories in the Bible that are very similar to this.
0:04:31.100000 - 0:04:32.100000::Speaking of Egypt.
0:04:32.100000 - 0:04:37.100000::Uh, but I think this is a very good example of something for people to think about at home.
0:04:37.100000 - 0:04:39.100000::What are your priorities?
0:04:39.100000 - 0:04:40.100000::Are your priorities?
0:04:40.100000 - 0:04:43.100000::Yes, I'm willing to get home a little bit later.
0:04:43.100000 - 0:04:49.100000::I'm willing to be late for my responsibilities the next day because my priorities are on.
0:04:49.100000 - 0:04:51.100000::Be careful.
0:04:51.100000 - 0:04:53.100000::I'm just going to say what it is, man.
0:04:53.100000 - 0:04:54.100000::A superficial interaction.
0:04:54.100000 - 0:04:55.100000::A superficial interaction.
0:04:55.100000 - 0:04:56.100000::It wasn't even an interaction.
0:04:56.100000 - 0:04:59.100000::It was basically Eric wanted to wipe sweat off.
0:04:59.100000 - 0:05:00.100000::Um, I'm going to say,

0:05:00 - 0:05:02.400000::off his head while walking by a millionaire.
0:05:02.400000 - 0:05:04.960000::I wasn't sweating, I dropped last night, by the way.
0:05:04.960000 - 0:05:08.240000::And that's insulting because that was proud that I wasn't.
0:05:08.240000 - 0:05:09.720000::You guys were all hot and I was like,
0:05:09.720000 - 0:05:11.360000::I don't even feel hot one bit.
0:05:11.360000 - 0:05:12.920000::Let me put my coat on.
0:05:12.920000 - 0:05:14.920000::Usually I'm in these things having to go to the bathroom,
0:05:14.920000 - 0:05:16.760000::put running ice cold water over my veins
0:05:16.760000 - 0:05:18.440000::to try to cool down in panic.
0:05:19.360000 - 0:05:21.160000::Now last night.
0:05:21.160000 - 0:05:24.120000::And by the way, when I fucking do me Taylor Swift like that
0:05:24.120000 - 0:05:27.280000::and we're chilling and I'm pitching her movie ideas,
0:05:27.280000 - 0:05:28.840000::animated Taylor Swift universe
0:05:28.840000 - 0:05:30.520000::that I'm going to be writing for her.
0:05:30.520000 - 0:05:33.640000::I'll be like, you know what's so funny?
0:05:33.640000 - 0:05:35.800000::This is so crazy, but I literally saw you
0:05:37 - 0:05:40.840000::a couple of years ago at the wherever, at that place.
0:05:40.840000 - 0:05:42.640000::And I was like, wherever.
0:05:42.640000 - 0:05:45.440000::And so then I can talk about this hilarious interaction
0:05:45.440000 - 0:05:48.080000::that we had years ago when I was saying.
0:05:48.080000 - 0:05:48.920000::So.
0:05:49.920000 - 0:05:52.560000::I just yeah, you can be like, are you the guy who was like,
0:05:52.560000 - 0:05:54.480000::yeah, I know you, you're the guy who was like,
0:05:54.480000 - 0:05:56.800000::fucking smelling me, like trying to smell me
0:05:56.800000 - 0:05:58.560000::at the party, man.
0:05:58.560000 - 0:06:00.600000::It wasn't the guy that was sprinting at me
0:06:00.600000 - 0:06:02.920000::with your arms down at your sides.
0:06:02.920000 - 0:06:03.760000::Yeah.
0:06:07.080000 - 0:06:08.440000::Oh yeah, everybody's saying you're like,
0:06:08.440000 - 0:06:09.280000::just different.
0:06:10.640000 - 0:06:12.960000::You like drunk drove Sarah from the cast.
0:06:12.960000 - 0:06:15.160000::You like drunk drove her home at night or something.
0:06:16.160000 - 0:06:18.760000::It likes seven, no, Pope operazzi.
0:06:19.720000 - 0:06:22.840000::And if I did do that, that would be on purpose.
0:06:22.840000 - 0:06:25.800000::I'm against the paparazzi like that.
0:06:25.800000 - 0:06:26.960000::Let's just say that.
0:06:26.960000 - 0:06:28.560000::So we'll be fucking careful, man.
0:06:28.560000 - 0:06:29.560000::Let's just say that.
0:06:29.560000 - 0:06:33.080000::Let's just say a camera could be a gun one day.
0:06:33.080000 - 0:06:34.160000::Go ahead.
0:06:34.160000 - 0:06:37.840000::I want to go back for a second.
0:06:37.840000 - 0:06:42.840000::And Jack, you brought up something earlier.
0:06:43.680000 - 0:06:47.080000::And you said that you guys had the same experience
0:06:47.080000 - 0:06:48.440000::last night, correct?
0:06:48.440000 - 0:06:48.960000::Mm hmm.
0:06:48.960000 - 0:06:50.840000::I went to the same party.
0:06:50.840000 - 0:06:55.040000::Yet Eric came 45 minutes late to their record
0:06:55.040000 - 0:06:57.760000::and you were right on time.
0:06:57.760000 - 0:06:58.960000::Why is that?
0:06:58.960000 - 0:06:59.920000::Mm hmm.
0:06:59.920000 - 0:07:01.800000::So you guys have the same exact experience.
0:07:01.800000 - 0:07:04.080000::You're Eric, you're saying you're tired from it.
0:07:04.080000 - 0:07:05.840000::You had to take it nap or something like that.
0:07:05.840000 - 0:07:09.160000::But Jack was on time and he respected
0:07:09.160000 - 0:07:11.120000::that he needed to be here at this time.
0:07:11.120000 - 0:07:11.960000::So what happened?
0:07:11.960000 - 0:07:13.840000::And this isn't going to be a fun episode, by the way.
0:07:13.840000 - 0:07:15.880000::Everybody listening, this isn't going to be a fun one, man.
0:07:15.880000 - 0:07:17.280000::Yeah, this is, yeah.
0:07:17.280000 - 0:07:18.560000::Yeah, this one is going to get into it.
0:07:18.560000 - 0:07:19.400000::This is a drama one.
0:07:19.400000 - 0:07:20.680000::This will probably be our most viewed one
0:07:20.680000 - 0:07:22.840000::because of the drama aspect of it.
0:07:22.840000 - 0:07:23.360000::Right.
0:07:23.360000 - 0:07:24.560000::And I'm not going to say that.
0:07:24.560000 - 0:07:25.800000::Not that I think about views.
0:07:25.800000 - 0:07:29.480000::I don't even know what those are.
0:07:29.480000 - 0:07:32.040000::So why could this be?
0:07:32.040000 - 0:07:35.200000::Well, there's a number of reasons.
0:07:35.200000 - 0:07:43.560000::Maybe my dreams aren't a place I want to be as long.
0:07:43.560000 - 0:07:47.080000::And I'm eager to get out of that universe.
0:07:47.080000 - 0:07:48.920000::So you're saying that if you had the dreams
0:07:48.920000 - 0:07:53.040000::that Eric Ray Hill had, you might be.
0:07:53.040000 - 0:07:55.200000::I think so because I know that Eric's subconscious
0:07:55.200000 - 0:07:59.400000::is a more peaceful place to be based on our music selection.
0:07:59.400000 - 0:08:00.400000::Yeah.
0:08:00.400000 - 0:08:03.040000::Well, what did, oh, no, no, no, no, no.
0:08:03.040000 - 0:08:06.560000::I don't know if that's true because you listened to all crazy.
0:08:06.560000 - 0:08:12.640000::Like, that type of stuff.
0:08:12.640000 - 0:08:13.880000::No, not just that type of stuff.
0:08:13.880000 - 0:08:15.360000::I listened to anything that inspired
0:08:15.360000 - 0:08:17.600000::pain from all regions of the world.
0:08:17.600000 - 0:08:19.440000::I want to listen to.
0:08:19.440000 - 0:08:20.760000::Right.
0:08:20.760000 - 0:08:21.800000::And different genres.
0:08:21.800000 - 0:08:22.560000::So I'll get a lot of.
0:08:22.560000 - 0:08:24.240000::I don't want to talk to the American folk.
0:08:24.240000 - 0:08:25.520000::All right, go ahead.
0:08:25.520000 - 0:08:26.840000::What do I want to do?
0:08:26.840000 - 0:08:29.120000::Strictly Frank Sinatra, you're most listened to artists
0:08:29.120000 - 0:08:30.360000::every year.
0:08:30.360000 - 0:08:31.520000::Yeah, I go through waves.
0:08:31.520000 - 0:08:33.760000::And he is one of my most listened to artists.
0:08:33.760000 - 0:08:34.280000::Boom.
0:08:34.280000 - 0:08:37.280000::Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,
0:08:37.280000 - 0:08:40.680000::but do you have any of your thoughts to think maybe that I'm
0:08:40.680000 - 0:08:43.280000::listening to that calming music to calm a crazier,
0:08:43.280000 - 0:08:45.920000::even more crazier voice than yours?
0:08:45.920000 - 0:08:48.120000::And that's the only thing that will appease the fucking demons
0:08:48.120000 - 0:08:51.080000::that are screaming in my head.
0:08:51.080000 - 0:08:52.080000::Stop it.
0:08:53.520000 - 0:08:54.480000::No, it's crazy.
0:08:54.480000 - 0:08:56.520000::We can't know each other's internal experiences.
0:08:56.520000 - 0:09:00.120000::That's our private lives that we don't owe that a peek into that
0:09:00.120000 - 0:09:00.720000::for anybody.
0:09:00.720000 - 0:09:03.640000::But I'll give you guys a peek and it's not good.
0:09:03.640000 - 0:09:05.720000::Just say that.
0:09:05.720000 - 0:09:07.480000::But so yeah, it is curious.
0:09:07.480000 - 0:09:09.880000::You're maybe you don't like your dreams as much.
0:09:09.880000 - 0:09:11.240000::What else?
0:09:11.240000 - 0:09:12.600000::Why else are we on time?
0:09:14.960000 - 0:09:16::Do you have a schedule?
0:09:16 - 0:09:19.600000::Do you have a calendar, Jack, or why do you have a?
0:09:19.600000 - 0:09:21.600000::How do you kind of?
0:09:21.640000 - 0:09:23.200000::How do you stay on time, I guess?
0:09:23.200000 - 0:09:25.320000::That's probably the reality.
0:09:25.320000 - 0:09:26.320000::Well, you know what?
0:09:26.320000 - 0:09:28::I'll say this.
0:09:31.120000 - 0:09:32.880000::It's a thing of respect.
0:09:32.880000 - 0:09:36::I find respect to be one of my deepest values.
0:09:36 - 0:09:37.760000::And it's a thing of training as well,
0:09:37.760000 - 0:09:41.680000::because discipline is one of my deepest values as well.
0:09:41.680000 - 0:09:47.680000::And I've been in a lot of scenarios where you know,
0:09:47.680000 - 0:09:50.320000::you're showing up to work and you can't be a minute late
0:09:50.320000 - 0:09:52.560000::and you can't be a minute early.
0:09:52.560000 - 0:09:53.560000::You have to be there.
0:09:53.560000 - 0:09:56.280000::Well, it's what scenarios can't you be a minute early for?
0:09:56.280000 - 0:09:57.480000::What work jobs?
0:09:57.480000 - 0:09:59.240000::Where do you not allow to be a minute early for?
0:09:59.240000 - 0:10:00.080000::Well, I was.

0:10:00 - 0:10:07.600000::at a job that was called Stephen Colbert presents tuning out the news. And it wasn't...
0:10:07.600000 - 0:10:13.200000::nobody's... you know, you'd be in trouble if you thought that it would be okay to turn
0:10:13.200000 - 0:10:19.680000::your little camera on and turn your little microphone on. Wow. Men early. They're not
0:10:19.680000 - 0:10:22.880000::going to be happy with that. Entertainment is such a different world than the blue-collar
0:10:22.880000 - 0:10:28.480000::stuff that I'm used to. The blue-collar zooms that you're in. Yeah, blue-collar zooms talking
0:10:28.480000 - 0:10:39.840000::about different type of concrete... man, all was shit. The blue-collar work from home job.
0:10:41.040000 - 0:10:49.200000::Yeah. Well, I need that. You're developing like sedentary diseases, heart disease from just
0:10:49.200000 - 0:10:59.040000::sitting while figuring out what type of tow truck to buy on a zoom. Alright, so let's just...
0:10:59.040000 - 0:11:04.400000::let's put a cap on this energy. So yeah, can we bring it up a little bit please?
0:11:05.440000 - 0:11:09.040000::Yeah, we can. On the Sabbath. We're recording this on the Sabbath and we're coming in with
0:11:09.040000 - 0:11:16.160000::God's house with this energy. Oh hell no. Yeah, it doesn't... I feel like we're going to move on
0:11:16.160000 - 0:11:23.040000::in lieu of a like meaningful song or apology from Eric, but in the interest of exploring the theme
0:11:23.040000 - 0:11:29.840000::of the episode. I said sorry. Alright, alright, alright, my bad. I missed it. So then here's the
0:11:29.840000 - 0:11:39.360000::different types of lateness, right? You can be fashionably late. Oh shit. Being late is not
0:11:39.360000 - 0:11:45.600000::always a bad thing, is it? No. Sometimes you can wear lateness like a cloak. You can wear
0:11:45.600000 - 0:11:53.440000::lateness like a pair of sunglasses. How remove? In a sense, that's sick because you are bending time.
0:11:54.080000 - 0:12:01.680000::You're wearing time. How do you wear time? Right. Or are you doing a bod by the laws of share of time?
0:12:01.680000 - 0:12:07.440000::You don't respect share of time. You respect share of tape, share of fashion and share of
0:12:08.960000 - 0:12:12.560000::share of self-preservation. Do you want to look at that?
0:12:15.760000 - 0:12:21.600000::No, this is this is you guys are wrong. Alright, this is being late is not cute. Alright.
0:12:22.160000 - 0:12:25.200000::If you're one of these kids, you are a nerd, dude. You're wearing glasses right now.
0:12:25.200000 - 0:12:28.800000::You're a nerd, dude. You're wearing glasses right now. I'll kill you, man.
0:12:31.760000 - 0:12:34.800000::Did you see the hat? Are they murderers? No, man. Yeah.
0:12:34.800000 - 0:12:43.680000::So in these days, the being late is not fun. It's not cute. It's if you're late, you are
0:12:44.560000 - 0:12:51.120000::you're stopping the world. It's selfish. Okay. It's honestly it's selfish and it's disgusting.
0:12:51.120000 - 0:12:57.200000::And if you're one of those people out there that is always late for stuff that can never be on time.
0:12:57.200000 - 0:13:02.080000::You know how easy it is to just be on time. Yeah, easy that is.
0:13:03.440000 - 0:13:07.760000::Can we check your privilege though really quick because yeah, for you, it might be easy because
0:13:07.760000 - 0:13:11.920000::you just have to sit around all day and do the right type of show or going to incline and walk
0:13:11.920000 - 0:13:18.160000::on the treadmill and and make your rice bowl with the, you know what I mean? There's a lie.
0:13:21.760000 - 0:13:28.080000::Might be single mothers or even more interestingly single fathers that are running around trying
0:13:28.080000 - 0:13:31.840000::to take care of the household. Do this and that then going to volunteering then going to this and
0:13:31.840000 - 0:13:37.760000::that and maybe the dinner that they're having with you to discuss the pilot that's never going to
0:13:37.760000 - 0:13:45.200000::get launched at 6 p.m. Nate is less important than getting that getting that one-on-one father-son time
0:13:45.200000 - 0:13:50.240000::in. You know what I'm saying? Right. So why aren't you around with no kids? You're setting all your
0:13:50.240000 - 0:13:56.320000::meetings that start at 7 p.m. basically is when your work day starts you pull up in your Miserati to
0:13:56.320000 - 0:13:59.840000::you know, by the way, you don't even have to drive to work because your office is in the back of your
0:13:59.840000 - 0:14:07.440000::house but you still like to get in your Miserati. Just go out into the fucking road, burn out, put
0:14:07.440000 - 0:14:12.720000::on the loudest music you can and do a couple donuts. Just so that there's enough smoke so that when
0:14:12.720000 - 0:14:18::you pull in back into the office it looks cool when you come out of the smoke and then you get in the
0:14:18 - 0:14:25.440000::office and you do schedule meetings with only people who are living in abject poverty which I find
0:14:25.440000 - 0:14:32.800000::interesting. Yeah. It feels like everybody that you do business with it's like you call them up
0:14:32.800000 - 0:14:36::beforehand and be like, hey there's no public transportation here you're right. All right, all right,
0:14:36 - 0:14:40.880000::cool cool cool. Well it's because I want to give opportunities to these people. Right.
0:14:40.880000 - 0:14:44.880000::You're making a documentary about poor people and then you just ask them how much money they make
0:14:44.880000 - 0:14:51.520000::and then you're behind the camera going, which I stitched to many people I've shown them
0:14:51.520000 - 0:14:56.080000::that cuts to many people and they're like, is there any more to this? Because it's like three hours
0:14:56.080000 - 0:15:00::of just the same thing. There's no

0:15:00 - 0:15:15::story. Yeah, that's interesting though. Lateness or punctuality is a privilege. Well,
0:15:15 - 0:15:23.520000::what you just described this this whole privilege thing with a single mother and father. You are
0:15:23.520000 - 0:15:29.920000::placing that there is more of an importance on your children than there is this business meeting.
0:15:29.920000 - 0:15:34.960000::Okay, which some people might agree with family is more important than business. Right. All right,
0:15:34.960000 - 0:15:42.640000::but I think that you should treat every person in your life with the equal amount of give them
0:15:42.640000 - 0:15:48.400000::the equal amount of energy. Okay, so your children are getting the same attention and energy as your
0:15:48.400000 - 0:15:55.520000::coworker as your boss as the cashier at the Dollar Tree store. Okay, what if you just live that
0:15:55.520000 - 0:16:01.120000::life for just one fucking second? Yeah, see what we'll change. Yeah, if you just treat everybody
0:16:01.120000 - 0:16:08.160000::equally instead of seeing everybody as as a lesser than all this person doesn't deserve. No,
0:16:10.240000 - 0:16:15.440000::treat everybody equally. All right. Now here's a question because what if where are you setting the
0:16:15.440000 - 0:16:20.240000::bar for equality? Because okay, I'm going to treat everybody equally as I treat my family,
0:16:20.240000 - 0:16:26.560000::but guess what? What if everybody I gave birth to is a fucking psycho like Waiolkaio. You know what I'm
0:16:26.560000 - 0:16:30.400000::saying? So okay, I'm going to treat everybody else in the world as I would treat Tasmanian devil.
0:16:30.400000 - 0:16:34.080000::I'm sorry all my references are from the Lune Tunis universe, but that's what I'm studying.
0:16:34.080000 - 0:16:39.200000::Well, that's the only show you've seen. That's the only show I've ever seen. That's okay. That's
0:16:39.200000 - 0:16:43.440000::all right. That's your only right. You were spending a lot of time in the hospital. They only had that
0:16:43.440000 - 0:16:49.360000::one TV, that one channel. Yeah. What if it's a customer service representative for an airline
0:16:49.360000 - 0:16:55.440000::and there's some fucked up thing with the points? Let's move on to a different topic of conversation.
0:16:55.440000 - 0:17:02.160000::That's where I draw the line right here. I'm drawing the line right now. No, because they're in a
0:17:02.160000 - 0:17:07.360000::different category of person. A cut that you can treat everybody in the world separately, but
0:17:07.680000 - 0:17:17.200000::people in the customer service industry who work for either Chase Bank or an airline, they deserve hell
0:17:17.200000 - 0:17:22.640000::on earth. And they're just in a certain category where you can treat them like the fucking dogs
0:17:22.640000 - 0:17:27.520000::that they are. All right. Because they are kind of like a representation of the corporation and the
0:17:27.520000 - 0:17:35.440000::prop until they figure out how to make customer service more pleasant. Okay. Because right now we're
0:17:35.440000 - 0:17:40.800000::in more better because right now we're in this disgusting era where customer service is just
0:17:41.600000 - 0:17:46.240000::it's just so hard to get to the person that you need to and there's transfers. It's just so
0:17:46.240000 - 0:17:53.040000::disgusting that we need to treat this whole industry like they are peasants like they are fucking
0:17:53.040000 - 0:18:00.320000::and I don't care who who's behind the the line here. All right. That's very brave of you to call it
0:18:00.320000 - 0:18:07.920000::out man. Nobody's a nobody's saying shit in my corner of the world, but we're gonna change it
0:18:07.920000 - 0:18:16.320000::mark my words. Check this out. What's that baby? So I'll just put a baby emoji up in the corner of my
0:18:16.320000 - 0:18:23.360000::zoom window. And here's why because I just had a new I just gave birth to an idea a business idea.
0:18:23.360000 - 0:18:28.960000::So you all are familiar with the physical activity. What do they call it? Like a breaking room where
0:18:28.960000 - 0:18:35.040000::you go and you can smash the shit to get your rage out. Oh yeah. So what I am saying is basically the
0:18:35.040000 - 0:18:39.680000::emotional version of that where you can walk into like a set of a home and we'll be in there like
0:18:39.680000 - 0:18:44.560000::pretending to be your husband or something and you can come home and just like fucking give it to us.
0:18:44.560000 - 0:18:47.760000::You motherfucking hell is fucking late. I can't do this anymore.
0:18:50.480000 - 0:18:56::And you can just go in emotionally so it's an emotional break room. All better off things that are
0:18:56 - 0:19:01.920000::not acceptable. And we can do nothing. And maybe it's physical too. So it's both of them. You can
0:19:01.920000 - 0:19:06.800000::break. I feel like you should be able to shake them. You should be able to shake the actors or set us on
0:19:06.800000 - 0:19:13.760000::fire where we're in those like huge fireproof like these movies. It should be a stunt. Like a stunt
0:19:13.760000 - 0:19:19.040000::like everybody who is like the actors, they are hired stunt people and everything in the room
0:19:19.040000 - 0:19:23.440000::is break away. So you can like smash them on the tables and break lamps over their head. Like
0:19:23.520000 - 0:19:28.480000::everything is up for grabs and you can keep the fuck and scream the fuck at somebody. And if you
0:19:28.480000 - 0:19:34.480000::have money like that and you give us enough time ahead of time, we will do a 3D rendering and
0:19:35.120000 - 0:19:39.200000::print prosthetics of whoever you want to beat the fuck out of it. And put that on his head.
0:19:39.200000 - 0:19:44.160000::And we will study their dialect and we'll just fucking like no for you 100%.
0:19:46.160000 - 0:19:50.800000::And it'll we can you can really have memories too. So if it was 1973 and you and your grandma's
0:19:50.800000 - 0:19:56.560000::kitchen that smells like I don't know how are they getting them kitchens and our grandparents
0:19:56.560000 - 0:20:00::houses smelled so different than any houses. I bet

0:20:00 - 0:20:04.040000::I think the balls have a ball.

0:24:41.240000 - 0:24:44.880000::And I was thinking, as I always do, dang, wouldn't it be nice if we like, yeah, I'm
0:24:45.880000 - 0:24:47.880000::sure there was nothing.
0:24:47.880000 - 0:24:56.080000::I don't know if the word is societal or social, socially, and plicatory about what if you're
0:24:56.080000 - 0:25:00::wearing gems, it's just like you are like you are expected as

0:25:00 - 0:25:09.440000::a reptile and a rainbow trout has scales as you are expected to explore a shiny shit on yourself.
0:25:09.440000 - 0:25:15.840000::And perhaps there's no evolutionary point to this for human beings, but wouldn't it just,
0:25:15.840000 - 0:25:19.760000::I don't know, I don't know because that could lose the beauty if it was more.
0:25:19.760000 - 0:25:24.560000::Well, let me lay it out for you guys. We're looking in the windows at all this expensive jewelry,
0:25:24.560000 - 0:25:30.720000::and I like to play games with people like that. I'm like, guys, pick out one piece of jewelry that
0:25:30.720000 - 0:25:34.880000::you would really love to watch. So I like to bring that that's the generosity of my spirit is
0:25:34.880000 - 0:25:40.480000::bringing that type of fun to just regular encounters. And Jack keeps picking out, we go to do this
0:25:40.480000 - 0:25:47.600000::at all the windows. Jack keeps picking out these extravagant gems, necklaces, bracelets. He's like,
0:25:47.600000 - 0:25:53.760000::I like those shiny gems. And I'm like, you think you got to wear this,
0:25:54.560000 - 0:26:00.720000::get the gems, man. Get the once we get that once we hit that thousand patron a month mark,
0:26:00.720000 - 0:26:06.720000::let me just say get the gems, dude. You need them. What do you mean gems? Is it like a thick,
0:26:06.720000 - 0:26:15.200000::like necklace with like a jam or there was a thick cube of amber, a deep Jurassic Park style cube
0:26:15.200000 - 0:26:20.720000::that has the fucking little mosquito in it. Remember that? Yeah. They've made dinosaurs from one
0:26:20.720000 - 0:26:26.240000::drop of blood from a mosquito. Miss me with that fake science. What never missed me with that
0:26:26.240000 - 0:26:33.200000::blood. Yes, miss. Oh, one by the way, when Jurassic Park came out, we didn't know what evolution was.
0:26:33.200000 - 0:26:40.400000::Do you know that? The theory of evolution came out. The theory of evolution came out after Jurassic Park.
0:26:41.040000 - 0:26:47.440000::Did it? I know. It's Charles. Something like that. I'm no, okay, totally that can't be that. So
0:26:47.440000 - 0:26:55.200000::not sure. I don't think that might do. They're going to bring this up. But it's but it's something like that.
0:26:57.280000 - 0:27:04.080000::Sure. No, no, no, no, it's something like we didn't know how long ago dinosaurs were existing
0:27:04.080000 - 0:27:09.840000::or something. It's some big piece of knowledge that we were missing. Maybe there's some sort of
0:27:09.840000 - 0:27:15.760000::information that was found out after that. But I think I think for the most part, like we kind of
0:27:15.760000 - 0:27:23.360000::had the whole dinosaurs and evolution figured out figured out. Let me be right back. Since like the 1800s.
0:27:24.160000 - 0:27:29.440000::Let me be right back. Okay. Well, let's go back to what kind of drip Nate. Nate wants.
0:27:29.440000 - 0:27:36.400000::Well, can I tell this? Well, okay. Yeah, you can. So I'm trying to re-drupe myself. And I mentioned
0:27:36.400000 - 0:27:44.320000::these shoes on the on a previous episode. They're some A6. And people were sending me messages. People
0:27:44.320000 - 0:27:48.960000::were like, you should get those shoes. Like go go do it. You're not I was saying to my two bald
0:27:48.960000 - 0:27:56.160000::for this and my two, you know, whatever. Perfect to lame. So I was I got some encouragement from the
0:27:56.160000 - 0:28:02::from the fans. And I was like, you know what? I'm going to get these shoes. And there was a drop
0:28:02 - 0:28:06.480000::date for the shoes. Okay. So they had been released yet. It was like going to be released on
0:28:07.200000 - 0:28:13.760000::the 13th of October. So there's a couple of days ago. I woke up at the exact time that it was
0:28:13.760000 - 0:28:19.600000::like going to drop because I was like, I kind of forgot that fucking sneaker heads are just the
0:28:19.600000 - 0:28:26.400000::fucking worst people on the planet. And I was like, all right, I'm going to wake up like at this time
0:28:26.400000 - 0:28:32.480000::and go to the website at 8 a.m. or whatever when it's when it drops. And I was I won the website like

0:28:54.400000 - 0:28:59.760000::From the irregular as the guy who just wants a pair of shoes. Nothing. Who is on the brink?
0:28:59.760000 - 0:29:04.880000::Who is on a nice edge of sanity that if you don't get one win, it's right. I don't get one.
0:29:04.880000 - 0:29:09.680000::And you're taking it. It's just a clean. You could resell these fucking shoes for $700. That's what

0:29:27.600000 - 0:29:34.240000::Jurassic Park came out before the theory of the asteroid. They didn't know how
0:29:34.240000 - 0:29:39.600000::dinosaurs that had been killed yet. Before the theory. Imagine that in the
0:29:39.600000 - 0:29:44.160000::Jurassic Park that it was an asteroid. No, this is something that I've researched with my girlfriend
0:29:44.160000 - 0:29:50.480000::that we figured out. Because listen to this asteroid. When the impact theory thing.

0:30:11.440000 - 0:30:15::Keep us to keep us rest of what you're thinking and feeling there was a
0:30:18.720000 - 0:30:22.880000::There's a paper that somebody wrote called the Alvarez paper
0:30:24.880000 - 0:30:27.360000::You thought I was a new paper called the Alvarez paper
0:30:27.360000 - 0:30:30.720000::The guy who's name was Alvarez paper
0:30:36.720000 - 0:30:41.760000::All right, so moving on that first theorize that the dinosaurs had died an asteroid impact
0:30:42.240000 - 0:30:43.760000::Okay, no one's a trash
0:30:45.360000 - 0:30:47.360000::I can't already know it wasn't before
0:30:48.960000 - 0:30:52.880000::This is humiliating your hazard bark about 1990 what one
0:30:53.360000 - 0:31:03.040000::This is humiliating so I'm wrong. It's okay, man. Dude. It's okay asteroid. You were late to that knowledge
0:31:03.600000 - 0:31:09.360000::Okay, and we forgive you we forgive your mental tardiness. I think tardy is an insult
0:31:10.640000 - 0:31:12.640000::What's up tardy?
0:31:14.240000 - 0:31:16.240000::No
0:31:16.240000 - 0:31:18.240000::That was crazy now I'm lightheaded
0:31:19.200000 - 0:31:21.920000::So now what shall we discuss?
0:31:27.840000 - 0:31:30.400000::Okay, so just based on the dinosaurs
0:31:31.280000 - 0:31:33.840000::My dad told me when I was a kid I
0:31:34.720000 - 0:31:37.280000::grew up thinking that dinosaurs and
0:31:38.080000 - 0:31:40.320000::That the prehistoric period in my head
0:31:41.120000 - 0:31:45.040000::from what my father had told me as a very religious person
0:31:45.760000 - 0:31:51.520000::Was that when the dinosaurs were around the earth was filled with angels and
0:31:52.720000 - 0:31:53.920000::um
0:31:53.920000 - 0:31:59.280000::It's sort of ancient angelic heavenly beings and then they lived on us
0:32:00.080000 - 0:32:07.200000::At the same time as the dinosaurs. Oh, and that's what the kind of prehistoric area. So in my childhood
0:32:07.920000 - 0:32:10.320000::brain I thought
0:32:10.320000 - 0:32:14.160000::Dinosaurs and then right next to them I was seeing angels
0:32:14.720000 - 0:32:15.760000::Yeah
0:32:15.760000 - 0:32:21.040000::Isn't that fucked up and then I found out all that's probably not the well. That's definitely not what that's big
0:32:21.760000 - 0:32:25.200000::Would actually happen you you laugh at how fantastical that be but
0:32:27.120000 - 0:32:29.520000::But it could maybe it's not that far off dude
0:32:30.560000 - 0:32:33.600000::Maybe that maybe maybe it's not that far off
0:32:34.160000 - 0:32:41.200000::You think because you realize a little far off you think like it's not quite any we don't know if there's angels
0:32:41.760000 - 0:32:43.760000::You don't know
0:32:44.560000 - 0:32:48.240000::I know there's angels I know there's angels don't have about dude they're gashes
0:32:49.840000 - 0:32:51.040000::gasses
0:32:51.040000 - 0:32:52.560000::They're gaseous
0:32:52.560000 - 0:32:55.440000::They're gaseous creatures they smell like fucking shit, but they are holy
0:32:58.400000 - 0:33:01.520000::They're holy holy creatures. I could see that with some dinosaurs
0:33:02.720000 - 0:33:06::But you know that we're kind of guessing what them dinosaurs look like right
0:33:06.880000 - 0:33:10.320000::They only recently put feathers on them because they're like oh they they have that bird
0:33:11.120000 - 0:33:13.520000::So dinosaurs were birds what else are we gonna discuss
0:33:14.880000 - 0:33:20.160000::It's guess what else have you been lied to about what is what what else is gonna shatter our fucking current knowledge?
0:33:20.160000 - 0:33:25.440000::Well the current thing you know what I'm saying. I don't think this is the first advanced society. I'll just say that
0:33:26.800000 - 0:33:28.800000::I'll leave you with that

0:35:10.040000 - 0:35:11.040000::No, but it sounds amazing.
0:35:11.040000 - 0:35:18.440000::Where Lex Friedman asked Joe Rogan, he says, do you think that the CIA has been in contact
0:35:18.440000 - 0:35:20.440000::with you, Joe Rogan?
0:35:20.440000 - 0:35:23.280000::And he says, I know they have.
0:35:23.280000 - 0:35:26.480000::They're trying to infiltrate my podcast.
0:35:26.480000 - 0:35:32.400000::He says, has there been a guest on that you think has been had a sort of CIA ties and
0:35:32.400000 - 0:35:34.720000::they're trying to push some sort of narrative?
0:35:34.720000 - 0:35:39.240000::And he said, yep, I think I'm pretty sure there has been.
0:35:39.240000 - 0:35:41.520000::And I've been getting fucked with.
0:35:41.520000 - 0:35:42.520000::Amy Klubbuchar.
0:35:42.520000 - 0:35:43.520000::It's Klubbuchar.
0:35:43.520000 - 0:35:44.520000::Amy Klubbuchar.
0:35:44.520000 - 0:35:50.720000::Can I say when you said there was a guest that has been playing about the CIA, not ironically
0:35:50.720000 - 0:35:51.960000::got chills.
0:35:51.960000 - 0:35:55.800000::I get chills pretty easily.
0:35:56.800000 - 0:35:59.960000::But I think it means I used to think that man I was communing with God.
0:35:59.960000 - 0:36:00.960000::I told you this.
0:36:00.960000 - 0:36:06.360000::I thought I was one of God's chosen because every time I pray, that chills more often.
0:36:06.360000 - 0:36:07.360000::Full body chills.
0:36:07.360000 - 0:36:12.480000::And my mom was like, I know that chills when I see candy for real.
0:36:12.480000 - 0:36:13.880000::Oh yeah, so we just have different priorities.
0:36:13.880000 - 0:36:15.640000::Back to priorities are priorities are different.
0:36:15.640000 - 0:36:18.640000::I don't know what the eternal holy in years and with some sugar.
0:36:18.640000 - 0:36:19.640000::For labor.
0:36:19.640000 - 0:36:20.640000::Treats for losers.
0:36:20.640000 - 0:36:23.640000::Well, all right, man, I don't disrespect your God.
0:36:23.640000 - 0:36:27.440000::I don't know why it just goes back mine.
0:36:27.440000 - 0:36:29::Wait, I want to hear your prayer.
0:36:29 - 0:36:31.960000::Can I hear a prayer of yours, Eric, and just see what you think?
0:36:31.960000 - 0:36:33.280000::Mine, back trying.
0:36:33.280000 - 0:36:39::Mine, they were so casual, it was like, because I would try to talk to God like we were
0:36:39 - 0:36:42.560000::friends, because I was terrified by him.
0:36:42.560000 - 0:36:43.560000::And you guys are enemies.
0:36:43.560000 - 0:36:44.560000::You say what?
0:36:44.560000 - 0:36:45.560000::I would have.
0:36:45.560000 - 0:36:50.200000::Well, I would pray to Jesus because we were taught the God of the Old Testament was
0:36:50.200000 - 0:36:51.200000::wrathful.
0:36:51.200000 - 0:36:54.760000::And he used a, that's why he brought, sent Jesus down because he couldn't rock with
0:36:54.760000 - 0:36:59.200000::the humans because he was so fucking powerful and crazy as I'll get out.
0:36:59.200000 - 0:37:02.080000::And then if San Diego is down, who's kind of got it like that.
0:37:02.080000 - 0:37:07.240000::So I was never praying to the Jewish God who, Jack, I know your ass is prayed too many times
0:37:07.240000 - 0:37:08.240000::for.
0:37:08.240000 - 0:37:09.240000::It works.
0:37:09.240000 - 0:37:10.240000::That's shit.
0:37:10.240000 - 0:37:11.240000::Yeah.
0:37:11.240000 - 0:37:12.240000::In a different way.
0:37:12.240000 - 0:37:13.240000::That shit does work, I think.
0:37:13.240000 - 0:37:14.560000::And oh, that shit does actually work.
0:37:14.560000 - 0:37:17.280000::I mean, because you guys are saying the right words that I don't understand.
0:37:17.280000 - 0:37:20::Yeah, you could never say Shema.
0:37:20 - 0:37:22.240000::And, no, I couldn't.
0:37:22.240000 - 0:37:28.280000::But I was talking to Jesus like, dear Jesus, like, please, like, let me make some friends.
0:37:28.280000 - 0:37:29.280000::Yeah.
0:37:29.280000 - 0:37:36.680000::Let me just like, let me build up the courage to talk to getting full body chills.
0:37:36.680000 - 0:37:37.680000::Yeah.
0:37:37.680000 - 0:37:44.080000::Well, I told the story to where I became atheist for a second and then went to a museum
0:37:44.080000 - 0:37:47.560000::in Washington DC while I was listening to my iPod mini.
0:37:47.560000 - 0:37:53::And I'm sure to like, you know, feist was playing something like this was playing
0:37:53 - 0:37:56.200000::my ears and I stumbled into a dark room.
0:37:56.200000 - 0:37:58.480000::And in the room was medieval art.
0:37:58.480000 - 0:38:06.520000::And there was a tiny literally like eight inch by eight inch picture of Jesus on the cross.
0:38:06.520000 - 0:38:07.520000::And it's dark room.
0:38:07.520000 - 0:38:11.880000::And I went and I was drawn to the photo and I saw him on the cross.
0:38:11.880000 - 0:38:14.080000::And I just like full body chills again.
0:38:14.080000 - 0:38:16.640000::I was like, I cannot believe why I was forsaken God.
0:38:16.720000 - 0:38:18.400000::I cannot believe I've made this choice.
0:38:18.400000 - 0:38:21.360000::He died for me individually.
0:38:21.360000 - 0:38:22.840000::I fucked up so bad.
0:38:22.840000 - 0:38:24.880000::And then I was Christian again for a little bit bit.
0:38:24.880000 - 0:38:27.600000::And then I started getting back into porn and I gave it up.
0:38:27.600000 - 0:38:29.600000::But there was a minute.
0:38:29.600000 - 0:38:30.600000::This Christian porn.
0:38:30.600000 - 0:38:31.600000::This is great.
0:38:31.600000 - 0:38:34.600000::There if there is there.
0:38:34.600000 - 0:38:37.600000::There are blasphemists.
0:38:37.600000 - 0:38:38.600000::Not real.
0:38:38.600000 - 0:38:39.600000::They're okay.
0:38:39.600000 - 0:38:43::Anyway, I had to wash an in DC.
0:38:43 - 0:38:44::Shout out to the museums.
0:38:44 - 0:38:48.560000::If anybody listening is under 21 and looking for a little bit of beer at the Holocaust Museum
0:38:48.560000 - 0:38:50.160000::Cafe, they don't card.
0:38:50.160000 - 0:38:54.880000::And you can have a little liquor and walk through the museum backwards because it's really
0:38:54.880000 - 0:38:58.600000::you can walk through that museum reverse chronologically where Hitler comes back to life.
0:38:58.600000 - 0:39:02.640000::Everybody puts their shoes back on hops off the train and it's all dandy.
0:39:02.640000 - 0:39:03.640000::Good God.
0:39:03.640000 - 0:39:06.560000::I've never.
0:39:06.560000 - 0:39:07.800000::I got a lot of DC hacks.
0:39:07.800000 - 0:39:12.440000::If anybody ever wants to know which roads to walk down, you should start a blog.
0:39:12.440000 - 0:39:13.440000::Oh, really?
0:39:13.840000 - 0:39:15.840000::Maybe a newspaper clipping.
0:39:15.840000 - 0:39:16.840000::Yeah.
0:39:16.840000 - 0:39:18.960000::Collection of food spots.
0:39:18.960000 - 0:39:22.560000::What does DC sound for?
0:39:22.560000 - 0:39:24.560000::The capital.
0:39:24.560000 - 0:39:27.560000::Oh my God.
0:39:27.560000 - 0:39:34.360000::I truly actually realize I don't know what DC sounds like.
0:39:34.360000 - 0:39:35.360000::It's amazing.
0:39:35.360000 - 0:39:36.600000::That's what it stands for now, man.
0:39:36.600000 - 0:39:37.600000::Are you serious?
0:39:37.600000 - 0:39:38.600000::Really good.
0:39:38.600000 - 0:39:39.600000::You're really washing in.
0:39:39.600000 - 0:39:40.600000::D.
0:39:40.600000 - 0:39:41.600000::Just think about it.
0:39:41.600000 - 0:39:44.040000::Yeah, you can get it washing.
0:39:44.040000 - 0:39:46.240000::So has no one ever said that before?
0:39:46.240000 - 0:39:50.240000::That feels like a perfect capital.
0:39:50.240000 - 0:39:52.240000::That is so good.
0:39:52.240000 - 0:39:53.240000::What is washing?

0:39:54.240000 - 0:39:58.440000::You know, just dig dig a little bit deeper.
0:39:58.440000 - 0:40:00::Yeah, it'll come to you.

0:40:00 - 0:40:04.480000::I don't want to feed into this narrative that we're idiots or that I'm an idiot, okay?
0:40:05 - 0:40:10.280000::Because I'm not I have smartness in different type of way. Oh, yeah. So
0:40:10.880000 - 0:40:16.120000::No, you have this is an important thing. No, don't Google it Eric. Don't fucking Google. Let me just jog my memory. Oh

0:40:19 - 0:40:25.880000::Bro, well, we gave up that's what's interesting to me is we gave up districts in 1910 by the statute of

0:51:34.360000 - 0:51:36.600000::whatever he's taking to get,
0:51:36.600000 - 0:51:38.280000::it's gonna catch up with his heart.
0:51:38.280000 - 0:51:39.720000::I have a theory that, you know what?
0:51:39.720000 - 0:51:42.400000::I feel like he should have gray hair at this point,
0:51:42.400000 - 0:51:44.200000::but he, you know what I'm saying?
0:51:44.200000 - 0:51:45.720000::He's got like two healthy.
0:51:45.720000 - 0:51:47.160000::He doesn't die as hair, I don't think.
0:51:47.160000 - 0:51:48.880000::But it's the Zin.
0:51:48.880000 - 0:51:49.920000::It's the Zin.
0:51:49.920000 - 0:51:51.160000::It's the Zin.
0:51:51.160000 - 0:51:55.040000::No, I feel like his, he's at an age.
0:51:55.040000 - 0:51:57.280000::Probably he's like, what, 50 at this point?
0:51:57.280000 - 0:51:58.120000::He seems like it.
0:51:58.120000 - 0:51:58.960000::54.
0:51:58.960000 - 0:52:00.480000::I feel like he should have gray hair.
0:52:00.480000 - 0:52:01.320000::Right.
0:52:01.320000 - 0:52:04.880000::But people who hang on to their natural hair color
0:52:04.880000 - 0:52:08.960000::for that long, I feel like that energy of grayness
0:52:08.960000 - 0:52:10.920000::is in the organs.
0:52:10.920000 - 0:52:12.120000::Is in the organs.
0:52:12.120000 - 0:52:14.320000::And it's rotting your interiors.
0:52:14.320000 - 0:52:16.360000::Whereas on the outside, you look like somebody
0:52:16.360000 - 0:52:18.560000::who has your full red hair,
0:52:18.560000 - 0:52:20.800000::that you had black hair, whatever.
0:52:20.800000 - 0:52:24.120000::But on the inside, that same gene that is supposed
0:52:24.120000 - 0:52:26.920000::to age you is attacking you from within.
0:52:26.920000 - 0:52:30.120000::So those are the people that die of heart attacks at 59,
0:52:30.120000 - 0:52:32.280000::at 62, you know what I'm saying?
0:52:32.280000 - 0:52:35.160000::So beware if you, of that youthful appearance,
0:52:35.160000 - 0:52:37.560000::because there's always some sort of ying and yang
0:52:37.560000 - 0:52:39.800000::that going on, that you can hold on.
0:52:39.800000 - 0:52:40.880000::Hold on.
0:52:40.880000 - 0:52:42.320000::Fuck boy.
0:52:42.320000 - 0:52:43.880000::Look at, don't call me that.
0:52:44.880000 - 0:52:45.880000::Do not call me that.
0:52:45.880000 - 0:52:46.760000::Hold on a second.
0:52:46.760000 - 0:52:47.840000::Fuck boy.
0:52:47.840000 - 0:52:50.880000::Look at Ringo.
0:52:50.880000 - 0:52:52.120000::Look at the star.
0:52:52.120000 - 0:52:53.120000::He dies that dude.
0:52:53.120000 - 0:52:54.680000::That is the worst one job.
0:52:54.680000 - 0:52:56.720000::That's the most obvious die on the planet.
0:52:56.720000 - 0:52:58.080000::It's causing him to do his scalps,
0:52:58.080000 - 0:53:00.040000::can you see it's like staining the scalp?
0:53:00.040000 - 0:53:01.040000::No, it's not.
0:53:01.040000 - 0:53:04.760000::He is a natural 83 year old with no grays.
0:53:04.760000 - 0:53:07.240000::He is the worst die.
0:53:07.240000 - 0:53:08.600000::And he has a beard too.
0:53:08.600000 - 0:53:10.880000::So he's dying the beard every day.
0:53:10.880000 - 0:53:13.960000::Like he has a team that's crazy.
0:53:13.960000 - 0:53:16.080000::He looks like, give it a look.
0:53:16.080000 - 0:53:19.400000::Basically, if Cap Jack Sparrow got in a bad,
0:53:19.400000 - 0:53:22.400000::at lighting on fire style car accident,
0:53:22.400000 - 0:53:24.680000::they try to re-read him,
0:53:24.680000 - 0:53:26.680000::but he couldn't grow everything quite the same.
0:53:26.680000 - 0:53:28.720000::I think I'm fire style accident.
0:53:28.720000 - 0:53:30.040000::Yeah.
0:53:30.040000 - 0:53:31.760000::He's cutie as a young go.
0:53:31.760000 - 0:53:33.040000::What?
0:53:33.040000 - 0:53:35.720000::I just, I got to stop.
0:53:35.720000 - 0:53:36.720000::Damn, so.
0:53:36.720000 - 0:53:38.160000::You can give Ringo a shot.
0:53:38.160000 - 0:53:40.720000::You think if Ringo goes up in the club,
0:53:40.720000 - 0:53:45.080000::he goes to the hottest club in New York City.
0:53:45.080000 - 0:53:48::Do you think there are something
0:53:48 - 0:53:50.040000::that you want to end up wanting?
0:53:50.040000 - 0:53:51.520000::Is he getting grinded on?
0:53:51.520000 - 0:53:52.520000::He's getting his face grinded.
0:53:52.520000 - 0:53:53.520000::Exactly.
0:53:53.520000 - 0:53:55.640000::Like, is he so famous that,
0:53:55.640000 - 0:53:57.920000::like, it doesn't even matter that he's like 82.
0:53:57.920000 - 0:53:59.240000::People want to like,
0:53:59.240000 - 0:54:01.400000::slob on his knob on that British.
0:54:01.400000 - 0:54:03.240000::On that British tight knob.
0:54:03.240000 - 0:54:06.280000::I want to slob on his head.
0:54:06.280000 - 0:54:08.960000::I think, yeah, he does look like,
0:54:08.960000 - 0:54:10.640000::I could fit his head in my mouth.
0:54:10.640000 - 0:54:14.840000::That would imagine, imagine what's going to be like.
0:54:14.840000 - 0:54:16.840000::I really feel like, yeah, let me get a dolphin
0:54:16.840000 - 0:54:18.200000::and then just put my whole head in there
0:54:18.200000 - 0:54:20.320000::in my first second to see what it feels like.
0:54:20.320000 - 0:54:22.440000::There's all these stories as of giants
0:54:22.440000 - 0:54:26::eating human beings whole hell.
0:54:26 - 0:54:27.600000::I just think the tension would be so.
0:54:27.600000 - 0:54:28.440000::What are you talking about?
0:54:28.440000 - 0:54:29.440000::What are you saying?
0:54:29.440000 - 0:54:31.920000::All these stories of giants eating people whole.
0:54:31.920000 - 0:54:33.440000::What, where are you talking about this?
0:54:33.440000 - 0:54:34.280000::A golem?
0:54:34.280000 - 0:54:35.280000::You talking about a golem?
0:54:35.280000 - 0:54:36.120000::You're not reading the same sort of,
0:54:36.120000 - 0:54:37.280000::all these stories.
0:54:37.280000 - 0:54:39.840000::You guys must not be reading the literature that I read.
0:54:39.840000 - 0:54:44.680000::It's mostly AI like fantasy novels about giants.
0:54:44.680000 - 0:54:47.440000::No one's reading the things that you're reading here.
0:54:47.440000 - 0:54:50.640000::Yeah, I don't know if you might be writing those as well.
0:54:50.640000 - 0:54:52.440000::I should be writing them.
0:54:52.440000 - 0:54:54.840000::Now I was watching a video yesterday,
0:54:54.840000 - 0:54:57.320000::October 14, 2023.
0:54:57.320000 - 0:55:00.040000::That was a bunch of dolphins eating fish.

0:55:00 - 0:55:03.520000::and they throw them in their mouths and it's a whole fish raw.
0:55:03.520000 - 0:55:04.520000::No live.
0:55:04.520000 - 0:55:07.720000::No, they just, they don't even chew on it.
0:55:07.720000 - 0:55:14.560000::It's just, you up, down the hatch, you know, and I'm thinking with all that bones in it,
0:55:14.560000 - 0:55:18.960000::how's that all right?
0:55:18.960000 - 0:55:23.920000::We can't even begin to contemplate how dolphins function.
0:55:23.920000 - 0:55:27.280000::This is something that if there's a scientific barrier here, the scientists have tried to
0:55:27.280000 - 0:55:29.800000::research them like this, such, but they can't.
0:55:29.800000 - 0:55:31.800000::Every time you open a dolphin, it like disintegrates.
0:55:31.800000 - 0:55:34.640000::It turns to dust.
0:55:34.640000 - 0:55:37.120000::What if they are the fucking wardens?
0:55:37.120000 - 0:55:38.120000::You know what I mean?
0:55:38.120000 - 0:55:40.480000::Oh, don't get me started on wardens.
0:55:40.480000 - 0:55:41.480000::Natural wardens.
0:55:41.480000 - 0:55:45.640000::My theory is that there's an animal species upon this planet that we think is a funny,
0:55:45.640000 - 0:55:51.040000::little cute little whatever turns out they're a warden from space to fucking run the
0:55:51.040000 - 0:55:52.040000::fucking nature preserve.
0:55:52.040000 - 0:55:54.360000::And you don't think that's what vegetables are?
0:55:54.360000 - 0:55:56.480000::He means like a guard of the prison.
0:55:56.480000 - 0:55:59.800000::Well, yeah, like a forest ranger.
0:55:59.800000 - 0:56:00.800000::You know what I mean?
0:56:00.800000 - 0:56:02.520000::You got the, okay, gotcha.
0:56:02.520000 - 0:56:06.480000::I think there are some forest ranger wardens, you know what I'm saying?
0:56:06.480000 - 0:56:07.480000::As an animal.
0:56:07.480000 - 0:56:11.520000::What are they, what are they, what a forest ranger warden?
0:56:11.520000 - 0:56:12.520000::First of all, what's that?
0:56:12.520000 - 0:56:13.520000::You mean a park ranger?
0:56:13.520000 - 0:56:14.520000::Straight up.
0:56:14.520000 - 0:56:17.800000::Because a warden, I only think of a warden as somebody who's evil.
0:56:17.800000 - 0:56:21.640000::You would think of a warden as someone who guards a prison, wouldn't you?
0:56:21.640000 - 0:56:23.280000::That's what that ward means, isn't it?
0:56:23.280000 - 0:56:26.680000::Well maybe you're more on the right track than I than you may even know.
0:56:26.680000 - 0:56:29.680000::Because we are a little angry.
0:56:29.680000 - 0:56:34.920000::Try to say that because you say what animal do you think is the most likely to be this
0:56:34.920000 - 0:56:38.400000::sort of alien warden of the planet?
0:56:38.400000 - 0:56:42.760000::What am I going to guess would be dogs.
0:56:42.760000 - 0:56:43.760000::They fucking come out.
0:56:43.760000 - 0:56:44.760000::Jack yours is vegetables.
0:56:44.760000 - 0:56:47.960000::You've already said yours specifically cucumbers.
0:56:47.960000 - 0:56:50.960000::Go ahead.
0:56:50.960000 - 0:56:56.040000::And they're getting slaughtered and fucking in rice bowls.
0:56:56.040000 - 0:57:00.080000::But they want to be that way because it's spreading the seeds.
0:57:00.080000 - 0:57:03.800000::I might get a sandwich for lunch.
0:57:03.800000 - 0:57:05.800000::All right.
0:57:05.800000 - 0:57:10.840000::Oh, can I pull up this idea just on the lateness thing just to bring it back?
0:57:10.840000 - 0:57:12.160000::Yeah, of course.
0:57:12.160000 - 0:57:13.160000::Yeah.
0:57:13.160000 - 0:57:18.280000::So Eric was 45 minutes late and actually 30 minutes because you guys had moved it for
0:57:18.280000 - 0:57:19.280000::a bagel.
0:57:19.280000 - 0:57:20.280000::Okay.
0:57:20.280000 - 0:57:21.920000::I would have done whatever it is.
0:57:21.920000 - 0:57:22.920000::Whatever.
0:57:22.920000 - 0:57:25.240000::If that makes you feel better and makes you feel better at night, then fine.
0:57:25.240000 - 0:57:26.240000::All right.
0:57:26.240000 - 0:57:27.240000::You were 30 minutes late.
0:57:27.240000 - 0:57:28.760000::That fucking 45.
0:57:28.760000 - 0:57:32.240000::Do you guys think that I know this is joy tactics?
0:57:32.240000 - 0:57:33.920000::I know we're all about spreading joy.
0:57:33.920000 - 0:57:40.960000::But I feel like we should have sort of a punishment system between the three of us.
0:57:40.960000 - 0:57:47.120000::I think there should be punishments involved for a variety of reasons.
0:57:47.120000 - 0:57:54.640000::If you're late to the podcast, you get punished either monetarily, physically, emotionally.
0:57:54.640000 - 0:57:57.640000::What are the maybe we should flood that out to the audience?
0:57:57.640000 - 0:57:59.320000::What kind of punishments would you like to see?
0:57:59.320000 - 0:58:01.920000::And we'll live stream them on Twitch or something like that.
0:58:01.920000 - 0:58:06.120000::And it'll be a whole set of like, yeah, it'll be a whole separate kind of thing.
0:58:06.120000 - 0:58:10::And we'll turn it into entertainment, which is what you got to do with everything these
0:58:10 - 0:58:11::days.
0:58:11 - 0:58:12.760000::Do you want to run the mile one time in eighth grade?
0:58:12.760000 - 0:58:13.960000::I flipped off my gym teacher.
0:58:13.960000 - 0:58:16.960000::He made me run the mile in the snow by myself.
0:58:16.960000 - 0:58:17.960000::Guess what?
0:58:17.960000 - 0:58:19.960000::You flipped him off and then he said you have to run the mile.
0:58:19.960000 - 0:58:22.520000::He sent me out there immediately out into the snow.
0:58:22.520000 - 0:58:27.320000::And he ran it and four minutes flat in the snow in the movie.
0:58:27.320000 - 0:58:28.320000::A national hero.
0:58:28.320000 - 0:58:32.880000::No, it took me like 20 minutes because I didn't run because I was being moody and it was
0:58:32.880000 - 0:58:35.760000::snow on the ground.
0:58:35.760000 - 0:58:40.840000::So there should be a punishment system that starts on a certain date upcoming.
0:58:40.840000 - 0:58:44.680000::And every crime that's happened before now, forgiven, fully forgiven, no problem.
0:58:44.680000 - 0:58:49.240000::Do you think a punishment system will keep you in line though?
0:58:49.240000 - 0:58:52.840000::Well, you think this will prevent you from?
0:58:52.840000 - 0:58:56.160000::No, it's shant.
0:58:56.160000 - 0:58:57.640000::So what do we have to do then?
0:58:57.640000 - 0:59:04.280000::If there is no punishments, there is no sort of jail system involved with radical forgiveness,
0:59:04.280000 - 0:59:06.720000::dude, bring it back to Jesus.

1:01:03.400000 - 1:01:07.400000::If you could imagine that fear, then we trace our steps back and went up the blue markers
1:01:07.400000 - 1:01:11.640000::and went up to a beautiful view at the top of this mountain and saw the sky.
1:01:11.640000 - 1:01:15.760000::We could see the sky on the New York beautiful sweating, beautiful, feeling amazing.
1:01:15.760000 - 1:01:21.160000::Then we come down and we went to a brewery and I'm drinking the beer and the most beautiful
1:01:21.160000 - 1:01:22.880000::place on earth.
1:01:22.880000 - 1:01:23.880000::And that was amazing.

1:01:29.560000 - 1:01:32.840000::But the thing that gave me the most joy, the thing that I want to communicate is the
1:01:32.840000 - 1:01:35.680000::name of a road that we passed.
1:01:35.680000 - 1:01:37.800000::You guys want to hear the name of this road?
1:01:37.800000 - 1:01:40.040000::More roads should be named like this.

1:02:07.760000 - 1:02:14.360000::Well, what gave me joy was I went to a concert this week and I don't see live music.

1:02:20.840000 - 1:02:28.480000::And I saw run the jewels, the rap duo of LP and killer Mike.
1:02:28.480000 - 1:02:34.520000::And they they're just they're just I kind of felt like they have a joy tactics vibe to

1:02:35.520000 - 1:02:40.760000::Honestly, as I was watching them because they're just having so much fun on stage, they
1:02:40.760000 - 1:02:43.080000::go into a song they body it.
1:02:43.080000 - 1:02:44.280000::There's no backing track.

1:02:56.800000 - 1:03:01.280000::The audience is just the audience by the way, I was kind of shocked at the people that
1:03:01.280000 - 1:03:02.280000::were there.
1:03:02.280000 - 1:03:10.280000::It's a lot of like I thought run the jewels was like kind of like a cooler audience would
1:03:10.280000 - 1:03:14.120000::be at the show.
1:03:14.120000 - 1:03:15.880000::And it was a man.

1:04:08.880000 - 1:04:13.280000::This is a piece of I want to call it cinema, but it was television.

1:04:44.040000 - 1:04:53.360000::You know, it was refreshing to see something as I've been saying, I feel like a lot of times.
1:04:53.360000 - 1:04:56.920000::Something that people in the filmmaking community have is some autonomy that I feel like as
1:04:56.920000 - 1:05:00.040000::comedians sometimes we are stuck.

1:05:00 - 1:05:08.320000::doing things often alone and often just with the intent of appeasing a gatekeeper so that we can
1:05:08.320000 - 1:05:13.440000::just try and make a living somehow some way. But I feel like seeing that project was a great example
1:05:13.440000 - 1:05:22.080000::of seeing how people who can people who are coming together to make something and they're doing
1:05:22.080000 - 1:05:27.840000::it for the right reasons, right? There they have a lot, seem to have quite a bit of autonomy and
