0:00:00 - 0:00:06::Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.
0:00:06 - 0:00:10::This is that old comedy bullshit that I just don't get down for.

0:00:35 - 0:00:41::But we also have, you're probably noticing that there's somebody else in the frame right now.
0:00:41 - 0:00:44::And yeah, you doubted us, you said we will never have another guest.
0:00:44 - 0:00:47::And yet again, we're proving you wrong.
0:00:47 - 0:00:51::You know them from Vice Live, you know them where they've got their dollars.
0:00:51 - 0:00:52::Don't say that.

0:00:56 - 0:01:01::We had to beg the production to pay her, but they didn't want to, but how much did you get?
0:01:01 - 0:01:02::20 dollars.
0:01:02 - 0:01:04::No, from Vice Live.

0:01:07 - 0:01:08::500 dollars!
0:01:08 - 0:01:12::But it was not worth it, because all the comments tell me to kill myself.
0:01:12 - 0:01:13::Oh God.
0:01:13 - 0:01:16::And look what's happened to Vice now.
0:01:16 - 0:01:19::Vice is finally, they're bankrupt, you know.
0:01:19 - 0:01:20::It's over.
0:01:20 - 0:01:21::It's over.
0:01:21 - 0:01:24::My live dream has been crushed to be a Vice Course Fund.
0:01:24 - 0:01:25::In Las Vegas.
0:01:25 - 0:01:27::Yeah, on the beat.

0:01:57 - 0:01:58::Wow.
0:01:58 - 0:02:01::The first week we were there, you had a show about September 11th and you kindly had us on.
0:02:01 - 0:02:02::You're joking.
0:02:02 - 0:02:03::I don't remember this.
0:02:03 - 0:02:04::It was at the vital joint.
0:02:04 - 0:02:05::The vital joint.

0:02:11 - 0:02:12::But they all had.
0:02:12 - 0:02:13::Seven celebrities.
0:02:13 - 0:02:14::That's right.
0:02:14 - 0:02:15::Seven very powerful people.
0:02:15 - 0:02:16::It's just saying, yeah.
0:02:16 - 0:02:17::It's just saying, yeah.
0:02:17 - 0:02:20::It's just saying, some people look like the monopoly man in real life.
0:02:20 - 0:02:21::Not just the monopoly man.
0:02:21 - 0:02:22::That's right.
0:02:22 - 0:02:23::It's him.
0:02:23 - 0:02:26::So what do you want to ask us about?
0:02:26 - 0:02:33::Well, what do you guys think would make me feel happy the way you guys feel?
0:02:33 - 0:02:35::Because that's what the whole podcast is.
0:02:35 - 0:02:36::Joy, yeah.
0:02:36 - 0:02:37::Well, yeah.
0:02:37 - 0:02:38::We need to bring in our people.
0:02:38 - 0:02:39::I need joy.
0:02:39 - 0:02:41::And we need to give some of that in Rachel.
0:02:41 - 0:02:42::Please.
0:02:42 - 0:02:43::And I like to notice your life.
0:02:43 - 0:02:45::And we can figure out strategies.
0:02:45 - 0:02:46::Spoke to you.
0:02:46 - 0:02:47::Yeah.
0:02:47 - 0:02:48::That will make you happy as hell.
0:02:48 - 0:02:49::Immediately.
0:02:49 - 0:02:50::I know this is something only.
0:02:50 - 0:02:52::You think that only psychiatrists can do this.
0:02:52 - 0:02:53::But we have.
0:02:53 - 0:02:56::We are licensed to prescribe medication.
0:02:56 - 0:02:57::Yeah.
0:02:57 - 0:02:58::We're life-ciatrists.
0:02:58 - 0:02:59::And our medication is an ounce.
0:02:59 - 0:03:00::Sorry.
0:03:00 - 0:03:01::No, it's in grams too.
0:03:01 - 0:03:02::Oh, yeah.
0:03:02 - 0:03:03::Oh, yeah.
0:03:03 - 0:03:04::Yeah.

0:03:11 - 0:03:12::Oh, yeah.
0:03:12 - 0:03:18.120000::So Rachel, what we do is, when we have guests on, we give them joy.
0:03:18.120000 - 0:03:22.280000::We study them intimately before they come on to figure out exactly what the topic should
0:03:22.280000 - 0:03:28.200000::be that we should go dive into that we think would be tailored to giving you joy afterwards
0:03:28.200000 - 0:03:29.200000::in a sense.
0:03:29.200000 - 0:03:34.200000::So the topic which we'd like to dive into today with you is called control.
0:03:34.200000 - 0:03:35.200000::Yes.
0:03:35.200000 - 0:03:42.200000::C-O-N-D-R-O-O-L-E.
0:03:42.200000 - 0:03:44.200000::I almost forgot the E.
0:03:44.200000 - 0:03:45.200000::For real.
0:03:45.200000 - 0:03:46.200000::Wait, is there an E in it?
0:03:46.200000 - 0:03:47.200000::No, no, are you serious?
0:03:47.200000 - 0:03:49.200000::You put an E in it.
0:03:49.200000 - 0:03:51.200000::You put a two in an E.
0:03:51.200000 - 0:03:52.200000::Control.
0:03:52.200000 - 0:03:53.200000::End with the L.
0:03:53.200000 - 0:03:56.200000::How are you working serious?
0:03:56.200000 - 0:03:57.200000::I got it.
0:03:57.200000 - 0:03:58.200000::Control.
0:03:58.200000 - 0:04:00.200000::Maybe in the French sense of the word.
0:04:00.200000 - 0:04:01.200000::Control.
0:04:01.200000 - 0:04:02.200000::Control.
0:04:02.200000 - 0:04:03.200000::Control.
0:04:03.200000 - 0:04:06.200000::What is your favorite thing to control in life, Rachel?
0:04:06.200000 - 0:04:07.200000::My life, my whole life.
0:04:07.200000 - 0:04:08.200000::I want everything.
0:04:08.200000 - 0:04:13::You have only one aspect you can control what pick it now or you lose all control of everything
0:04:13 - 0:04:14.800000::for every.
0:04:14.800000 - 0:04:18.920000::I would genuinely like to control my height a little bit more.
0:04:18.920000 - 0:04:19.920000::You mean go to what?
0:04:19.920000 - 0:04:20.920000::To what?
0:04:20.920000 - 0:04:21.920000::To what level?
0:04:21.920000 - 0:04:22.920000::I'd like to be higher.
0:04:22.920000 - 0:04:24.440000::And is that because of the WMBA?
0:04:24.440000 - 0:04:26.440000::Yep, that's exactly why.
0:04:26.440000 - 0:04:30.120000::Plus, I live alone now and I can't reach a damn thing.
0:04:30.120000 - 0:04:31.120000::What are you going to do about that?
0:04:31.120000 - 0:04:32.120000::I don't know.
0:04:32.120000 - 0:04:33.120000::I have stools everywhere.
0:04:33.120000 - 0:04:38.120000::Can we please get a go fund me to crack Rachel's tibia?
0:04:38.120000 - 0:04:39.120000::Yeah.

0:04:40.120000 - 0:04:41.120000::I would use you.
0:04:41.120000 - 0:04:42.120000::How much is that?
0:04:42.120000 - 0:04:43.120000::It's fun together.
0:04:43.120000 - 0:04:44.120000::Well, you got a turkey.
0:04:44.120000 - 0:04:45.120000::It's almost nothing.

0:04:46.120000 - 0:04:47.120000::I need the flight there.
0:04:47.120000 - 0:04:48.120000::Oh no, we'll think about it even more than that.
0:04:48.120000 - 0:04:49.120000::We're getting you the full surgery.
0:04:49.120000 - 0:04:50.120000::First class.
0:04:50.120000 - 0:04:51.120000::Everything.
0:04:51.120000 - 0:04:52.120000::Well, zero's the class.

0:04:53.120000 - 0:04:54.120000::We're going to put you in the pilot's seat.
0:04:54.120000 - 0:04:55.120000::Yeah.
0:04:55.120000 - 0:04:56.120000::Yeah.
0:04:56.120000 - 0:04:57.120000::A lot of people are doing this on the legs on the legs.
0:04:57.120000 - 0:04:58.120000::I'm going to put you in the pilot's seat.
0:04:58.120000 - 0:04:59.120000::I'm going to put you in the pilot's seat.
0:04:59.120000 - 0:05:00.120000::I'm going to put you in the pilot's seat.
0:05:00.120000 - 0:05:01.120000::I'm going to put you in the pilot's seat.
0:05:01.120000 - 0:05:02.120000::I'm going to put you in the pilot's seat.
0:05:02.120000 - 0:05:03.120000::I'm going to put you in the pilot's seat.
0:05:03.120000 - 0:05:04.120000::I'm going to put you in the pilot's seat.
0:05:04.120000 - 0:05:05.120000::I'm going to put you in the pilot's seat.
0:05:05.120000 - 0:05:06.120000::I'm going to put you in the pilot's seat.
0:05:06.120000 - 0:05:07.120000::I'm going to put you in the pilot's seat.
0:05:07.120000 - 0:05:08.120000::I'm going to put you in the pilot's seat.
0:05:08.120000 - 0:05:09.120000::I'm going to put you in the pilot's seat.
0:05:09.120000 - 0:05:10.120000::I'm going to put you in the pilot's seat.
0:05:10.120000 - 0:05:11.120000::I'm going to put you in the pilot's seat.
0:05:11.120000 - 0:05:12.120000::I'm going to put you in the pilot's seat.
0:05:12.120000 - 0:05:13.120000::I'm going to put you in the pilot's seat.
0:05:13.120000 - 0:05:14.120000::I'm going to put you in the pilot's seat.

0:05:00 - 0:05:01.640000::the femurs, the tibia, whatever.
0:05:01.640000 - 0:05:03.440000::I think we should do it from the neck.
0:05:03.440000 - 0:05:04.600000::I was gonna say it.
0:05:04.600000 - 0:05:07.080000::That's awesome.
0:05:07.080000 - 0:05:08.400000::Eric, you're crazy.
0:05:08.400000 - 0:05:10.840000::Yeah, well, I think we'll hold on a second.
0:05:10.840000 - 0:05:12.920000::I just found a flaw, designed wise.
0:05:12.920000 - 0:05:15.020000::Because if you put it from the neck,
0:05:15.020000 - 0:05:16.880000::the arms are gonna be just as short.
0:05:16.880000 - 0:05:18.240000::So, like, you gotta do it everywhere.
0:05:18.240000 - 0:05:19.240000::Yeah.
0:05:19.240000 - 0:05:21.360000::Can't you do it just everywhere, a little bit everywhere?
0:05:21.360000 - 0:05:22.400000::Of course you can, listen.
0:05:22.400000 - 0:05:25.280000::The body has over 512 bones in it.
0:05:25.280000 - 0:05:29.760000::Why is it, why are, these can't all be in use?
0:05:29.760000 - 0:05:32::Why can't you take slice the bone that's right here
0:05:32 - 0:05:32.840000::or not even using that shit?
0:05:32.840000 - 0:05:34.640000::Put that just right in this spinal column.
0:05:34.640000 - 0:05:35.480000::Oh, yeah.
0:05:35.480000 - 0:05:36.320000::It doesn't have a inch there.
0:05:36.320000 - 0:05:37.840000::Well, when you're a kid, you have way more bones
0:05:37.840000 - 0:05:38.680000::than you're supposed to.
0:05:38.680000 - 0:05:40.600000::So you should be able to just rearrange them
0:05:40.600000 - 0:05:41.560000::the way you want.
0:05:41.560000 - 0:05:42.560000::Right.
0:05:42.560000 - 0:05:43.720000::We have the tools to make our bodies
0:05:43.720000 - 0:05:46.200000::the way that we want them to, but you need to start young.
0:05:46.200000 - 0:05:48.880000::You need to have parents that are aware and give it down.
0:05:48.880000 - 0:05:49.720000::Yeah, exactly.
0:05:49.720000 - 0:05:54.240000::Otherwise, you're left at whatever 28 or 28, Rachel.
0:05:54.240000 - 0:05:55.080000::Yep.
0:05:55.080000 - 0:05:55.920000::Oh, yeah.
0:05:55.920000 - 0:05:57.920000::Oh, yeah.
0:05:57.920000 - 0:05:59.360000::With no hope.
0:05:59.360000 - 0:06:02.480000::So I mean, we'll get you there.
0:06:02.480000 - 0:06:04.760000::So you add of all things in life,
0:06:04.760000 - 0:06:06.640000::you wish you could control your height.
0:06:06.640000 - 0:06:10.040000::I just think that it would permeate all ass,
0:06:10.040000 - 0:06:13.240000::like people would take me more seriously when I'm working.
0:06:13.240000 - 0:06:15.680000::Maybe I'd be able to date a supermodel.
0:06:15.680000 - 0:06:18.320000::You have supermodels in the pipeline that I know about.
0:06:18.320000 - 0:06:18.840000::Yep.
0:06:18.840000 - 0:06:20.640000::Couple porn stars.
0:06:20.640000 - 0:06:21.480000::Can't fly back.
0:06:21.480000 - 0:06:21.800000::For real?
0:06:21.800000 - 0:06:22.720000::For real?
0:06:22.720000 - 0:06:23.480000::Yep.
0:06:23.480000 - 0:06:24.240000::Oh, yeah.
0:06:24.240000 - 0:06:24.880000::Yeah, so.
0:06:24.880000 - 0:06:28.960000::And then we're going to have to do the next two podcasts.
0:06:28.960000 - 0:06:29.960000::And no, yes.
0:06:29.960000 - 0:06:30.960000::Oh, yeah.
0:06:30.960000 - 0:06:31.960000::Oh, yeah.
0:06:31.960000 - 0:06:32.960000::Then we know.
0:06:32.960000 - 0:06:33.960000::Well, then we won't even remember doing it.
0:06:33.960000 - 0:06:34.960000::And we're like cringed it.
0:06:34.960000 - 0:06:35.960000::You guys are looking at the camera.
0:06:35.960000 - 0:06:36.960000::Doesn't matter.
0:06:36.960000 - 0:06:37.960000::I'm looking at the woods.
0:06:37.960000 - 0:06:40.360000::When I address the audience, I'm looking right in the camera
0:06:40.360000 - 0:06:43.480000::when I'm looking at you guys, my eyes are up in the towards the ceiling.
0:06:43.480000 - 0:06:45.880000::I'm looking three centimeters above the lens.
0:06:45.880000 - 0:06:48.200000::I've been looking up the whole time.
0:06:48.200000 - 0:06:48.880000::Yeah.
0:06:48.880000 - 0:06:51.680000::You have a problem controlling others.
0:06:51.680000 - 0:06:54.760000::I would like to control others badly.
0:06:54.760000 - 0:06:56.200000::I need I want to.
0:06:56.200000 - 0:06:58.680000::I want interns so badly.
0:06:58.680000 - 0:07:01.120000::I want interns to treat them badly.
0:07:01.120000 - 0:07:02.240000::You want to treat them poorly?
0:07:02.240000 - 0:07:02.760000::I'll do.
0:07:02.760000 - 0:07:03.280000::Yeah.
0:07:03.280000 - 0:07:05.040000::I want to them to.
0:07:05.040000 - 0:07:08.600000::But I'm going to be promising them a lot of opportunity
0:07:08.600000 - 0:07:10.400000::after they're done interning with me.
0:07:10.400000 - 0:07:12.560000::Oh, Nate Scott, Room in the van.
0:07:12.560000 - 0:07:15.280000::I have so many opportunities for interns out there.
0:07:15.280000 - 0:07:16.440000::What type?
0:07:16.440000 - 0:07:17.440000::What type of intern?
0:07:17.440000 - 0:07:19.560000::What type of opportunities will you give them?
0:07:19.560000 - 0:07:22.400000::Money, success, power, fame.
0:07:22.400000 - 0:07:26.520000::A network of like-minded individuals.
0:07:26.520000 - 0:07:28.720000::It's really endless.
0:07:28.720000 - 0:07:32.480000::But you just have to put in those four to 10 years
0:07:32.480000 - 0:07:35.320000::of just brutal, non-paid work.
0:07:35.320000 - 0:07:36.320000::Yeah, yeah.
0:07:36.320000 - 0:07:38.520000::I would do that.
0:07:38.520000 - 0:07:40.240000::Rachel, did you ever have an internship?
0:07:40.240000 - 0:07:41.240000::Of course.
0:07:41.240000 - 0:07:42.040000::Where's your internship?
0:07:42.040000 - 0:07:45.040000::I worked at a debate website.
0:07:45.040000 - 0:07:47.880000::Did you have a debate website or a cross-border?
0:07:47.880000 - 0:07:48.800000::Wait, what?
0:07:48.800000 - 0:07:50.720000::Was it a liberal debate website or was it?
0:07:50.720000 - 0:07:52.600000::Well, we have both sides, of course.
0:07:52.600000 - 0:07:54.840000::And my job was to research both sides.
0:07:54.840000 - 0:07:57.840000::And I would say in high school, I tended
0:07:57.840000 - 0:07:59.880000::to go for the conservative angle.
0:07:59.880000 - 0:08:02.520000::And then I would prove myself wrong once I did research.
0:08:02.520000 - 0:08:05.120000::You would steal man the argument, like the goat,
0:08:05.120000 - 0:08:08.320000::Lex Friedman, the most inspiring pocket.
0:08:08.320000 - 0:08:08.960000::Do you know who that is?
0:08:08.960000 - 0:08:10.560000::Yeah, then he interviewed Kanye.
0:08:10.560000 - 0:08:11.360000::Or he won?
0:08:11.360000 - 0:08:12.160000::He's the guy.
0:08:12.160000 - 0:08:13.680000::He interviewed Kanye West.
0:08:13.680000 - 0:08:15.640000::And he's a neurologist or what's his deal?
0:08:15.640000 - 0:08:18.480000::He's an engineer, descendant of Holocaust survivors,
0:08:18.480000 - 0:08:20.280000::Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Black Belt.
0:08:20.280000 - 0:08:20.800000::Really?
0:08:20.800000 - 0:08:22.120000::It sounds like you legit.
0:08:22.120000 - 0:08:22.920000::Not that.
0:08:22.920000 - 0:08:23.760000::Yes.
0:08:23.760000 - 0:08:25.320000::You know what, so funny?
0:08:25.320000 - 0:08:28.120000::How come every fucking Russian person on the planet,
0:08:28.120000 - 0:08:30.640000::you meet them and you find out you do the exact same thing?
0:08:30.640000 - 0:08:32.600000::The Jiu-Jitsu of it all is crazy.
0:08:32.600000 - 0:08:33.120000::It's weird.
0:08:33.120000 - 0:08:34.800000::Why are you guys all doing Jiu-Jitsu?
0:08:34.800000 - 0:08:35.800000::Board.
0:08:35.800000 - 0:08:37.080000::Totally.
0:08:37.080000 - 0:08:38.720000::I need to start doing that shit.
0:08:38.720000 - 0:08:39.840000::I think it's because we need it.
0:08:39.840000 - 0:08:41.560000::Because we have no natural abilities.
0:08:41.560000 - 0:08:42.680000::Oh, you know what grossed me out?
0:08:42.680000 - 0:08:45.760000::I was watching Mark Zuckerberg training
0:08:45.760000 - 0:08:47.440000::for his fight, maybe with Elon Musk.
0:08:47.440000 - 0:08:48.360000::Yeah.
0:08:48.360000 - 0:08:50.120000::And tell me if this is true, Jack.
0:08:50.120000 - 0:08:50.620000::OK.
0:08:50.620000 - 0:08:53.400000::There's something about fighting on those mats
0:08:53.400000 - 0:08:55::where people's feet, when they're fighting,
0:08:55 - 0:08:57.160000::get all yellow on the bottom.
0:08:57.160000 - 0:08:58.440000::Makes me sick.
0:08:58.440000 - 0:08:59.280000::Well, they come in yellow.
0:08:59.280000 - 0:09:01.200000::Take a look at the video, the foot's all yellow.
0:09:01.200000 - 0:09:03.840000::You can see it from the bottom going up.
0:09:03.840000 - 0:09:04.880000::It makes me sick.
0:09:04.880000 - 0:09:06.800000::There's nothing gross about it.
0:09:06.800000 - 0:09:08.720000::It's one of the least gross things in the world
0:09:08.720000 - 0:09:10.240000::to have a pop all our feet.
0:09:10.240000 - 0:09:10.400000::All our feet.
0:09:10.400000 - 0:09:11.920000::You're sweating in your eyes.
0:09:11.920000 - 0:09:14.160000::I have amazing feet by the way.
0:09:14.160000 - 0:09:15.600000::You have a tattoo of a bag.
0:09:15.600000 - 0:09:18.120000::My foot's all gangrene like in Mr. Deeds.
0:09:18.120000 - 0:09:19.120000::Yeah.
0:09:19.120000 - 0:09:20.120000::You're right.
0:09:20.120000 - 0:09:21.360000::What are all those lumps?
0:09:21.360000 - 0:09:22.800000::What is that lump right there?
0:09:22.800000 - 0:09:23.600000::I don't know.
0:09:23.600000 - 0:09:24.600000::Is that bad?
0:09:24.600000 - 0:09:26.400000::That is something that you need.
0:09:26.400000 - 0:09:27.400000::Oh, Nate.
0:09:27.400000 - 0:09:27.920000::That's a muscle.
0:09:27.920000 - 0:09:29.920000::It's full of liquid and look at that.
0:09:29.920000 - 0:09:32.760000::We could take it needle to that right now and take it out.
0:09:32.760000 - 0:09:33.960000::Is that green now?
0:09:33.960000 - 0:09:34.800000::Is that the Hulk?
0:09:34.800000 - 0:09:37.040000::No, the other one from Doug.
0:09:37.040000 - 0:09:38.040000::Oh.
0:09:38.040000 - 0:09:39.280000::Skeeter?
0:09:39.280000 - 0:09:40.040000::I know.
0:09:40.040000 - 0:09:40.560000::You're a fast guy.
0:09:40.560000 - 0:09:41.520000::Skeeter's head.
0:09:41.520000 - 0:09:42.680000::Dude, shut up.
0:09:42.680000 - 0:09:43.440000::Shut up.
0:09:43.440000 - 0:09:43.720000::What?
0:09:43.720000 - 0:09:44.280000::Yo.
0:09:44.280000 - 0:09:45.640000::All right.
0:09:45.640000 - 0:09:47.160000::So what's funny about the height thing
0:09:47.160000 - 0:09:51.280000::is Rachel though, because you think you want to be taller, right?
0:09:51.280000 - 0:09:52.880000::Because people take you more seriously than that.
0:09:52.880000 - 0:09:53.880000::Right.
0:09:53.880000 - 0:09:57.800000::But the problem is it comes with a lot of responsibility because you have to have the
0:09:57.800000 - 0:09:58.800000::answers.
0:09:58.800000 - 0:09:59.960000::Because people are looking to do somebody.

0:10:00 - 0:10:01.400000::falls on the ground at the park.
0:10:01.400000 - 0:10:04.280000::Somebody, whatever, you gotta save them.
0:10:04.280000 - 0:10:07.120000::Everybody assumes you are just fucking slow.
0:10:07.120000 - 0:10:08.480000::Let's give a real life example.
0:10:08.480000 - 0:10:10.840000::Last night we were at a club on Marketsville,
0:10:10.840000 - 0:10:12.280000::you're called Flavours.
0:10:12.280000 - 0:10:16.280000::And before that, we ate at maybe one of the most
0:10:16.280000 - 0:10:17.760000::busted restaurants of all, at all,
0:10:17.760000 - 0:10:19.640000::at all, at all time that made two of us throw up.
0:10:19.640000 - 0:10:20.480000::I'm out.
0:10:20.480000 - 0:10:21.320000::I'm out.
0:10:21.320000 - 0:10:22.160000::I'm out of the city.
0:10:22.160000 - 0:10:23.400000::Laila, okay.
0:10:23.400000 - 0:10:24.840000::Shark is in the name.
0:10:24.840000 - 0:10:25.680000::That's the whole name.
0:10:25.680000 - 0:10:27.600000::Laila threw up out the side of the car,
0:10:27.600000 - 0:10:29.400000::opened the door to vomit.
0:10:29.400000 - 0:10:31.640000::And Jack, you went to the bathroom too, throw up.
0:10:31.640000 - 0:10:32.480000::Can I say something?
0:10:32.480000 - 0:10:33.320000::I threw up in the club.
0:10:33.320000 - 0:10:37.040000::Not only did they throw up, they made themselves throw up.
0:10:37.040000 - 0:10:39::That's how bad they chose to throw up
0:10:39 - 0:10:41.720000::and then they were sitting with the food inside of them.
0:10:41.720000 - 0:10:42.720000::I like throwing up.
0:10:42.720000 - 0:10:43.560000::Well, you're just letting.
0:10:43.560000 - 0:10:44.880000::Can we describe Sharky's cantina
0:10:44.880000 - 0:10:46.480000::for a little bit and say what we got?
0:10:46.480000 - 0:10:47.320000::Of course.
0:10:47.320000 - 0:10:48.760000::I've never got a meal like that in my life
0:10:48.760000 - 0:10:50.720000::where the whole time I was like, this isn't good,
0:10:50.720000 - 0:10:51.800000::but what did you say?
0:10:51.800000 - 0:10:54.240000::It's not bad enough to be upset.
0:10:54.240000 - 0:10:56.680000::Well, I said it was the perfect amount of horrible
0:10:56.680000 - 0:10:58.440000::because it's like, it's bad enough
0:10:58.480000 - 0:11:00.920000::where it's like fun to like, isn't it so funny
0:11:00.920000 - 0:11:02.200000::how fucking bad this is?
0:11:02.200000 - 0:11:02.960000::Yeah.
0:11:02.960000 - 0:11:04.440000::But if it was a little bit better,
0:11:04.440000 - 0:11:05.560000::we would have been all pissed
0:11:05.560000 - 0:11:07.720000::because then it would have been like so bad.
0:11:07.720000 - 0:11:09.720000::Like, damn, I just ate a fucking bad meal.
0:11:09.720000 - 0:11:10.560000::Like it was so bad.
0:11:10.560000 - 0:11:11.880000::This was a bad thing.
0:11:11.880000 - 0:11:13.720000::It was almost like the room.
0:11:13.720000 - 0:11:16.960000::Like you know that movie, the room of meals.
0:11:16.960000 - 0:11:21.960000::So basically we ordered the trifecta, triple dip, chip dip.
0:11:22.320000 - 0:11:24.720000::And the chips came out basically more salted
0:11:24.720000 - 0:11:26.280000::than anything I've ever seen in my life.
0:11:26.280000 - 0:11:28.280000::They basically chipped the salt.
0:11:28.280000 - 0:11:31.560000::2,000% of your daily limit of sodium per person.
0:11:31.560000 - 0:11:32.400000::What was the dip?
0:11:32.400000 - 0:11:34.160000::And they were wet chips, by the way.
0:11:34.160000 - 0:11:34.680000::Wet chips.
0:11:34.680000 - 0:11:35.960000::And as can be.
0:11:35.960000 - 0:11:38.400000::Wet, paces also essentially like, right there.
0:11:38.400000 - 0:11:41.080000::Yeah, well Nate was going off about all the dips
0:11:41.080000 - 0:11:44.080000::in a way where I was like, I wanted the people
0:11:44.080000 - 0:11:45.440000::who worked there to hear it.
0:11:45.440000 - 0:11:46.840000::But I also didn't want them to hear
0:11:46.840000 - 0:11:48.160000::in case they made them feel bad.
0:11:48.160000 - 0:11:49.960000::But you were yelling a bit.
0:11:49.960000 - 0:11:53.400000::Well, it pissed me off because they said there was queso
0:11:53.400000 - 0:11:54.360000::in this mixture.
0:11:54.360000 - 0:11:55.440000::It was guacamole.
0:11:55.440000 - 0:11:58.080000::The worst guacamole at ever had a while in the eye
0:11:58.240000 - 0:11:58.920000::in my opinion.
0:11:58.920000 - 0:11:59.760000::It might have been bananas.
0:11:59.760000 - 0:12:00.760000::I don't think it was avocado.
0:12:00.760000 - 0:12:02.880000::This was a fruit that we don't know about
0:12:02.880000 - 0:12:06.440000::that they grow in caves in Syria.
0:12:06.440000 - 0:12:07.280000::Give it up for Syria.
0:12:07.280000 - 0:12:08.320000::The cheapest thing to grow.
0:12:08.320000 - 0:12:09.320000::It's not avocado.
0:12:09.320000 - 0:12:10.320000::Oh yeah.
0:12:10.320000 - 0:12:11.320000::Oh yeah.
0:12:13.320000 - 0:12:15.360000::And then what was the queso brother, Velvita?
0:12:15.360000 - 0:12:16.680000::The queso was the queso.
0:12:16.680000 - 0:12:18.800000::It was just fucking Velvita cheese.
0:12:18.800000 - 0:12:19.640000::I love it.
0:12:19.640000 - 0:12:22.120000::How dare they say that queso is amazing.
0:12:22.120000 - 0:12:24.640000::And Rachel and I both got chimichangas, mistake.
0:12:24.640000 - 0:12:27.680000::And we both, I wish for genetic.
0:12:27.680000 - 0:12:29.760000::I said, I held up my beans and rice.
0:12:29.760000 - 0:12:31.960000::And I said, it smells like poop kind of.
0:12:31.960000 - 0:12:33.200000::And Rachel overheard me in laugh.
0:12:33.200000 - 0:12:35.160000::And she thought, she said, I've thought the big neck.
0:12:35.160000 - 0:12:37.320000::I clocked in about 20 minutes earlier.
0:12:37.320000 - 0:12:39.200000::I thought it was a guy who walked past us.
0:12:39.200000 - 0:12:41.680000::But then I put my face a little closer to the plate
0:12:41.680000 - 0:12:44.240000::and I realized that's the beans.
0:12:44.240000 - 0:12:45.240000::It was delicious.
0:12:45.240000 - 0:12:47.560000::Here's the funny thing.
0:12:47.560000 - 0:12:50.720000::We kind of messed up by trying to get normal stuff, I think,
0:12:50.720000 - 0:12:51.920000::because there was something on the menu
0:12:51.920000 - 0:12:53.840000::that I didn't get that I really wanted to get
0:12:53.840000 - 0:12:55.240000::that I'll probably go back tonight and get
0:12:55.240000 - 0:12:56.440000::in you guys are sleeping.
0:12:56.440000 - 0:12:58::Called the Big Mac Adia.
0:12:58 - 0:13:04.760000::It was a queso deal with thousand island dressing, beef patty,
0:13:04.760000 - 0:13:08.760000::pickles, lettuce, beef patty crumbles, pickles, lettuce,
0:13:08.760000 - 0:13:10.480000::whatever was all on a Big Mac, American cheese,
0:13:10.480000 - 0:13:11.800000::jitter, whatever.
0:13:11.800000 - 0:13:13.680000::It has a queso deal.
0:13:13.680000 - 0:13:15.200000::And I think that might have been the best thing,
0:13:15.200000 - 0:13:18.280000::because we tried to get what, fish and chips, taco salad.
0:13:18.280000 - 0:13:19.280000::Yeah.
0:13:19.280000 - 0:13:23.280000::Yeah, you got to order the margarita that tasted like those things
0:13:23.320000 - 0:13:25.640000::and you squeeze as a kid that go all crazy in your hand
0:13:25.640000 - 0:13:27.240000::with their little floaties stuff in it.
0:13:27.240000 - 0:13:29.200000::I pulled the trigger because I saw a margarita
0:13:29.200000 - 0:13:30.200000::that had no description.
0:13:30.200000 - 0:13:32.080000::It just said it's an amazing jar.
0:13:32.080000 - 0:13:35.280000::It was $22, the most expensive thing on the menu.
0:13:35.280000 - 0:13:37.120000::Yes, I was like, this has to be amazing.
0:13:37.120000 - 0:13:39.880000::This has to be their Cadillac margarita, whatever.
0:13:39.880000 - 0:13:42.040000::And this guy comes over who doesn't speak English.
0:13:42.040000 - 0:13:44.800000::He's straight out of Russia, and he's been
0:13:44.800000 - 0:13:45.800000::a dirty margarita.
0:13:45.800000 - 0:13:48.320000::Margarita's the size of two gatorades.
0:13:48.320000 - 0:13:49.720000::And it looks like gatorade by the way.
0:13:49.720000 - 0:13:50.560000::It looks like blue all gatorade.
0:13:50.560000 - 0:13:51.720000::Then he takes a little shark.
0:13:51.720000 - 0:13:53.560000::He made a VPAs essentially.
0:13:53.560000 - 0:13:56.320000::He fills it with red stuff.
0:13:56.320000 - 0:13:57.720000::Dumps it in the margarita.
0:13:57.720000 - 0:13:59::Doesn't look at anybody.
0:13:59 - 0:14:00.640000::And then I go, oh, it's something fun's happening.
0:14:00.640000 - 0:14:02.400000::I go, oh, what's that?
0:14:02.400000 - 0:14:03.720000::Is this red stuff bleeding?
0:14:03.720000 - 0:14:05.200000::And he doesn't even look at me.
0:14:05.200000 - 0:14:06.680000::He's looking up in six different directions.
0:14:06.680000 - 0:14:08.080000::He goes, one is blood.
0:14:08.080000 - 0:14:09.080000::He said, this blood blood.
0:14:09.080000 - 0:14:10.320000::But he's all Russian, so that's a good point.
0:14:10.320000 - 0:14:11.320000::He's blood.
0:14:11.320000 - 0:14:12.160000::He's blood.
0:14:12.160000 - 0:14:16.880000::And then I took one sip and me and I got a headache off the bat.
0:14:16.880000 - 0:14:19.280000::Meanwhile, these people from fucking these Northeastern
0:14:19.280000 - 0:14:21.480000::owners, man, they suck.
0:14:21.480000 - 0:14:22::I don't know.
0:14:22 - 0:14:23.720000::They're talking about nothing but their screaming.
0:14:23.720000 - 0:14:24.240000::Screaming.
0:14:24.240000 - 0:14:25.240000::They weren't, yeah.
0:14:25.240000 - 0:14:27.680000::They're like, yeah, me too.
0:14:27.680000 - 0:14:28.680000::Yeah.
0:14:28.680000 - 0:14:29.440000::Whoa.
0:14:29.440000 - 0:14:31::Literally, they all got broken wrists.
0:14:31 - 0:14:31.520000::This was a distress.
0:14:31.520000 - 0:14:33.760000::Everybody's got a cast on every wrist.
0:14:33.760000 - 0:14:35.400000::This was a distressing meal.
0:14:35.400000 - 0:14:38.160000::And you were in deep distress afterwards.
0:14:38.160000 - 0:14:39.600000::I'd never seen you so full.
0:14:39.600000 - 0:14:40.760000::I was really full.
0:14:40.760000 - 0:14:42.560000::So we pull up to Flavas.
0:14:42.560000 - 0:14:46.040000::Jack's got his pop collar, Rachel, and that was a very nice
0:14:46.040000 - 0:14:47.240000::kind of pop collar.
0:14:47.240000 - 0:14:53.800000::I had a pop collar underneath a full XL Oxford shirt.
0:14:53.800000 - 0:14:55.400000::I was looking fly, man.
0:14:55.400000 - 0:14:56.240000::Yeah, it was.
0:14:56.240000 - 0:14:57.480000::Yeah.
0:14:57.480000 - 0:14:59.320000::And you had a backwards hat on at one point.
0:14:59.320000 - 0:15:00.320000::And I did.

0:15:00 - 0:15:01.780000::and I was putting it down on the dance floor
0:15:01.780000 - 0:15:03.940000::and Eric is violently injured right now
0:15:03.940000 - 0:15:05.540000::and he went, and I'm limping around on the dance floor.
0:15:05.540000 - 0:15:06.600000::I had a good time.
0:15:06.600000 - 0:15:08.480000::I was doing good until I slipped on some water
0:15:08.480000 - 0:15:11.880000::and my muscle automatically stabilized my body.
0:15:11.880000 - 0:15:12.880000::Are you slippery?
0:15:12.880000 - 0:15:14.540000::Are you gonna show them the video?
0:15:14.540000 - 0:15:15.380000::Yeah.
0:15:15.380000 - 0:15:17.080000::Oh yeah, the video I think will have come.
0:15:17.080000 - 0:15:17.920000::Oh no.
0:15:17.920000 - 0:15:19.420000::It's legit worth it.
0:15:19.420000 - 0:15:21.080000::Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
0:15:21.080000 - 0:15:22.480000::I'm not spoiling it, but something bad.
0:15:22.480000 - 0:15:24.280000::I'm not spoiling, I'm saying watch it.
0:15:24.280000 - 0:15:26.520000::Subscribe to Patreon, it's worth it.
0:15:26.520000 - 0:15:27.360000::Thanks for the food.
0:15:27.360000 - 0:15:28.440000::On Thursday, you will find out
0:15:28.520000 - 0:15:30.560000::what a horrible thing has happened to me.
0:15:30.560000 - 0:15:32.760000::By the way, some people call Thursday, Thursday.
0:15:32.760000 - 0:15:34.600000::But the reason I brought all this up,
0:15:34.600000 - 0:15:36.120000::the tall thing and the privilege.
0:15:36.120000 - 0:15:37.120000::Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
0:15:37.120000 - 0:15:38.120000::We're all dancing.
0:15:38.120000 - 0:15:38.960000::We're having a good time.
0:15:38.960000 - 0:15:40.120000::We're all some of the most attractive people
0:15:40.120000 - 0:15:41.600000::this island has ever seen.
0:15:41.600000 - 0:15:43.440000::Nate is getting it down to Michael Jackson
0:15:43.440000 - 0:15:46.200000::singing every word screaming it in the DJ's face.
0:15:46.200000 - 0:15:47.560000::The DJ's like holding his nose
0:15:47.560000 - 0:15:50.040000::because Nate's breast smells like Sharky's Cantina.
0:15:53.140000 - 0:15:54.960000::But guess what happens, y'all?
0:15:54.960000 - 0:15:57.800000::Jack has just thrown up.
0:15:57.800000 - 0:16:00.320000::And he's feeling a lot better.
0:16:00.320000 - 0:16:02.440000::I was chewing gum, my best friend
0:16:02.440000 - 0:16:03.840000::from one of five years old Chase.
0:16:03.840000 - 0:16:05.720000::And I was the talented cinematographer.
0:16:05.720000 - 0:16:08.400000::What do you all think happens next?
0:16:09.360000 - 0:16:10.840000::All right, well, okay.
0:16:11.960000 - 0:16:12.800000::Rachel, you want a drug?
0:16:12.800000 - 0:16:14::Okay, you can say, okay, you can do it.
0:16:14 - 0:16:15.400000::You know what, you're upset?
0:16:15.400000 - 0:16:16.240000::No, go ahead.
0:16:16.240000 - 0:16:17.080000::No, no, no, sir.
0:16:17.080000 - 0:16:19.760000::This girl is probably 15 years old.
0:16:19.760000 - 0:16:21.400000::I'm the only one to crack.
0:16:21.400000 - 0:16:22.840000::She's wearing all white.
0:16:22.840000 - 0:16:23.680000::Yeah.
0:16:23.680000 - 0:16:25.360000::She's like, oh, how old are you, right?
0:16:25.360000 - 0:16:27.560000::24, you're 24 years old.
0:16:27.560000 - 0:16:29.680000::Jack says nope, I'm 38.
0:16:29.680000 - 0:16:31.280000::How old you are?
0:16:31.280000 - 0:16:32.280000::You're 24.
0:16:32.280000 - 0:16:33.280000::Yeah.
0:16:33.280000 - 0:16:35.560000::She comes up to me and she goes like this.
0:16:35.560000 - 0:16:37.320000::You know Charlize that all?
0:16:37.320000 - 0:16:38.160000::Like, of course.
0:16:38.160000 - 0:16:39::No.
0:16:39 - 0:16:41.360000::She goes, that's my mother.
0:16:41.360000 - 0:16:43.320000::And my father is John Penn.
0:16:43.320000 - 0:16:45.400000::And I invite you to my private airplane.
0:16:45.400000 - 0:16:46.160000::No, it's not what I'm having.
0:16:46.160000 - 0:16:48.800000::Listen, she can't have to me and put the moves on me.
0:16:48.800000 - 0:16:49.640000::Big time.
0:16:49.640000 - 0:16:50.480000::She put the moves on me.
0:16:50.480000 - 0:16:52.440000::She said how old are you?
0:16:52.440000 - 0:16:54.680000::She had the legit game though.
0:16:54.680000 - 0:16:57::I don't know she had all the shit on her head.
0:16:57 - 0:17:01.280000::She had game in the sense that I was concerned for her.
0:17:01.280000 - 0:17:02.400000::No, you had game.
0:17:02.400000 - 0:17:03.280000::I have a Jack.
0:17:03.280000 - 0:17:06.560000::You were in the fucking corner of the club just doing
0:17:06.560000 - 0:17:08.400000::the two step with the corner.
0:17:08.400000 - 0:17:09.600000::With the corner.
0:17:09.600000 - 0:17:12.960000::Listen, they got your hands on the ceiling, moving your hips.
0:17:12.960000 - 0:17:16.440000::The ceilings are about eight inches above my head.
0:17:16.440000 - 0:17:19.440000::And so what I do is I put, this is my mating call,
0:17:19.440000 - 0:17:20.960000::even though I am taken.
0:17:20.960000 - 0:17:23.800000::I like to call people to mate with each other around me
0:17:23.800000 - 0:17:25.040000::like the sun.
0:17:25.040000 - 0:17:27.280000::So what I do is I put my hand up on the ceiling
0:17:27.280000 - 0:17:28.280000::and I just start wiggling.
0:17:28.280000 - 0:17:28.960000::Let everybody know.
0:17:28.960000 - 0:17:30.400000::Get it, get into it, get after it.
0:17:30.400000 - 0:17:31.240000::Don't be sorry.
0:17:31.240000 - 0:17:32.920000::You were grinding with yourself in the mirror
0:17:32.920000 - 0:17:34.400000::showing yourself your privates.
0:17:34.400000 - 0:17:35.240000::Of course I was.
0:17:35.240000 - 0:17:36.720000::I was getting the mood.
0:17:36.720000 - 0:17:39.880000::And I was grinding on your back and you didn't even see it.
0:17:39.880000 - 0:17:41.280000::I was distracted by the music.
0:17:41.280000 - 0:17:41.880000::All right.
0:17:41.880000 - 0:17:44.120000::But all in all to say, there's a bunch of attractive people
0:17:44.120000 - 0:17:46.800000::in a circle, but guess who gets chosen?
0:17:46.800000 - 0:17:47.680000::It's the tall one.
0:17:47.680000 - 0:17:50.400000::Even if he's a one inch taller, shorter than the other guy.
0:17:50.400000 - 0:17:52.520000::But her friend came for me as well.
0:17:52.520000 - 0:17:53.360000::Yeah.
0:17:53.360000 - 0:17:54.200000::And she was born.
0:17:54.200000 - 0:17:56.120000::And it was literally they were bullying me.
0:17:56.120000 - 0:17:56.600000::Yeah.
0:17:56.600000 - 0:17:57.960000::Because then they went to this, like,
0:17:57.960000 - 0:18:00.520000::there was an ancient man on the dance floor.
0:18:00.520000 - 0:18:00.720000::Yeah.
0:18:00.720000 - 0:18:05.160000::And they kind of went over to the old, the really, really,
0:18:05.160000 - 0:18:06.200000::elderly man.
0:18:06.200000 - 0:18:11.360000::And I don't know if he's like, he's kind enough on it.
0:18:11.360000 - 0:18:13.120000::He probably does that and plays dumb,
0:18:13.120000 - 0:18:15.280000::but he gets grounded upon it every single night.
0:18:15.280000 - 0:18:16.040000::He's probably.
0:18:16.040000 - 0:18:18.320000::Oh, I'm just out of the dialysis.
0:18:18.320000 - 0:18:20.720000::Now, Rachel, you love to dance.
0:18:20.720000 - 0:18:22.040000::I love to dance.
0:18:22.040000 - 0:18:23.040000::You were dancing.
0:18:23.040000 - 0:18:26.080000::I'm good at it at times.
0:18:26.080000 - 0:18:27::And I love it.
0:18:27 - 0:18:28.400000::What are your favorite beats to dance to?
0:18:28.400000 - 0:18:29.800000::This is important for the listeners to know
0:18:29.800000 - 0:18:30.800000::if they come up to you.
0:18:30.800000 - 0:18:32.680000::Fast Rihanna.
0:18:32.680000 - 0:18:34.520000::Oh, you mean like nightcore mixes?
0:18:34.520000 - 0:18:36.640000::Like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
0:18:36.640000 - 0:18:40.800000::What do you think about if Fenty sponsored all of us?
0:18:40.800000 - 0:18:43.080000::Do you think that people would like that?
0:18:43.080000 - 0:18:45.320000::LAUGHTER
0:18:45.320000 - 0:18:47.840000::Honestly.
0:18:47.840000 - 0:18:48.360000::Honestly.
0:18:48.360000 - 0:18:49.520000::Genuinely?
0:18:49.520000 - 0:18:50.320000::Yes.
0:18:50.320000 - 0:18:51::I do.
0:18:51 - 0:18:51.840000::I think so too.
0:18:51.840000 - 0:18:52.800000::Oh, yeah.
0:18:52.800000 - 0:18:55.320000::It's you would be promoting her brand.
0:18:55.320000 - 0:18:57::She's now a mother of two, I believe.
0:18:57 - 0:18:57.720000::That's what I'm hearing.
0:18:57.720000 - 0:18:58.720000::I heard that.
0:18:58.720000 - 0:18:59.560000::The male or a Fenty.
0:18:59.560000 - 0:19:00.400000::Give it up for two.
0:19:00.400000 - 0:19:03.880000::And she needs to be getting her money, et cetera.
0:19:03.880000 - 0:19:06.360000::Are her and Asa Baraki going to make it?
0:19:06.360000 - 0:19:07.360000::Defoe.
0:19:07.360000 - 0:19:08.360000::Defoe.
0:19:08.360000 - 0:19:09.360000::Defoe.
0:19:09.360000 - 0:19:10.360000::We just got our thumbnail.
0:19:10.360000 - 0:19:11.360000::We just got our thumbnail.
0:19:11.360000 - 0:19:13.440000::I was supposed to go on a cruise with her when I was 10.
0:19:13.440000 - 0:19:14.400000::Whoa.
0:19:14.400000 - 0:19:15.120000::What happened?
0:19:15.120000 - 0:19:15.880000::Was she busy?
0:19:15.880000 - 0:19:17.760000::She, no, I was busy.
0:19:17.760000 - 0:19:18.280000::Oh.
0:19:18.280000 - 0:19:20.800000::She was friends with my friends, brother.
0:19:20.800000 - 0:19:21.680000::They were on a cruise.
0:19:21.680000 - 0:19:22.680000::It was Rihanna.
0:19:22.680000 - 0:19:25.400000::My friend, her brother, and Penelope cruise.
0:19:25.400000 - 0:19:26.400000::What?
0:19:26.400000 - 0:19:28.400000::You want to go on a sailboat in the Caribbean?
0:19:28.400000 - 0:19:29.240000::I said, I can't.
0:19:29.240000 - 0:19:30.800000::I'm going to science camp.
0:19:30.800000 - 0:19:32.200000::Wait, what friend was, are you serious?
0:19:32.200000 - 0:19:33.240000::Yep.
0:19:33.240000 - 0:19:35.640000::My best friend in Alma just called Lily Gavin.
0:19:35.640000 - 0:19:36.560000::She's a model.
0:19:36.560000 - 0:19:37.320000::Look her up.
0:19:37.320000 - 0:19:38.400000::Rachel grew up in Willow.
0:19:38.400000 - 0:19:40::And Willow's in Rihanna.
0:19:40 - 0:19:40.520000::Yeah.
0:19:40.520000 - 0:19:41.360000::On a sailboat.
0:19:41.360000 - 0:19:43.760000::I never saw pictures though.
0:19:43.760000 - 0:19:45.400000::You grew up in New York City.
0:19:45.400000 - 0:19:49.920000::And you were exposed to a level of society
0:19:49.920000 - 0:19:51.600000::that people only dream of.
0:19:51.600000 - 0:19:52.360000::I know.
0:19:52.360000 - 0:19:55.120000::How many celebrity's children have you met?
0:19:55.120000 - 0:19:57.560000::Probably about 100,000.
0:19:57.560000 - 0:19:59.560000::Because we don't rock with the Netbo babies.
0:19:59.560000 - 0:20:01.360000::Unlead with the baby.

0:20:00 - 0:20:01.640000::We have about a rock with us.
0:20:01.640000 - 0:20:02.640000::We rock with us.
0:20:02.640000 - 0:20:03.480000::We rock with us.
0:20:03.480000 - 0:20:04.320000::I do.
0:20:04.320000 - 0:20:07.200000::But I'm not messing up my opportunity, man.
0:20:07.200000 - 0:20:09.120000::Oh, this whole world is nepot.
0:20:09.120000 - 0:20:09.960000::You know what I'm saying?
0:20:09.960000 - 0:20:10.480000::You can't work.
0:20:10.480000 - 0:20:12.920000::If you are going to be yelling at the nepot babies
0:20:12.920000 - 0:20:14.480000::and you live in an entertainment,
0:20:14.480000 - 0:20:15.640000::working an entertainment,
0:20:16.880000 - 0:20:17.720000::what are you talking about?
0:20:17.720000 - 0:20:19.200000::That's the whole fun of it, dude.
0:20:19.200000 - 0:20:20.040000::Chill.
0:20:20.040000 - 0:20:22.440000::Like when I get fucking all famous in rich and shit,
0:20:22.440000 - 0:20:24.520000::my kids are going to be,
0:20:24.520000 - 0:20:25.800000::they're not even going to know English.
0:20:25.800000 - 0:20:28.720000::They're just going to be these walking balls of entertainment.
0:20:29.560000 - 0:20:31.800000::There's just be like human parrots.
0:20:31.800000 - 0:20:34.680000::They're going to be like parroting lines from movies.
0:20:34.680000 - 0:20:36.360000::I can't spit that shit out.
0:20:36.360000 - 0:20:37.560000::That's from Tropic Thunder.
0:20:37.560000 - 0:20:38.560000::Uh-huh.
0:20:38.560000 - 0:20:39.920000::I've never seen it.
0:20:39.920000 - 0:20:41.840000::Well, you shouldn't see it because
0:20:42.960000 - 0:20:45.840000::the Academy Award didn't give Robert Donnie Jr.
0:20:45.840000 - 0:20:48.360000::the award that just nominated him for the award.
0:20:48.360000 - 0:20:49.360000::That's a good term.
0:20:49.360000 - 0:20:52.560000::We need to talk about Timothy Schallelman.
0:20:52.560000 - 0:20:53.720000::Oh, yeah.
0:20:53.720000 - 0:20:56.240000::He likes to score a phone.
0:20:56.240000 - 0:20:57.080000::Do you have the...
0:20:57.080000 - 0:20:58.200000::It's in the other room.
0:20:58.200000 - 0:21:00.360000::But let me explain it to you guys, basically.
0:21:00.360000 - 0:21:01.160000::And I'll show you later.
0:21:01.160000 - 0:21:02.920000::It's a picture of me and Timmy
0:21:02.920000 - 0:21:04.400000::and we're looking at each other.
0:21:04.400000 - 0:21:06.400000::And we look the same.
0:21:06.400000 - 0:21:07.960000::And then the back of my phone
0:21:07.960000 - 0:21:10.280000::is a picture of him on an airplane.
0:21:10.280000 - 0:21:11.120000::Wow.
0:21:11.120000 - 0:21:14::So what is it about Timothy Schallelman
0:21:14 - 0:21:18.400000::that you feel so energetically connected to this person?
0:21:18.400000 - 0:21:19.240000::I want to.
0:21:19.240000 - 0:21:19.800000::Because I feel it too.
0:21:19.800000 - 0:21:22.360000::I think when I see Timothy Schallelman,
0:21:22.360000 - 0:21:25.920000::I could really see you two fucking hitting it off of me.
0:21:25.920000 - 0:21:26.760000::I know.
0:21:27.160000 - 0:21:28.920000::Listen, Sierra Leigh, best friends.
0:21:28.920000 - 0:21:31.680000::Like you guys are roommates in a mansion.
0:21:31.680000 - 0:21:33.840000::But you have kind of like your own areas.
0:21:33.840000 - 0:21:35.160000::We have separate bathrooms,
0:21:35.160000 - 0:21:36.840000::but we choose to share one anyway.
0:21:36.840000 - 0:21:37.840000::Right, right.
0:21:37.840000 - 0:21:39.680000::Wow, double-synch, celebrity double-sync,
0:21:39.680000 - 0:21:40.880000::bump beds, awesome.
0:21:40.880000 - 0:21:43.280000::He, I know that he needs me.
0:21:43.280000 - 0:21:44.120000::Yeah.
0:21:44.120000 - 0:21:44.960000::He needs me.
0:21:44.960000 - 0:21:46.080000::Let me tell you what's going to happen.
0:21:46.080000 - 0:21:47.640000::The Wonka movie's going to come out.
0:21:47.640000 - 0:21:48.880000::Have you seen the trailer for this?
0:21:48.880000 - 0:21:49.720000::Yeah, we talking about it.
0:21:49.720000 - 0:21:50.720000::It's bust.
0:21:50.720000 - 0:21:51.720000::It's bust.
0:21:51.720000 - 0:21:53.920000::Yeah.
0:21:53.920000 - 0:21:55.680000::You're like a Josh Marock and Opalubla.
0:21:57.040000 - 0:21:58.040000::I literally.
0:21:58.040000 - 0:21:59.200000::Historically accurate Oompa Loompa.
0:21:59.200000 - 0:22:00.200000::This is what they look like.
0:22:00.200000 - 0:22:01.360000::It would have been more.
0:22:01.360000 - 0:22:03.560000::It would have been more appropriate if Hugh Grant
0:22:03.560000 - 0:22:04.640000::was not the Oompa Loompa.
0:22:04.640000 - 0:22:06::And it was me because they should only
0:22:06 - 0:22:08.600000::be casting people who could be Oompa Loompa's
0:22:08.600000 - 0:22:09.600000::to be Oompa Loompa.
0:22:09.600000 - 0:22:10.600000::Right.
0:22:10.600000 - 0:22:12.240000::Really tiny in the new floor.
0:22:12.240000 - 0:22:13.240000::That's how all the time.
0:22:13.240000 - 0:22:14.240000::That's it.
0:22:14.240000 - 0:22:15.680000::Yes, that's how they tried to get away with it.
0:22:15.680000 - 0:22:16.840000::How small, like a chicken nugget?
0:22:16.840000 - 0:22:18.040000::How small are we talking?
0:22:18.040000 - 0:22:19.040000::But they still cast it.
0:22:19.040000 - 0:22:20.640000::The size of the paperclip.
0:22:20.640000 - 0:22:21.440000::No, they did it.
0:22:21.440000 - 0:22:23.800000::They're not small.
0:22:23.800000 - 0:22:24.800000::They're not little people.
0:22:24.800000 - 0:22:26.160000::No, it's Hugh Grant.
0:22:26.200000 - 0:22:29::Hugh Grant is a fucking Hugh Grant.
0:22:29 - 0:22:30.320000::Is that Wolverine?
0:22:30.320000 - 0:22:32.560000::No, no, that's a fucking Hugh Grant.
0:22:32.560000 - 0:22:34.360000::Jack saw celebrity in the waves of the,
0:22:34.360000 - 0:22:35.720000::but he didn't recognize them.
0:22:35.720000 - 0:22:36.720000::I don't know who that was.
0:22:36.720000 - 0:22:37.560000::Wait till that.
0:22:37.560000 - 0:22:40.320000::I was just boogie boarding for no reason.
0:22:40.320000 - 0:22:43.600000::And somebody was floating out there a couple mid 40,
0:22:43.600000 - 0:22:45.320000::mid to late 40 year olds.
0:22:45.320000 - 0:22:48.120000::And this lady said, is your brown hair?
0:22:48.120000 - 0:22:48.960000::Okay.
0:22:48.960000 - 0:22:50.400000::And she said,
0:22:50.400000 - 0:22:53::Ugg, everybody here blah, blah, blah.
0:22:53 - 0:22:55::I like vacationing and Portugal
0:22:55 - 0:22:57.480000::because nobody recognizes me that.
0:22:57.480000 - 0:22:58.800000::Who that was, a penalty?
0:22:58.800000 - 0:22:59.800000::Who was it?
0:22:59.800000 - 0:23:00.800000::Brat shields.
0:23:00.800000 - 0:23:01.800000::Brat shields.
0:23:01.800000 - 0:23:02.800000::Mary's theme virgin.
0:23:02.800000 - 0:23:03.800000::Get a bin.
0:23:03.800000 - 0:23:04.800000::Oh shit.
0:23:04.800000 - 0:23:05.800000::So Rachel.
0:23:05.800000 - 0:23:06.800000::Yeah.
0:23:06.800000 - 0:23:08.120000::What did you think about the Wonka trailer?
0:23:08.120000 - 0:23:09.120000::Oh, it's so bad.
0:23:09.120000 - 0:23:10.120000::I lost it.
0:23:10.120000 - 0:23:12.760000::I knew it was the second day announced
0:23:12.760000 - 0:23:13.920000::that he was making a Wonka movie.
0:23:13.920000 - 0:23:15.920000::I was like, this is my chance.
0:23:15.920000 - 0:23:16.920000::This is the whole thing.
0:23:16.920000 - 0:23:17.640000::Because it's going to ruin his life.
0:23:17.640000 - 0:23:19.120000::He's going to go down.
0:23:19.120000 - 0:23:20.760000::You think one way we could do this?
0:23:20.760000 - 0:23:22.120000::Yeah, for a bit.
0:23:22.120000 - 0:23:23.480000::Especially because it comes out,
0:23:23.480000 - 0:23:25.200000::I think after doing, like,
0:23:25.200000 - 0:23:26.200000::doing's going to come out.
0:23:26.200000 - 0:23:28.360000::We stop with this crap.
0:23:28.360000 - 0:23:29.680000::I don't like blaming.
0:23:29.680000 - 0:23:31.560000::I don't listen to me.
0:23:31.560000 - 0:23:33.400000::I don't like blaming the actor.
0:23:33.400000 - 0:23:36.200000::Because an actor, they come and they make their choices,
0:23:36.200000 - 0:23:38.440000::but it is on the director.
0:23:38.440000 - 0:23:40::It is on the writing to,
0:23:40 - 0:23:42.080000::and it is on the casting director
0:23:42.080000 - 0:23:43.640000::to stop fucking with this man.
0:23:43.640000 - 0:23:45.640000::He will keep putting Timothy Shalome
0:23:45.640000 - 0:23:47.960000::into roles that he fucking is not good for.
0:23:47.960000 - 0:23:49.480000::What else do you think?
0:23:49.480000 - 0:23:50.320000::Don't look up.
0:23:50.320000 - 0:23:51.160000::Can I say this?
0:23:51.160000 - 0:23:52.520000::French connection.
0:23:52.520000 - 0:23:54.520000::Yeah, he wasn't that good.
0:23:54.520000 - 0:23:56.320000::They're just using him as this element
0:23:56.320000 - 0:23:58.400000::to bring into development so they can make money off the movie,
0:23:58.400000 - 0:23:59.760000::but they don't give them.
0:23:59.760000 - 0:24:01.360000::Timothy Shalome, we're teaming.
0:24:01.360000 - 0:24:02.200000::We're teaming.
0:24:02.200000 - 0:24:03.200000::He's playing Snowboarders.
0:24:03.200000 - 0:24:04.200000::He's playing Johnny Sunami.
0:24:04.200000 - 0:24:06::He needs to be playing the meanest fucking Snowboarder
0:24:06 - 0:24:07.360000::that we're ever in here.
0:24:07.360000 - 0:24:09::Yeah, Tim, but I changed.
0:24:09 - 0:24:11.720000::So has Timothy Shalome dipped his toe
0:24:11.720000 - 0:24:14.280000::into the realm of comedic acting?
0:24:14.280000 - 0:24:18.200000::A little tiny bit, but what I'm saying is,
0:24:18.200000 - 0:24:19.680000::he's going to go downhill,
0:24:19.680000 - 0:24:21.160000::and basically he's going to be like,
0:24:21.160000 - 0:24:22::you know what?
0:24:22 - 0:24:25.360000::I need like someone who can like basically check me,
0:24:25.360000 - 0:24:26.800000::like bring me back to reality.

0:24:32.160000 - 0:24:34.200000::I need to maybe take your wardrobe.
0:24:34.200000 - 0:24:39.520000::And then he's going to do all comedy type of stuff.
0:24:39.520000 - 0:24:41.440000::He's going to be like, fuck with all comedy.
0:24:41.440000 - 0:24:44.520000::Hey, by the way, I do not fuck with all comedy.
0:24:44.520000 - 0:24:46.880000::I am a club comedian through and through.
0:24:46.880000 - 0:24:49.280000::I'm sick of these fucking weirdos walking around

0:25:04.880000 - 0:25:10.440000::pointing out people's sexualities or leave it. I'll say this. The Joe Rogan cabal, and
0:25:10.440000 - 0:25:14.040000::I don't want to out you guys, but the Joe Rogan cabal, Bert Kreizer, I'm saying they
0:25:14.040000 - 0:25:19::are courting us all heavily. They all want us to join that circuit. I damn Tom Segura

0:25:48.960000 - 0:25:52.480000::Jews up in there. Instead of getting to put them in a train, they put them on the bang
0:25:52.480000 - 0:25:57.560000::bus, let them all suck. Oh, get off in the bus. But I'm on my back. You have to cut

0:31:19.240000 - 0:31:27.040000::Granted Village and so all the celebrity send their kids there and so I went there as a kid and so all of my peers are
0:31:27.040000 - 0:31:32.800000::Nepo babies and then I worked there after college and then all of my students parents are celebrities
0:31:33.040000 - 0:31:36::Can you clear David Bowie of any wrongdoing he may have done
0:31:36 - 0:31:41.560000::70s. Yeah, he was only nice to me. I tripped over him

0:31:45.040000 - 0:31:47.040000::My
0:31:47.040000 - 0:31:52.320000::So he's clear he's clean. He's at Monash and let me tell you this most chilling fact about David Bowie

0:32:06.840000 - 0:32:13.280000::Called black star. I listen to it. I feel like you were like his music manager for the last like two years of his life
0:32:13.280000 - 0:32:15.280000::I was sending him more emails than I could count
0:32:15.920000 - 0:32:19.440000::From the college radio station from the college read from a lot of aliases
0:32:19.560000 - 0:32:23.080000::But black and I wait I forget actually the power of the story
0:32:23.080000 - 0:32:29.320000::But it's it was about I did it come out after he died. Yes. Oh, God. Yes, and he like
0:32:32.480000 - 0:32:35.360000::Did he try to not die or was he like Steve Jobs?
0:32:35.360000 - 0:32:40.280000::I think he would use the medicine Steve Jobs did it was the end when you got such a good idea for a song
0:32:40.280000 - 0:32:46::You just like I was worth it. Wouldn't you've seen the world from his vantage point, which is from a basically King status
0:32:46.800000 - 0:32:49.960000::You don't want to live a half full life and by the way
0:32:50.520000 - 0:32:55.520000::F empty let me just tell you this what even though we just joked about Nate
0:32:55.520000 - 0:33:01.480000::Seeing you on the street and his thing being palming fans on the head the sad truth is that you'll never see neighborhood
0:33:01.760000 - 0:33:06.440000::Because he died seven years ago, and this is what he left his joy tactics podcasts
0:33:07.040000 - 0:33:13.800000::Yeah, we've been back and on the solve Nate actually has hair cancer and that's why it's been growing rapidly

0:33:37.560000 - 0:33:41.360000::Yeah, but a lot of people can't see the top of your head the way that they can see mine
0:33:41.360000 - 0:33:47.440000::So imagine if I was bald and as short as I was I'm saying you're okay. Well, that's that's doubling up
0:33:47.440000 - 0:33:49.440000::Yeah, just take a shot of liquor
