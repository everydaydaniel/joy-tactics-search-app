0:00:30 - 0:00:33::What is fundamentally good about nature?
0:00:33 - 0:00:35::Something whether something is natural or not?
0:00:35 - 0:00:36::You're breaking it down, okay.
0:00:36 - 0:00:39::Let me break it down because this is joy tactics after all.
0:00:39 - 0:00:40::Right.
0:00:40 - 0:00:45::Sometimes you've got to put the joy down and put the pencil up and do some studying.
0:00:45 - 0:00:50::Yeah, I'm just saying like, what else is natural?
0:00:50 - 0:00:53::Cancer, death, depression.
0:00:53 - 0:00:55::These things are natural. What's not natural?
0:00:55 - 0:00:58::Chemotherapy that doesn't exist in nature.
0:00:58 - 0:01:00::Like is that inherent or bad?
0:01:00 - 0:01:04::I want to like use, you know, the true nature of nature is evolution.
0:01:04 - 0:01:06::Go on, go on.
0:01:06 - 0:01:12::And so what I'm saying is Tom Cruise is very natural and because he is kind of one of the first to begin to evolve.
0:01:12 - 0:01:17::He is the mitochondrial eve of our people.
0:01:17 - 0:01:21::You know that when he was younger, he had all type of fucked up teeth.
0:01:22 - 0:01:27::And like if you go back and watch Top Gun, what else to see?
0:01:27 - 0:01:29::And using the outsiders.
0:01:29 - 0:01:30::Remember that?
0:01:30 - 0:01:31::For a book.
0:01:31 - 0:01:32::Mission Impossible.
0:01:32 - 0:01:33::Mission Impossible.
0:01:33 - 0:01:36::He's starting to, I thought thinking he started getting some plastic surgery then.
0:01:36 - 0:01:42::But in Top Gun in the 80s, he had a tooth like right in the middle of his face.
0:01:42 - 0:01:44::He got rid of that.
0:01:44 - 0:01:48::I think it moved over slightly because I've been trying to look at it in interviews.
0:01:48 - 0:01:50::It's back to normal.
0:01:50 - 0:01:53::It's no, no, I mean, it looks like, you know, I have no.
0:01:53 - 0:01:54::Yeah.
0:01:54 - 0:01:55::But then he got that.
0:01:55 - 0:01:56::Well, let's look at everybody.
0:01:56 - 0:01:58::But you know, I'm talking about that middle tooth.
0:01:58 - 0:01:59::It's just the centering.
0:01:59 - 0:02:01::Nobody's got perfect perfectly centered teeth.
0:02:01 - 0:02:02::Go ahead.
0:02:02 - 0:02:03::Let's see.
0:02:03 - 0:02:04::Eric, give us a big smile.
0:02:04 - 0:02:05::I should bust it up.
0:02:05 - 0:02:08::Yes, the Eric's is slightly to the right of your nose.
0:02:08 - 0:02:12::Nate, you, you know, actually kind of perfect.
0:02:12 - 0:02:14::And people like my smile.
0:02:14 - 0:02:19::You look like kind of like a British gangster right now.
0:02:19 - 0:02:24::The breath right strips on with the breed getting a gun to the head with the fucking breathe right strip.
0:02:24 - 0:02:26::Nate, you do that airflow coming in.
0:02:26 - 0:02:30::You look like like you know the animorphs.
0:02:30 - 0:02:34::How it's like animal on that it goes to human.
0:02:34 - 0:02:35::Right.
0:02:35 - 0:02:37::You look like in the middle point between.
0:02:37 - 0:02:43::No, no, you look like the last right before human, but like on the way in between human and like.
0:02:43 - 0:02:47::You look like in between of a human and like a mermaid right now.
0:02:48 - 0:02:52::Someone got my ass on a comment on a video from like eight months ago.
0:02:52 - 0:02:54::You need to stop looking at these comments.
0:02:54 - 0:02:55::I can't do that.
0:02:55 - 0:02:56::They're not good for you.
0:02:56 - 0:02:59::They are tearing you apart, man.
0:02:59 - 0:03:01::You need to shut off the comments.
0:03:01 - 0:03:02::You know, man.
0:03:02 - 0:03:03::Do you guys put this?
0:03:03 - 0:03:04::Wait, what did they say?
0:03:04 - 0:03:05::What did they say?
0:03:05 - 0:03:06::That's when you lose touch.
0:03:06 - 0:03:08::They said he looks like a capybara.
0:03:08 - 0:03:09::Oh.
0:03:09 - 0:03:10::Oh, let me go.
0:03:10 - 0:03:11::Let me go.

0:03:20 - 0:03:21::Ah!
0:03:21 - 0:03:22::Amit flunking.
0:03:22 - 0:03:23::I'm like a capybara.
0:03:23 - 0:03:25::Yeah, it got me.
0:03:25 - 0:03:26::Okay.
0:03:26 - 0:03:29::That hits you with the facial profile.
0:03:29 - 0:03:30::They got you.
0:03:30 - 0:03:32::They got you!
0:03:32 - 0:03:34::They really did get you on that.
0:03:34 - 0:03:35::That's crazy, man.
0:03:35 - 0:03:36::That's for now, though.
0:03:36 - 0:03:38::Wait, I was like, oh yeah.
0:03:38 - 0:03:39::I look like capybara is so what?
0:03:39 - 0:03:45.080000::So what I mean, I'm almost like yeah, I'd rather look like a capy bearer than
0:03:46.160000 - 0:03:48.160000::Crack then a piece of turtle whatever
0:03:50.400000 - 0:03:55.280000::And by the way not all capy bears look the same in some of them are important
0:03:55.280000 - 0:03:57.280000::There's one of the most cutest
0:03:58 - 0:04:01.920000::Animals people love these out of these creatures. So what do I mean?
0:04:01.920000 - 0:04:06.120000::Do I have a lot of space between my eyes and my nose because they look like they have a whole
0:04:06.800000 - 0:04:08.800000::foot between there
0:04:09.240000 - 0:04:14.760000::Eyes and no like you don't look like a capy bearer man. I think I kind of do because I knew I
0:04:15.400000 - 0:04:20.920000::Are you gonna be offended by this but you that that that checks out to me. It just does
0:04:20.920000 - 0:04:25::It could be where you're a man. You know, you're one of the best looking guys that I know
0:04:26.440000 - 0:04:30.480000::And thank you for that. You look like the sexy human version of a capy bearer
0:04:30.600000 - 0:04:35.540000::You know, like a people who really want to fuck a cap of bearer
0:04:36.060000 - 0:04:40.340000::You are like right I can't they can't even believe you exist. You know what I mean?
0:04:41.020000 - 0:04:44.180000::Well, yeah, I was not expecting that
0:04:45.660000 - 0:04:51.340000::Now what I know here's a video of a cat and a capy bearer being friends. Okay
0:04:52.740000 - 0:04:55.500000::I love videos like that. I do
0:04:55.500000 - 0:05:00.060000::shows like animals animals have feelings and they have

0:05:00 - 0:05:07.620000::have emotions, they have empathy, and I feel like we don't give animals, you know, that
0:05:07.620000 - 0:05:09.640000::emotional intelligence credit.
0:05:09.640000 - 0:05:10.640000::Yeah.
0:05:10.640000 - 0:05:16.640000::We just want to violate their world with our spaces, with our technology.
0:05:16.640000 - 0:05:19.400000::And we need to stop and we need to bring them into the fold, I think.
0:05:19.400000 - 0:05:26.300000::We need to bring them into our spaces, into our cities and have them be a part of this
0:05:26.300000 - 0:05:30.900000::new world that we're creating because I feel like they're getting left behind.
0:05:30.900000 - 0:05:31.900000::Yeah.
0:05:31.900000 - 0:05:33.400000::I know, I agree.
0:05:33.400000 - 0:05:41.160000::I think we're about two technological advancements away from being horrified by the way that we've
0:05:41.160000 - 0:05:43.020000::thought about animal intelligence.
0:05:43.020000 - 0:05:44.700000::I just think it's...
0:05:44.700000 - 0:05:47.020000::And before we move on, I just want to...
0:05:47.020000 - 0:05:51.380000::The Cappy Bear thing made me think of one of my most favorite moments online.
0:05:51.380000 - 0:05:52.380000::Have you guys seen this?
0:05:52.380000 - 0:05:55.700000::I think I've shown you Jack where it's...
0:05:55.700000 - 0:05:56.700000::What's his name?
0:05:56.700000 - 0:05:57.700000::DJ Academics.
0:05:57.700000 - 0:05:59.700000::You know I'm talking about...
0:05:59.700000 - 0:06:00.700000::You know this guy?
0:06:00.700000 - 0:06:01.700000::What?
0:06:01.700000 - 0:06:02.700000::I never...
0:06:02.700000 - 0:06:03.700000::I never...
0:06:03.700000 - 0:06:04.700000::DJ Academics is...
0:06:04.700000 - 0:06:05.700000::DJ...
0:06:05.700000 - 0:06:06.700000::It's like DJ...
0:06:06.700000 - 0:06:07.700000::He's like an interviewer.
0:06:07.700000 - 0:06:09.700000::He will clown on him.
0:06:09.700000 - 0:06:10.700000::Yes, they do.
0:06:10.700000 - 0:06:11.700000::Oh, yeah.
0:06:11.700000 - 0:06:12.700000::Yeah, yeah.
0:06:12.700000 - 0:06:13.700000::DJ Academics.
0:06:13.700000 - 0:06:14.700000::Okay.
0:06:14.700000 - 0:06:16.940000::And by the way, he looks nothing like me.
0:06:16.940000 - 0:06:17.940000::But...
0:06:17.940000 - 0:06:18.940000::Oh!
0:06:18.940000 - 0:06:19.940000::Hey, yo!
0:06:19.940000 - 0:06:20.940000::He was born in 1991.
0:06:20.940000 - 0:06:21.940000::Oh no.
0:06:21.980000 - 0:06:23.980000::He was like 50.
0:06:23.980000 - 0:06:24.980000::That is crazy.
0:06:24.980000 - 0:06:25.980000::That is kind of shocking.
0:06:25.980000 - 0:06:28.220000::Yeah, that's so young to be born in 1991.
0:06:28.220000 - 0:06:29.900000::Yeah, that's crazy as young.
0:06:29.900000 - 0:06:36.900000::Okay, but there's a moment on his show where he's interviewing Eric Abadou, my most favorite.
0:06:36.900000 - 0:06:43.300000::And she's sitting there and at the beginning of the interview, she pauses and she goes like,
0:06:43.300000 - 0:06:44.300000::you remind me of somebody.
0:06:44.300000 - 0:06:45.300000::I can't remember my name.
0:06:45.300000 - 0:06:46.300000::Oh, I've seen it.
0:06:46.300000 - 0:06:48.100000::And he's like, who is it?
0:06:48.100000 - 0:06:49.260000::And she takes so long.
0:06:49.260000 - 0:06:50.980000::She's thinking about it, thinking about it.
0:06:50.980000 - 0:06:51.980000::We'll put the link in the...
0:06:51.980000 - 0:06:56.580000::Well, then at the end of the interview, she goes, she thinks about it again.
0:06:56.580000 - 0:06:58.180000::She says, you remind me of somebody.
0:06:58.180000 - 0:07:02.500000::And she goes, like, you know who I finally remember who it is?
0:07:02.500000 - 0:07:06.780000::It's Tom from Tom and Jerry.
0:07:06.780000 - 0:07:09.860000::And oh no, Jerry from Tom and Jerry, the mouse.
0:07:09.860000 - 0:07:15.180000::And then they like, graft like Jerry's face on the DJ Academics.
0:07:15.180000 - 0:07:18.260000::And it's so lined up, so perfect.
0:07:18.260000 - 0:07:20.300000::They look exactly the same.
0:07:20.300000 - 0:07:21.300000::And it's funny.
0:07:21.300000 - 0:07:24.860000::I mean, when you can get someone like that, people want to hear me like describing YouTube
0:07:24.860000 - 0:07:26.260000::videos a little bit more.
0:07:26.260000 - 0:07:27.260000::Yeah, that was awesome.
0:07:27.260000 - 0:07:29.100000::That was on the feedback form.
0:07:29.100000 - 0:07:30.100000::I feel like.
0:07:30.100000 - 0:07:34.740000::Yeah, a lot of people said that they don't like going to YouTube anymore and they would
0:07:34.740000 - 0:07:35.740000::just rather...
0:07:35.740000 - 0:07:37.740000::You had like, you kind of just...
0:07:37.740000 - 0:07:38.740000::Especially...
0:07:38.740000 - 0:07:40.740000::Yeah, audio book version.
0:07:40.740000 - 0:07:41.740000::Right.
0:07:41.740000 - 0:07:42.740000::YouTube.
0:07:42.740000 - 0:07:48.980000::Well, some people are on a, you know, Fork Lift and they're listening to the podcast.
0:07:48.980000 - 0:07:56.980000::My friend Dennis, he moved to Kentucky and he's doing inventory at some auto parts place.
0:07:56.980000 - 0:07:58.500000::And he's just listening to podcasts all day.
0:07:58.500000 - 0:07:59.500000::He's on a Fork Lift.
0:07:59.500000 - 0:08:00.500000::God bless.
0:08:00.500000 - 0:08:04.420000::He can't be looking at YouTube while he's doing this.
0:08:04.420000 - 0:08:05.420000::Right.
0:08:05.420000 - 0:08:06.820000::He's going to describe the YouTube videos.
0:08:06.820000 - 0:08:07.820000::Right.
0:08:07.820000 - 0:08:09.420000::Or else he's going to drop all the bottles.
0:08:09.420000 - 0:08:10.420000::Yeah.
0:08:10.420000 - 0:08:11.420000::This is a blue...
0:08:11.420000 - 0:08:12.420000::Nope, that's not that that's blue color.
0:08:12.420000 - 0:08:16.340000::But this is a worker owned and worker first podcast.
0:08:16.340000 - 0:08:17.340000::Oh, shit.
0:08:17.340000 - 0:08:18.340000::Yes.
0:08:18.340000 - 0:08:19.980000::Cooperative podcast.
0:08:19.980000 - 0:08:20.980000::Correct.
0:08:20.980000 - 0:08:28.260000::We all cooperate with each other and with the government and pay our taxes very suitly.
0:08:28.260000 - 0:08:29.260000::And we're...
0:08:29.260000 - 0:08:34.300000::I mean, you bring this up Eric, but we are at a time right now where...
0:08:34.300000 - 0:08:37.140000::Jack, it was something going on.
0:08:37.140000 - 0:08:38.140000::No.
0:08:38.140000 - 0:08:39.140000::Okay.
0:08:39.140000 - 0:08:40.140000::No.
0:08:40.140000 - 0:08:41.140000::Okay.
0:08:41.140000 - 0:08:47.580000::Well, we're at a time in our society economically where we no longer have a need for
0:08:47.580000 - 0:08:54.300000::these CEOs, these rulers, these managers who are taking over and ruining our lives in
0:08:54.300000 - 0:08:58.940000::our day to day kind of lifestyles that we want.
0:08:58.940000 - 0:08:59.940000::Great.
0:08:59.940000 - 0:09:06.260000::And we are taking these people out that we're conventionally thought of as needed in business.
0:09:06.260000 - 0:09:07.620000::And we're saying no.
0:09:07.620000 - 0:09:08.620000::I do.
0:09:08.620000 - 0:09:09.620000::I do.
0:09:09.620000 - 0:09:12.740000::This needs to be the top...
0:09:12.740000 - 0:09:13.740000::Yeah.
0:09:13.740000 - 0:09:15.100000::The workers need to be owning this.
0:09:15.100000 - 0:09:18.900000::So before we go any further expand on this any further, I want to say like, yeah, top
0:09:18.900000 - 0:09:23.980000::level, see sweet executives, they got to go now.
0:09:23.980000 - 0:09:27.180000::That's all going to be decided by the workers for me right now.
0:09:27.180000 - 0:09:31.580000::But if you're a team lead or something like this or a manager of a small team, we still
0:09:31.580000 - 0:09:34.940000::need that leadership on the ground, on the tactical level on the ground.
0:09:34.940000 - 0:09:42.700000::And I think the middle management needs to stay for as long as the companies are around.
0:09:42.700000 - 0:09:45.660000::We need everyone to be like kind of level up to it.
0:09:45.660000 - 0:09:49.260000::We need workers to just all become managers, you know what I'm saying?
0:09:49.260000 - 0:09:50.260000::Right.
0:09:50.260000 - 0:09:54.380000::Well, that's because you know I'm a team lead in my day job, right?
0:09:54.380000 - 0:09:58.420000::And you're killing it and people love you and they've never seen somebody of your kind
0:09:58.420000 - 0:09:59.940000::of beloved by my team.

0:10:00 - 0:10:04.640000::I would love to have you as a manager.
0:10:04.640000 - 0:10:08.600000::It would be why because you think you can manipulate me or you think I do.
0:10:08.600000 - 0:10:13.380000::No, no, no, no, basically, you are kind of the manager of the podcast at all.
0:10:13.380000 - 0:10:20.720000::I'm unmanipulatable by anybody by any propaganda by any powerful person.
0:10:20.720000 - 0:10:23.720000::No, I do feel wrong.
0:10:23.720000 - 0:10:25.920000::I do feel like you are the manager.
0:10:25.920000 - 0:10:29.960000::Me and Nate are the employees of JoyTactics a little bit because you guys do
0:10:29.960000 - 0:10:31.760000::the editing and I sit back.
0:10:31.760000 - 0:10:32.760000::Mr. Ray Hill.
0:10:32.760000 - 0:10:37.880000::Mr. Ray Hill, if you like this clip, you like shut up.
0:10:37.880000 - 0:10:39.120000::I'm fucking sure.
0:10:39.120000 - 0:10:44.880000::But I remember this though, I'm in a matter of wedding and my friend's wedding in September
0:10:44.880000 - 0:10:46.720000::in Washington state.
0:10:46.720000 - 0:10:52.600000::And there's a beautiful stretch of highway up in it's near Bellingham, Washington.
0:10:52.600000 - 0:10:55.640000::Forget what the stretch is called, but it's right.
0:10:55.640000 - 0:10:58.360000::It's like the old orchard highway or something.
0:10:58.360000 - 0:11:02.080000::And it goes right along the Pacific Ocean's gorgeous.
0:11:02.080000 - 0:11:05.760000::There's old all these ancient trees stretching into the skies.
0:11:05.760000 - 0:11:09.160000::And I called you guys and what did I say on this call, do you remember?
0:11:09.160000 - 0:11:10.160000::I love how it looks.
0:11:10.160000 - 0:11:12.320000::I love how beautiful the journey was.
0:11:12.320000 - 0:11:13.320000::I said, well, yeah, it's beautiful.
0:11:13.320000 - 0:11:14.320000::It's an amazing time.
0:11:14.320000 - 0:11:17.440000::But I have an idea for us guys.
0:11:17.440000 - 0:11:18.440000::Go there.
0:11:18.440000 - 0:11:25.120000::No, no, I said we should start a pod cast.
0:11:25.120000 - 0:11:26.120000::Best day.
0:11:26.120000 - 0:11:27.360000::That was the best day of my life.
0:11:27.360000 - 0:11:32.360000::And now we're making literally $1,500 a month.
0:11:32.360000 - 0:11:33.680000::Oh, this one.
0:11:33.680000 - 0:11:37.480000::And because it was Eric's idea, that's awesome.
0:11:37.480000 - 0:11:44.040000::He gets, you know, leisure and luxuries that me and Nate didn't earn because we didn't
0:11:44.040000 - 0:11:45.040000::start it.
0:11:45.040000 - 0:11:50.240000::He made us kind of sign a contract and it was like, it was weird because we were like,
0:11:50.240000 - 0:11:53.160000::had been such great friends up until this point.
0:11:53.160000 - 0:11:57.040000::And he was like, once money got involved, it was like, I felt like I saw.
0:11:57.040000 - 0:12:00.040000::I don't play with a different person.
0:12:00.040000 - 0:12:05.240000::And it kind of, I mean, I don't know if I ever told you this in person, but it made me
0:12:05.240000 - 0:12:10.120000::like kind of hate you as a friend because it was just so tumultuous when we were trying
0:12:10.120000 - 0:12:11.120000::to get it going.
0:12:11.120000 - 0:12:18.040000::For months and months, we were just, you wanted like 90% of the earnings and I don't know.
0:12:18.040000 - 0:12:20.840000::We just kind of like gave up whatever man.
0:12:20.840000 - 0:12:22.680000::We don't want to ruin our friendship over this.
0:12:22.680000 - 0:12:24.080000::We don't have the money.
0:12:24.080000 - 0:12:27.440000::We don't really care about it, but apparently you do.
0:12:27.440000 - 0:12:28.440000::So I don't know.
0:12:28.440000 - 0:12:31.440000::That was fucked up and I'm sorry for bringing this up.
0:12:31.440000 - 0:12:32.440000::No, no.
0:12:32.440000 - 0:12:35.880000::On the podcast, we should have hashed this out.
0:12:35.880000 - 0:12:36.880000::Man to man.
0:12:36.880000 - 0:12:38.040000::I feel like people are interested in this though.
0:12:38.040000 - 0:12:41.320000::And I just want to say like there's a reason behind my madness.
0:12:41.320000 - 0:12:43.440000::There's a method to my madness.
0:12:43.440000 - 0:12:47.160000::And that method is I don't play with money like that.
0:12:47.160000 - 0:12:52.720000::And I don't usually mix friends and business except for when I see crazy potential for
0:12:52.720000 - 0:12:53.720000::millions.
0:12:53.720000 - 0:12:55.680000::I don't want to see dollar signs.
0:12:55.680000 - 0:12:58.040000::I break my rules a little bit.
0:12:58.040000 - 0:13:02.960000::Yeah, well, I wasn't mad about it because you got to ask yourself this question too.
0:13:02.960000 - 0:13:04.800000::Look at your best friend, everybody listening.
0:13:04.800000 - 0:13:09.240000::Look at your best friend and say, would you give them up, give up their heart and soul so
0:13:09.240000 - 0:13:12.640000::that they're just a shell of corpse, but you can still see them walking around and you
0:13:12.640000 - 0:13:14.680000::can talk to them and whatnot.
0:13:14.680000 - 0:13:19.280000::To have them be the best business partner you could ever have, would you basically give
0:13:19.280000 - 0:13:25.560000::up your friends, your family and convert them into money making machines?
0:13:25.560000 - 0:13:31.240000::Well, I think most people would say yes, of course, especially in this climate where
0:13:31.240000 - 0:13:35.120000::you can't know what recession is hiding around the corner or whatever.
0:13:35.120000 - 0:13:39.280000::We're entering a period of crazy economical instability.
0:13:39.280000 - 0:13:42.880000::So you got to make sacrifices where you must.
0:13:42.880000 - 0:13:43.880000::Yep.
0:13:43.880000 - 0:13:44.880000::And what do you get?
0:13:44.880000 - 0:13:48.920000::What kind of say you guys are best friend material a little bit for me?
0:13:48.920000 - 0:13:49.920000::Uh-huh.
0:13:49.920000 - 0:13:50.920000::Not even material.
0:13:50.920000 - 0:13:55.440000::I think you're already kind of there in my mind.
0:13:55.440000 - 0:13:58.720000::You don't, but yeah.
0:13:58.720000 - 0:14:02.720000::That's cool.
0:14:02.720000 - 0:14:11.480000::Okay, well, we'll chat about that later, but um, oh, we need to bring up this right now.
0:14:11.480000 - 0:14:13.080000::It's morning.
0:14:13.080000 - 0:14:15.600000::It's the morning time.
0:14:15.600000 - 0:14:22.820000::We usually record this, you know, evening, smoking up, smoking up, and then you put in the
0:14:22.820000 - 0:14:28.040000::hand cigarette, don't even know what you say after you're talking about those hot
0:14:28.040000 - 0:14:29.040000::things.
0:14:29.040000 - 0:14:35.440000::But it's morning time and I want to say this, I went to bed last night thinking I'm going
0:14:35.440000 - 0:14:36.920000::to be so out of it in the morning.
0:14:36.920000 - 0:14:40.360000::I'm going to wake up two minutes before the time we agreed to start recording.
0:14:40.360000 - 0:14:42::I'm going to hate it.
0:14:42 - 0:14:43::And guess what?
0:14:43 - 0:14:47.520000::I woke up an hour before I had my body woke me up naturally.
0:14:47.520000 - 0:14:49.520000::And what did I do?
0:14:49.520000 - 0:14:52.120000::Y'all, I took my dog for a walk.
0:14:52.120000 - 0:14:53.120000::Wow.
0:14:53.120000 - 0:14:54.120000::Made some coffee.
0:14:54.120000 - 0:14:55.120000::Wow.
0:14:55.120000 - 0:14:56.120000::Took a shower.
0:14:56.120000 - 0:14:59.400000::I came on here feeling fresh and fucking good and good to go.

0:15:00 - 0:15:03::That's incredible.
0:15:03 - 0:15:07::So, oh, and I want to share this moment really quick for my walk this morning, okay?
0:15:07 - 0:15:08::Yeah.
0:15:08 - 0:15:10::And I'm sorry to be hogging so much airtime.
0:15:10 - 0:15:11::No, it's okay.
0:15:11 - 0:15:14::But I'm walking my dog bubbles.
0:15:14 - 0:15:16::She's slightly psycho.
0:15:16 - 0:15:18::Psycho type of dog.
0:15:18 - 0:15:19::Love her ass.
0:15:19 - 0:15:22::You guys both have been there many times.
0:15:22 - 0:15:25::And I'm walking on my street.
0:15:25 - 0:15:27::And what am I wearing?
0:15:27 - 0:15:28::Can you see?
0:15:28 - 0:15:29::Yeah.
0:15:29 - 0:15:30::Yeah.
0:15:30 - 0:15:32::Oh, PJ, pajama pants.
0:15:32 - 0:15:35::They are Christmas.
0:15:35 - 0:15:37::Life is good.
0:15:37 - 0:15:38::Sweats.
0:15:38 - 0:15:41::You're going to get killed in those.
0:15:41 - 0:15:43::I just want to say this.
0:15:43 - 0:15:45::My mom got these for me for Christmas.
0:15:45 - 0:15:48::I would not usually gravitate towards this type of flannel.
0:15:48 - 0:15:52::You know, it feels like plastic.
0:15:52 - 0:15:53::Whatever.
0:15:53 - 0:15:55::It makes you sweat kind of in a bad way.
0:15:55 - 0:15:57::That's like ruining your sperm.
0:15:57 - 0:16:00::You're going to die in the morning.
0:16:00 - 0:16:04::Someone's going to chop your fucking head off in those fucking pants.
0:16:04 - 0:16:06::Listen to this.
0:16:06 - 0:16:08::I'm walking down the street.
0:16:08 - 0:16:09::Okay.
0:16:09 - 0:16:10::I mean, my puffer coat.
0:16:10 - 0:16:12::I got my new headphones on.
0:16:12 - 0:16:15::By the way, new headphones because I left my bows in an Uber.
0:16:15 - 0:16:17::And I got new Sony headphones are amazing.
0:16:17 - 0:16:18::And I'm crouching down.
0:16:18 - 0:16:20::And my dog has diarrhea.
0:16:20 - 0:16:21::Okay.
0:16:21 - 0:16:22::Bubbles has diarrhea this morning.
0:16:22 - 0:16:23::And I'm cleaning it.
0:16:23 - 0:16:26::I'm like literally trying to mop it up on the sidewalk.
0:16:26 - 0:16:32::It looked, if I was my 18 year old person myself and I saw me from across the street,
0:16:32 - 0:16:34::I would be so upset.
0:16:34 - 0:16:37::And I would think what a loser is that?
0:16:37 - 0:16:39::Wearing life is good.
0:16:39 - 0:16:44::Pajamas cleaning up his dog's diarrhea who's doing circles out of excitement because she sees a bird.
0:16:44 - 0:16:47::He looks at, he must be so sad.
0:16:47 - 0:16:48::Well, guess what?
0:16:48 - 0:16:50::I wasn't sad.
0:16:50 - 0:16:52::I was sitting there listening to my music.
0:16:52 - 0:16:54::My new sort of instrumental jazz.
0:16:54 - 0:16:55::I was cleaning up the dog poop.
0:16:55 - 0:16:57::And I'm happier than I've ever been.
0:16:57 - 0:17:02::I swear to God, even wearing all this shit and looking like that.
0:17:02 - 0:17:03::I felt so good.
0:17:03 - 0:17:10::And all that to say, you know, maturity and growing older is not what you think it is when you're young.
0:17:10 - 0:17:11::You know what I mean?
0:17:11 - 0:17:12::No.
0:17:12 - 0:17:14::Happiness is not what you plan for yourself.
0:17:14 - 0:17:18::It's not the pools and the mansions that you plan for yourself at 17.
0:17:18 - 0:17:21::Happiness is actually cleaning up your dog's diarrhea.
0:17:21 - 0:17:23::There's probably a lot of 17 year olds.
0:17:23 - 0:17:24::You know what I mean?
0:17:24 - 0:17:27::We got a lot of 17 year olds who are tuned in, of course.
0:17:27 - 0:17:28::Oh, how about guidance?
0:17:28 - 0:17:33::And we want to encourage you to go for it, to make that money and get that pool with the car
0:17:33 - 0:17:34::and whatever.
0:17:34 - 0:17:35::Right.
0:17:35 - 0:17:43::And then you want to, but just know that if that doesn't pan out, there are pools in life that
0:17:43 - 0:17:44::are pools.
0:17:44 - 0:17:48::Your dog, your relationship with your dog, that's a pool.
0:17:48 - 0:17:52::Your relationship with food that you eat, that's a car.
0:17:52 - 0:17:54::You know, so it'll change.
0:17:54 - 0:17:55::You'll settle.
0:17:55 - 0:18:04::You know, I think we should do is give advice to people that are in their early 20s, because
0:18:04 - 0:18:10::we are three men that have gone through their 20s the full decade.
0:18:10 - 0:18:11::Right.
0:18:11 - 0:18:14::And we have learned a lot of lessons.
0:18:14 - 0:18:15::Right.
0:18:15 - 0:18:21::And I think that we have, I think that we have.
0:18:21 - 0:18:27::You know, went through so many challenges that we can give kind of crazy ass advice to a lot
0:18:27 - 0:18:33::of the 20 year old or, you know, people, even if you're at 29, you can still, I think, use some of this advice.
0:18:33 - 0:18:41::And it's about guys say to, like, people in their 20s right now of how they should be living their life.
0:18:41 - 0:18:44::You know, how should they be building that foundation?
0:18:44 - 0:18:45::I'll say this.
0:18:45 - 0:18:50::Hit rock bottom as soon as you fucking can, because you're going to hit it at some point.
0:18:50 - 0:18:58::Kind of course correct to hit make yourself go to rock bottom as early in your 20s as you can, because once you hit that.
0:18:58 - 0:19:02::And I mean, because you'll think you'll have hit your bottom, right.
0:19:02 - 0:19:04::But then guess what?
0:19:04 - 0:19:08::There's about 20 floors deeper into hell that you can go there.
0:19:08 - 0:19:10::Burn your bridges with your family.
0:19:10 - 0:19:12::Don't get invited to Thanksgiving.
0:19:12 - 0:19:17::Be all, give yourself diseases that end up out like rashes all over your skin.
0:19:17 - 0:19:22::Go to a very bad place and then crawl your way back up to the surface.
0:19:22 - 0:19:25::Because once you get to the surface, it's going to be a lot nicer.
0:19:25 - 0:19:26::You know what I'm saying?
0:19:26 - 0:19:29::And you won't have to go to the bottom again.
0:19:29 - 0:19:36::Why is the, why is the surface nicer when because guess what they were going for a while and the surface they thought before.
0:19:36 - 0:19:39::Oh, it's so it's a sepia tone, boring existence.
0:19:39 - 0:19:40::I live in suburbia.
0:19:40 - 0:19:43::I want to fucking get out of here and do this that.
0:19:43 - 0:19:45::Then they go to hell, right.
0:19:45 - 0:19:49::They burn their bridges to get addicted to alcohol, whatever.
0:19:49 - 0:19:55::When they finally crawl back up to that surface that they thought was so fucking boring and not worth their time, they'll find that.
0:19:55 - 0:19:59::The surface is all multi colored.
0:19:59 - 0:20:00::It's.

0:20:00 - 0:20:06.320000::Technicolor now it's gorgeous. It's beautiful. All these grocery stores that they thought were pathetic are now
0:20:07.080000 - 0:20:11::Modern marbles of logistics and this is this is how I felt
0:20:12.080000 - 0:20:18.400000::My sophomore year high school when they sent me away to a remedial school for a couple months when I got back to public school
0:20:19.640000 - 0:20:21.640000::When I got back to public school man
0:20:21.640000 - 0:20:23.840000::I didn't look at these lessons about
0:20:24.320000 - 0:20:30.280000::Millard film or the way that I did before the hand. I didn't look at the way they talked about physics is boring. I was thinking
0:20:30.920000 - 0:20:34.120000::We're gonna drop a egg. This is so sick
0:20:34.720000 - 0:20:39.560000::Emmett, you know all these equations. They're like just letting me know these equations for free dangerous
0:20:39.800000 - 0:20:44.160000::Very dangerous that they would just tell me all this shit. Did your eggs survive the drop?
0:20:45.840000 - 0:20:51.160000::Nah, and that was food by the way. That's what it was the hardest thing for me about watching that was like
0:20:51.560000 - 0:20:57.240000::We're being so wasteful. I have a 20 second story about my egg drop
0:20:57.240000 - 0:21:00.240000::I was 18 I
0:21:01.320000 - 0:21:06.600000::Was sick a lot my sixth grade year of school I had chicken box and I had pneumonia then I had something else and I
0:21:06.840000 - 0:21:12.680000::Everybody thought I was dying like the teachers like I think told the students like he's got it bad
0:21:12.680000 - 0:21:14.680000::Because I just kept getting sick over and over again
0:21:14.680000 - 0:21:20.280000::And so but I came back for one single day to do the egg drop and I had been like
0:21:20.760000 - 0:21:26.320000::In bed for two weeks like I don't know how I got so sick and I come back like all sweaty like you are your first day
0:21:26.320000 - 0:21:29.880000::Like out of bed, you know what I mean? Yeah, and I came just for the egg drop put
0:21:31 - 0:21:35.440000::Put my egg in a box with a bunch of foam. It's my egg in a box. Oh
0:21:36.760000 - 0:21:43.680000::My god, I got to the top of the ladder drop my drop my shoe box and guess what the egg broke and guess what I did

0:24:30.960000 - 0:24:35.760000::You wouldn't expect it just because you don't think Eric has a lot of friends, but people are coming out of

0:25:19.040000 - 0:25:23.920000::No, you're joking, you're joking. Let me do it for real. This is how people really feel about you.
0:25:23.920000 - 0:25:25.920000::It's here.
0:25:29.920000 - 0:25:31.920000::Sorry to have let me start over.
0:25:33.920000 - 0:25:44.920000::I just want to start out by saying I love everybody here and it's a testament to how good a person Eric was to see a room so full of so many people who love each other.
0:25:44.920000 - 0:25:50.920000::It's so amazing. I'm just excited. I'm delighted to just be around everybody and celebrate the life of Eric.
0:25:50.920000 - 0:25:56.920000::And if there's one thing that's true, it's that about Eric. It's that he looked like a cap of error.
0:25:58.920000 - 0:26:00.920000::Everyone's cracking up. It's like a call up.
0:26:02.920000 - 0:26:04.920000::It was just like falling out of their seats.
0:26:04.920000 - 0:26:08.920000::Happy bearer looking at speech. We're supposed to have a hug in your car.
0:26:08.920000 - 0:26:10.920000::You're on the car.
0:26:10.920000 - 0:26:12.920000::Yeah.
0:26:12.920000 - 0:26:14.920000::So it's laughing you around like fucking Jimny cricket.
0:26:14.920000 - 0:26:18.920000::As long as enough kind of famous people were there, I'd be okay.
0:26:18.920000 - 0:26:24.920000::But if this is all my loser friends from home and Chicago, forget it. I don't want to invite people to the funeral.
0:26:24.920000 - 0:26:32.920000::I do because I'm doing that. Listen, I'm getting all my arrangements. I have, I had a wheel ready to go at 17 and I updated it frequently.
0:26:34.920000 - 0:26:40.920000::But oh, I do want to say this. I want to reveal something that is real. I'm not this isn't the joke.
0:26:40.920000 - 0:26:46.920000::Jack, for some reason, there's a song by Nick Drake. Do you guys know who Nick Drake is?
0:26:46.920000 - 0:26:48.920000::Is that like a Dracula type of dude?
0:26:48.920000 - 0:26:52.920000::He was like this British sort of folk singer from the city.
0:26:52.920000 - 0:26:58.920000::Oh, I know what you're talking about. He died young and killed himself.
0:26:58.920000 - 0:27:00.920000::Very sad.
0:27:00.920000 - 0:27:04.920000::But there's a song called Place to Be.
0:27:04.920000 - 0:27:10.920000::And for some reason, Jack, I heard that song maybe eight months ago.
0:27:10.920000 - 0:27:16.920000::I've listened, I heard it for years, but came on again and I imagined you being dead.
0:27:16.920000 - 0:27:24.920000::And it's your funeral. And I would have learned this song on guitar and sing it at the funeral.
0:27:24.920000 - 0:27:38.920000::For some reason, I imagined myself doing this and I got, it was almost like indulgent making myself feel sad and then making my felt self feel how like congratulatory everybody was about how good my singing was at your funeral.
0:27:38.920000 - 0:27:46.920000::I legit have played this. And every time I hear that song now, I go right to your funeral and right to me sitting on a stool with an acoustic guitar singing the song.
0:27:46.920000 - 0:27:50.920000::You know, you have to do that now, Jack. If Jack dies, you have to do that.
0:27:50.920000 - 0:28:00.920000::No, he played it just literally will. I'll do that. How how close are you to learning this song in guitar? Like you play a little bit of piano. Could you?
0:28:00.920000 - 0:28:06.920000::I think I'm probably 45 lessons away.
0:28:06.920000 - 0:28:16.920000::I was going to say that that is incredibly normal and incredibly healthy thought is I feel the same way when y'all die.
0:28:16.920000 - 0:28:24.920000::Both of y'all die like. Okay, here you know, here's my opportunity to people are going to be expected me to put on a show.
0:28:24.920000 - 0:28:31.920000::Right. If I don't know opera, if I don't know break dancing to for the after party, if I don't know how to cook because I'm a cater it.
0:28:31.920000 - 0:28:38.920000::I know there's going to be a lot of industry there. What can I sell? This is like I could sell a show based on my friend dying grief show about grief.
0:28:38.920000 - 0:28:41.920000::That's never been done. No one's ever explored grief before.
0:28:41.920000 - 0:28:50.920000::Not like we would. No, of course not. Who do you guys really think is going to die first of the three? I had a good one. Oh, I think.
0:28:50.920000 - 0:28:54.920000::Oh, you mean of us? I thought I was going to say Steven Tyler.
0:28:54.920000 - 0:29:04.920000::Oh, he's going. Oh, he's out. He's about by the way, he think he's up for reckoning some type of horrible. I think so. Yeah, but he's going to probably go before then.
0:29:04.920000 - 0:29:14.920000::All those 70s rock star. We know what you did. We know what you did. It was crazy. Don't try to hide any. Anybody who was alive in the 70s. Don't come near me.
0:29:14.920000 - 0:29:24.920000::No, they they get none of them. None of them. Nobody who is a touch in the 60s and 70s. They're all bad. What generation is that?
0:29:24.920000 - 0:29:33.920000::The boomers basically. I think it's a boomer. They are boomers. I think. What groomers? What would you do if I pay in my web came over.
0:29:33.920000 - 0:29:38.920000::I have a David Bowie wall right as here. There's nothing.

0:29:45.920000 - 0:29:50.920000::Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like a it's like a cliche like college dorm. I know.
0:29:50.920000 - 0:29:57.920000::Something about that picture in particular. I'm thinking. There's some cool. I don't get cringed out by anything anymore.
0:29:57.920000 - 0:30:00.920000::That's why we like.

0:30:10.200000 - 0:30:14.600000::Just a bucket like just got Michael. Yeah, a piece of butter that could never judge you
0:30:15.280000 - 0:30:21.860000::Right, that's how I feel you can be so you can be cringe you can be you can say whatever around Jack and that's why I'm trying to really

0:31:39.040000 - 0:31:44.800000::Like I would my attitude at work was just like just don't talk to me like I'm gonna do my work and leave you know and
0:31:46.080000 - 0:31:53.040000::At this you know at the escape room you have to work as a team to find these clues and stuff and
0:31:53.880000 - 0:31:57.560000::I remember my manager like pulled me aside like during the

0:32:44.120000 - 0:32:45.920000::have to be maybe
0:32:46.080000 - 0:32:47.920000::Either the most cursive
0:32:48.080000 - 0:32:54.200000::Horrible places or they're a place of magic and art in a I'm gonna guess magic

0:33:19.920000 - 0:33:22.840000::I like this is the biggest production we got this is Broadway
0:33:23.240000 - 0:33:30.560000::But be careful be careful with these haunted houses these small because if you see the name
0:33:31.440000 - 0:33:35.280000::McCabe manner manner. What's that run? Yeah

0:59:14.680000 - 0:59:20.680000::What gave me joy is I fell back into my love with runescape.
0:59:20.680000 - 0:59:29.680000::It's an old, old game where you walk around in medieval times and you can chat with each other and train your skills.
0:59:29.680000 - 0:59:33.680000::And just walking around, I talked to somebody and they start talking to me in Spanish.
0:59:33.680000 - 0:59:39.680000::I type back to them and I'm thinking, oh my god, I'm talking to somebody in Argentina over this ancient video game.
0:59:39.680000 - 0:59:46.680000::You know, as we may have mentioned, we met our friend Lucas Santangello, the male lifestyle influencer and London on runescape over the pandemic.
0:59:46.680000 - 0:59:53.680000::So reconnecting with that has been giving me a lot of joy and it's not an addiction.
0:59:53.680000 - 0:59:55.680000::No, shout out, runescape.
0:59:55.680000 - 0:59:57.680000::That is old version.
0:59:57.680000 - 0:59:58.680000::Old time.
0:59:58.680000 - 0:59:59.680000::Oh, wait, real quick.

1:00:57.500000 - 1:01:03.620000::It might be a little bit more colorically dense, but it's damn it's damn fucking delicious
1:01:03.620000 - 1:01:05.780000::And I'm having a good time eating the food here
