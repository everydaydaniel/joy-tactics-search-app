0:01:18 - 0:01:26::And I just want people to believe me from now on because people were doubting me that something awesome was coming down the pipeline.

0:01:52 - 0:01:54::And a lot of people are jealous.
0:01:54 - 0:01:57::Well, we'll get into that in a little bit.
0:01:57 - 0:01:59::People are very, very jealous.
0:01:59 - 0:02:01::We're on Joytex.
0:02:01 - 0:02:03::We'll go into the envy.
0:02:03 - 0:02:09::So let's get into the joy of it all. Let's get into the process. So this is a highly regarded television show.
0:02:09 - 0:02:20::We, you know, we're kind of tapped like, hey guys, we know that you guys are ushering in a new era of comedy.
0:02:20 - 0:02:24::I don't even know. Yeah, I guess comedy, but just real human art.
0:02:24 - 0:02:26::This is a new form of entertainment.
0:02:26 - 0:02:28::The form of entertainment. Right, right, right.
0:02:28 - 0:02:40::And we'd be remissed is a word that they used if we didn't just, you know, put a little homage.
0:02:40 - 0:02:44::You know, it's kind of like how Hitchcock appears in every one of his movies.
0:02:44 - 0:02:45::Right.
0:02:45 - 0:02:48::Or like there's a pickle on it, whatever.
0:02:48 - 0:02:58::So you can see that we're going to start popping up as little people just want to pay tribute because they know that the projects that are going to come out.
0:02:58 - 0:03:00::Hello, oh, sorry. I'm in here.
0:03:00 - 0:03:01::Sorry.
0:03:01 - 0:03:03::Oh, I'm checking out a little later.
0:03:03 - 0:03:04::Yeah.
0:03:04 - 0:03:07::And this is just a lifestyle, by the way, of traveling.
0:03:07 - 0:03:09::Oh, is it late checkout?
0:03:09 - 0:03:12::Oh, my God. Maybe I'll check in with them. I'm sorry.
0:03:12 - 0:03:16::Yeah, this is just what it's like traveling and being on the road, man.
0:03:16 - 0:03:17::Oh, God.
0:03:17 - 0:03:18::It's just another.
0:03:18 - 0:03:21::I really have to be checked out by right now. Are you kidding me?
0:03:21 - 0:03:22::Oh, my God.
0:03:22 - 0:03:26::Eric, call your managers right now and tell them what happened and that.
0:03:26 - 0:03:32::And if that hotel wants to stay open, they'll listen to what you have to say.
0:03:32 - 0:03:40::Eric, you just, you just love that so hard because what you should have said to the room service coming in is, yeah, you know who I am, right?
0:03:40 - 0:03:47::I feel like Eric, you're at the point where you can say some shit like that and be mean to kind of civilians outside of the industry.
0:03:47 - 0:03:48::Look at the room. You're in.
0:03:48 - 0:03:50::You're not in a regular hotel room, dude.
0:03:50 - 0:03:52::No, I see those two chairs behind you.
0:03:52 - 0:03:54::That's not what they call us. It's a sweet.
0:03:54 - 0:03:57::Yeah, definitely. It's got the mini fridge and the microwave.
0:03:57 - 0:03:58::Yeah, this is a sweet.
0:03:58 - 0:03:59::Yeah.
0:03:59 - 0:04:02::And for real, I think I should call the front desk right now.
0:04:02 - 0:04:03::Call them up, man.
0:04:03 - 0:04:04::Do it.
0:04:04 - 0:04:05::In case.
0:04:05 - 0:04:06::Call.
0:04:06 - 0:04:07::Give them a call.
0:04:07 - 0:04:11::All right. This would be the most embarrassing thing I've done on the podcast.
0:04:11 - 0:04:13::Let's see.
0:04:13 - 0:04:14::Shout out to you.
0:04:14 - 0:04:17::All right. I'm calling them right now.
0:04:17 - 0:04:19::Well, while you're dialing the.
0:04:19 - 0:04:20::Here comes.
0:04:20 - 0:04:25::Hi, this is Eric Rahill. I'm in room 305.
0:04:25 - 0:04:29::And I guess I just missed my, I didn't realize check out was at 11 a.m.
0:04:29 - 0:04:32::Is there any way to extend my checkout slightly here?
0:04:32 - 0:04:35::You have 30 minutes because I have to clean the room.
0:04:35 - 0:04:37::Oh my god. Okay, 30 minutes.
0:04:37 - 0:04:39::Okay. Thank you very much.
0:04:39 - 0:04:41::All right. Bye.
0:04:41 - 0:04:45::Well, you guys heard that that was a thank call everyone.
0:04:45 - 0:04:47::Kind of you said thank you at the end.
0:04:47 - 0:04:49::Did you guys hear what just happened?
0:04:49 - 0:04:51::You have 30 minutes to get the hell out of here.
0:04:51 - 0:04:53::So what the hell is going to happen?
0:04:53 - 0:04:54::It's an escape room.
0:04:54 - 0:04:55::All right.
0:04:55 - 0:04:56::I haven't packed up one damn.
0:04:56 - 0:04:58::I think I haven't showered.
0:04:58 - 0:05:00::This is your fault, Eric.
0:05:00 - 0:05:01::And you need.
0:05:01 - 0:05:02::Yeah.

0:05:00 - 0:05:10::You're not getting out of this one, dude. You can't just say, oh, well, can we record it later or something like this?
0:05:10 - 0:05:16::Like this is it. This is it. We're doing a 30 minute episode today. I refuse to talk to Nate one on one. He's weird.
0:05:16 - 0:05:21::This is my fault, guys. Isn't it? Good God in heaven. Good God.
0:05:21 - 0:05:26::No, it's gonna be okay. Hey, let's... Well, Eric, what do you think?
0:05:27 - 0:05:30::I don't know. I just don't know.
0:05:30 - 0:05:41::Are you thinking we do a 30 minute episode? Are you thinking you could maybe move to the lobby and do it in a Verone style where you're fully in public and just going for it?
0:05:41 - 0:05:48::I definitely could do that. That is an option. Honestly, that is an option to go out there.
0:05:48 - 0:05:53::We could... We could... Yeah, if you want to take a shower, we can pause right now.
0:05:53 - 0:05:56::You still have your own team. Come back and then I'll be ready and do it.
0:05:56 - 0:06:02::We're gonna jump cut here. Ready? I'm gonna snap and when I snap, Eric's gonna be... Eric, you do it. Eric, you snap.
0:06:02 - 0:06:05::And then you're gonna be... When you see me again, I will be in deep...
0:06:05 - 0:06:13::Guess what, everybody? You are now entering the lobby of the Windom by Wingate here in Tindley Park. It's a beautiful scene.
0:06:13 - 0:06:16::We're going to this American lifestyle with this one.
0:06:16 - 0:06:21::You may hear the juice machine kind of churning the cranberry juice and the orange juice.
0:06:21 - 0:06:25::You may hear some other noises.
0:06:25 - 0:06:33::That's cool. That's what it's like to be anywhere. It's not natural to listen to a podcast without background noise.
0:06:33 - 0:06:37::Actually, you may be driving you and all of humanity insane.
0:06:37 - 0:06:44::Right, because that's not the real world. Everybody is so distracted by VR, this entertainment constant feeds.
0:06:44 - 0:06:50::So forget what it's like to be just in a lobby with a hotel. There's the trash fucking bin rolling around.
0:06:50 - 0:06:55::It's like ASMR. And we're fooling ourselves with people, if we think people are gonna hate this.
0:06:55 - 0:06:58::Yeah, right. This is the truth. You know what I'm saying?
0:06:58 - 0:07:01::Like everybody's recording in booths and studios, like...
0:07:01 - 0:07:08::I'm sorry, we're out in the fucking world experiencing life for a fucking for once and for a change.
0:07:08 - 0:07:10::Is that so wrong? Right.
0:07:10 - 0:07:15::And by the way, we have lives. Like we are doing this. It's a service that we're doing as podcasts.
0:07:15 - 0:07:19::But listen, I have to work. I should put food on the table for my family.
0:07:19 - 0:07:25::And guess what? That means I might be in the lobby of a window by a window by a window sometimes.
0:07:25 - 0:07:26::Okay.
0:07:26 - 0:07:32::By the way, if you see us on the street, say thank you for your service and treat us like kind of like military service members.
0:07:32 - 0:07:35::And really just treat us with that respect.
0:07:35 - 0:07:38::We should have kind of a uniform, a joy tactics uniform. Right.
0:07:38 - 0:07:39::People can...
0:07:39 - 0:07:41::A gig. A fatigue.
0:07:41 - 0:07:42::A gig, a gig.
0:07:42 - 0:07:44::And hand them out to all the patrons.
0:07:44 - 0:07:45::And pass...
0:07:45 - 0:07:51::We can kind of have a societal rule that like these are the people that should be more respected than other people in our society.
0:07:51 - 0:07:59::But just because they, you know, have a certain set of values that are incredible and kind of push you in towards...
0:07:59 - 0:08:01::Yeah.
0:08:02 - 0:08:04::But let's not forget what this episode about is about.
0:08:04 - 0:08:11::This episode is about our crazy ass comp that nobody saw coming to everybody's thought that we were not going to fucking make it.
0:08:11 - 0:08:14::And then they wanted to put us in a box.
0:08:14 - 0:08:16::Imagine this.
0:08:16 - 0:08:18::Imagine this, right?
0:08:18 - 0:08:20::Somebody says,
0:08:20 - 0:08:22::Oh, hey.
0:08:22 - 0:08:25::Are you free next month?
0:08:25 - 0:08:26::Oh, yeah.
0:08:26 - 0:08:27::I am actually.
0:08:27 - 0:08:28::Why?
0:08:28 - 0:08:31::Because you know that you're to the bear? Yeah, of course.
0:08:31 - 0:08:33::Well, they...
0:08:33 - 0:08:36::Turns out they love you like family.
0:08:36 - 0:08:37::Yeah.
0:08:37 - 0:08:39::And they love your family like their family.
0:08:39 - 0:08:40::And they're going to put...
0:08:40 - 0:08:48::And so, not only do they want you to be a part of this family, but they want to bring your family to make one giant bigger family.
0:08:48 - 0:08:51::And so, when they said that,
0:08:52 - 0:08:53::in the same breath,
0:08:53 - 0:08:55::Nate Verone, Eric Grayhill,
0:08:55 - 0:08:57::and you are all going to be doing...
0:08:57 - 0:08:58::Oh my God, what is it?
0:08:58 - 0:09:00::What's going to happen?
0:09:00 - 0:09:02::Well, and then they said,
0:09:02 - 0:09:05::So, oh, what are the logistics?
0:09:05 - 0:09:07::They said, you know United Arab Emirates?
0:09:07 - 0:09:09::I said, yeah, but they only find it like the UAE.
0:09:09 - 0:09:10::What do you mean?
0:09:10 - 0:09:11::Right.
0:09:11 - 0:09:12::They said, well,
0:09:12 - 0:09:13::right.
0:09:13 - 0:09:19::Normally, they only find the UAE, but they're making an exception for this.
0:09:19 - 0:09:22::And so, we flew first class around the other...
0:09:22 - 0:09:23::The wrong way.
0:09:23 - 0:09:26::East from New York, back to Chicago.
0:09:26 - 0:09:28::Stop it and then you will buy.
0:09:28 - 0:09:29::Yep.
0:09:29 - 0:09:30::Whatever.
0:09:30 - 0:09:32::Back on the thing, sleeping.
0:09:32 - 0:09:33::Best sleep in my life.
0:09:33 - 0:09:34::Land it midway.
0:09:34 - 0:09:36::Let's do another lap.
0:09:36 - 0:09:39::Do another lap around the globe.
0:09:39 - 0:09:40::Shephin.
0:09:40 - 0:09:42::And you can out imagine the models.
0:09:42 - 0:09:45::They have the male and female models they have working as the flight attendants.
0:09:45 - 0:09:48::You get one look at this person and you think, God is real.
0:09:48 - 0:09:49::You know what?
0:09:49 - 0:09:50::You know what?
0:09:50 - 0:09:51::What?

0:10:22.520000 - 0:10:28.280000::I have to acknowledge because I think the listeners can hear this there are maybe more trash bags being put into trash bins
0:10:28.280000 - 0:10:30.280000::than I've ever heard it my entire life
0:10:33.440000 - 0:10:37.600000::Well people are congratulations everybody because you are now

0:11:21.720000 - 0:11:25.560000::It smelled good. It was just some it was a level of
0:11:26.200000 - 0:11:32.400000::Human flawlessness in the way that the magazines tried to portray that I had never witnessed in person
0:11:32.400000 - 0:11:36.400000::I don't ever will witness in person ever again. Maybe I've seen it two or three times, but
0:11:38.360000 - 0:11:42.800000::That was special. I remember just feeling that way when I saw his back at front in
0:11:43.800000 - 0:11:45.800000::high school musical and
0:11:45.800000 - 0:11:49.160000::That was at my Nana's house and I was laying on the bed on my tummy

0:11:53.640000 - 0:11:56.160000::And I remember I had my hair all along at the time
0:11:56.880000 - 0:12:00.920000::Skater style, but it looked more like a young Homer Simpson than it did Jack at front
0:12:00.920000 - 0:12:04.720000::And I would look at TV look at Zach at front with Vanessa Hedges whatever
0:12:05.400000 - 0:12:09.440000::Then look back at myself then look at Zach at front and high school musical hall
0:12:09.440000 - 0:12:14::Beautiful it was then look back at my double chin and think you are not worthy, dude
0:12:14 - 0:12:18.160000::And I remember shaking my fucking head and thinking oh come on. This is the day it begins
0:12:18.520000 - 0:12:24.120000::This is the day that you always look back to and say this was day one of the rest of your life
0:12:27.760000 - 0:12:31.320000::I do that for memory though like looking in my Nana's fucking mirror
0:12:31.840000 - 0:12:38.120000::Well high school musical is playing and thinking like God need to fucking be that right now, please God you kind of wear that
0:12:38.120000 - 0:12:40.120000::I busted now though
0:12:40.480000 - 0:12:43.440000::You're swing Zach at front. Yeah, he probably looks at you
0:12:44.200000 - 0:12:48.840000::Now now he probably looks at you like that because you are now in your prime
0:12:48.840000 - 0:12:54.200000::And he's now looks like fucking Larry the lobster or whatever he looks okay. Oh Larry the lobster is hot as hell though
0:12:54.200000 - 0:12:59.440000::Who is that you kidding me Larry the lobster? He was the big love fucking ripped ass. Oh, he looked good, but he didn't look
0:12:59.920000 - 0:13:05.280000::There's a there's a level of good where you start to not look human. I have a question about what
0:13:06.600000 - 0:13:12.960000::He's a lobster there's I have a question about the phrase plastic surgery. Well, it's here. Why does they call it plastic?
0:13:13.440000 - 0:13:15.960000::Why is that that they do that? What are they called?
0:13:15.960000 - 0:13:23.540000::Plastic surgery. Is it because they put plastic on you? I think it's in reference to the plasticity of the face and how you can morph and
0:13:24.560000 - 0:13:31.560000::Yeah, mm-hmm. Wow. Yeah, that's crazy. I didn't I love that explanation true or not
0:13:31.560000 - 0:13:35.920000::This may be the most unlistenable episode of a podcast that's ever been
0:13:36.840000 - 0:13:38.840000::But I'll be well
0:13:38.840000 - 0:13:45.520000::I know fucking we're gonna have to yeah, that's perfect for the for the for the
0:13:45.720000 - 0:13:47.720000::show
0:13:47.720000 - 0:13:54.160000::We are all three well, we we are at a different level at this point all three of us
0:13:54.400000 - 0:13:59.720000::Yeah, TV stars right now, and I think people are just gonna have to put up with
0:14:00.480000 - 0:14:03.160000::some things, you know, right? We're
0:14:03.960000 - 0:14:05.960000::mentally
0:14:06.200000 - 0:14:11.920000::And like I think people are just gonna like we should be treated differently, you know what I'm saying?
0:14:11.920000 - 0:14:15.680000::I feel like people are people have been in my life. They've been they've been
0:14:16.640000 - 0:14:19.120000::You know not being as mean to me and
0:14:20.880000 - 0:14:22.400000::kind of
0:14:22.400000 - 0:14:24.720000::Everyone on the street is just kind of looking at me like
0:14:26.400000 - 0:14:30.400000::I don't know your name, but like I definitely binge this shit last week
0:14:31.040000 - 0:14:38.360000::Or this this week and yeah, I recognize you man. Oh, she peanut butter. Are you are you peanut butter?

0:14:47.680000 - 0:14:49.680000::Like whatever I'm hearing out there
0:14:52.160000 - 0:14:58.840000::No, I don't care. I don't care about the quality of the podcast because I don't give a fuck the podcast is essentially over
0:14:58.840000 - 0:15:01.120000::You like

0:15:00 - 0:15:05.960000::This is a feeling that I've been described using to describe a lot of things lately that initiated in email to neighborhood
0:15:06.160000 - 0:15:10.440000::Yeah, top secret I can't discuss it and shout out to hotel workers
0:15:10.440000 - 0:15:15.360000::They are amazing workers and they are highly unionized. They have high union density and they get amazing protections
0:15:15.960000 - 0:15:20.700000::Be proud of those occupations, but the the feeling is this
0:15:22.040000 - 0:15:27.440000::When you're playing an open-world video game. Did I say this on the last episode? No, no, no
0:15:27.440000 - 0:15:29.440000::This is such an incredible
0:15:30.720000 - 0:15:33.040000::Viewpoint of the world say it's a
0:15:34.160000 - 0:15:36.160000::Sometimes you'll feel this way
0:15:36.680000 - 0:15:39.840000::where if you've ever played an open-world video game and
0:15:41.160000 - 0:15:45.100000::You finished all the quests and you're just walking around
0:15:45.680000 - 0:15:50.320000::You have nothing left to do you just in this hollow environment
0:15:51.160000 - 0:15:52.520000::where
0:15:52.680000 - 0:15:57.880000::Suddenly the stage lights are on it's as if the as if the house lights went on in the sky
0:15:58.240000 - 0:16:04::You know what I'm saying and you can see the grid of the stars you can see the what are they call that where they hang the lights
0:16:05.520000 - 0:16:07.520000::Yeah, after you can see the life rafters
0:16:07.520000 - 0:16:10.400000::the rafters connecting the stars and the planets above you and
0:16:13.280000 - 0:16:16.880000::That's how I feel about this podcast right now. It's like we did it. We succeeded
0:16:16.880000 - 0:16:18.880000::We're here just kind of lingering in the lobby
0:16:19.440000 - 0:16:26.840000::Just kind of looking around but right over and I also use that to describe the way that I feel when I listen to Joe Paradoo stand up
0:16:27.520000 - 0:16:30.160000::It's like there's an NPC that you haven't
0:16:30.560000 - 0:16:35.280000::Haven't witnessed yet you beat the game and then you find this guy who's kind of sitting around with like a coffee mug
0:16:35.280000 - 0:16:40.920000::The guy character and he has like a side quest that like you really like care about like yeah
0:16:42.200000 - 0:16:44.200000::But it's like the longest quest in the whole game
0:16:44.640000 - 0:16:46.640000::You
0:16:47.680000 - 0:16:54.160000::Don't get anything from it, but it's like something that the art of the people who designed the universe really care about
0:16:55.200000 - 0:16:57.200000::Joe pairs in a Pixar movie
0:17:00.200000 - 0:17:05.560000::What the hell he's a voice in the new elemental what's elemental?
0:17:06.120000 - 0:17:09.960000::Beside the new is Pixar movie dude from Disney Pixar about
0:17:09.960000 - 0:17:15.500000::About the elements are is but what do you mean elements earth went fire water and magnesium exactly man?
0:17:15.500000 - 0:17:21.880000::Oh shit, I wonder what element he is and guess what the the kind of lesson of this is that elements aren't supposed to mix
0:17:21.880000 - 0:17:26.220000::And they have this kind of city where there is fire and then fires
0:17:27 - 0:17:29.400000::Away from the wind and the water
0:17:30 - 0:17:36.080000::And to trick people and they don't like each other and there's kind of a racism thing going on
0:17:36.080000 - 0:17:39.400000::No, no, no, no, no, no, we find out that yes
0:17:40.200000 - 0:17:44.320000::He's well or you you already know it's gonna happen as fun Joe pair is racist
0:17:45.040000 - 0:17:51.560000::Joe Pergus so fucking racist as a large tree like a hydrogen atom
0:17:54.680000 - 0:17:58.880000::Joe pair of the racist yeah, it's our tick a weird turn to this one, but you know
0:18:00.400000 - 0:18:05.160000::Can I just say that Pixar needs to go back to the day because guess what this is we've seen this shit before guys
0:18:05.160000 - 0:18:11.480000::We have seen this shit in a different form before Pixar can we get a movie about something just something fucking crazy out of this world
0:18:11.480000 - 0:18:17.800000::You know, yeah, yeah, just remember the brave a little toaster. We've discussed this. We've just discussed this at length
0:18:17.800000 - 0:18:25.600000::Yeah, maybe like an amoral I think they got it because here's what the here's what the structure is always is positive morals
0:18:25.680000 - 0:18:30.920000::But if they just switch the moral frames at a little bit on these movies will get a lot more variety
0:18:30.920000 - 0:18:36.720000::I swear to God if the more morality of it is pretty neutral and nuanced like real life
0:18:36.720000 - 0:18:42.640000::That's a lesson for kids guess what nobody's perfect for real and people are actually evil
0:18:42.640000 - 0:18:48.120000::But they can also be beautiful and they can also do wonderful things but have committed horrible crimes. Yeah
0:18:48.640000 - 0:18:55.480000::We need to start. Yeah, go ahead. I think you should get into 3D animation and oh
0:18:55.880000 - 0:19:02.040000::You get into or get into more because guess what I'm doing now that I'm led off is basically a bunch of research
0:19:02.040000 - 0:19:09.400000::I haven't animated it yet, but I'm picturing this shit. I want to animate and it's human beings and it's special type of way
0:19:10.400000 - 0:19:13.520000::You and I you want to make animated humans that be crazy
0:19:14.200000 - 0:19:17.040000::That would be crazy. What would that even look like a dude?
0:19:18.280000 - 0:19:21.120000::And or girl or whoever I'll do their everybody
0:19:21.760000 - 0:19:25.320000::Right depending on what where you let what region you're in right
0:19:28.920000 - 0:19:32.600000::But you know that oh, sorry. Let's so this is what I want to know
0:19:33.600000 - 0:19:39.360000::So there are milestones that people achieve in their life and their career and
0:19:40.520000 - 0:19:41.880000::I
0:19:41.880000 - 0:19:47.560000::Think we've been around the block enough to know that you can't be really satisfied by these achievements
0:19:47.560000 - 0:19:51.240000::They can't bring you happy. I just you you may think that they they
0:19:51.960000 - 0:19:56.520000::They will bring you joy and happiness, but this is joy tactics that we just need to be honest and real
0:19:57.800000 - 0:19:59.800000::Because what happens when you get right

0:20:00 - 0:20:00.840000::Go ahead, Nate.
0:20:00.840000 - 0:20:06.480000::If you are, if you think that, hmm, once I get this job
0:20:06.480000 - 0:20:08.640000::promotion, then I'll be happy.
0:20:08.640000 - 0:20:12.800000::Once I get this, you know, run this marathon,
0:20:12.800000 - 0:20:13.880000::then I'll be happy.
0:20:13.880000 - 0:20:14.800000::Guess what?
0:20:14.800000 - 0:20:16.280000::If you're thinking that way, guess what?
0:20:16.280000 - 0:20:19.200000::You will never be happy in your life ever.
0:20:19.200000 - 0:20:20.840000::Unless you change some shit right now.
0:20:20.840000 - 0:20:23.280000::So we went into this thinking, yeah, this is,
0:20:23.280000 - 0:20:24.780000::I was telling people in the crew, I'm like,
0:20:24.780000 - 0:20:27::I'm actually not gonna be happy when this comes out.
0:20:27 - 0:20:29.560000::Like this is gonna bring me any joy or happiness.
0:20:29.560000 - 0:20:31.760000::I'm gonna be grateful for it as fuck,
0:20:31.760000 - 0:20:33.960000::but it's not gonna bring me an ounce of joy and happiness
0:20:33.960000 - 0:20:36.240000::because I'm involved consciously,
0:20:36.240000 - 0:20:38.160000::away beyond this type of shit.
0:20:38.160000 - 0:20:40.520000::And material things cannot give me any satisfaction,
0:20:40.520000 - 0:20:41.760000::joy or pleasure.
0:20:41.760000 - 0:20:42.600000::Right.
0:20:42.600000 - 0:20:44.640000::And I know that true happiness comes from within
0:20:44.640000 - 0:20:48.280000::and the relationships and people that you have in your life.
0:20:48.280000 - 0:20:49.440000::Right.
0:20:49.440000 - 0:20:52.960000::Well, I was getting a lot of emails, calls, messages,
0:20:52.960000 - 0:20:54.360000::people coming out of the woodwork,
0:20:54.360000 - 0:20:57.640000::just saying like, yo, Eric, we have believed in you
0:20:57.640000 - 0:21:00.240000::for so long and we saw you basically body that,
0:21:00.240000 - 0:21:05::basically extra role on the bear and we wanna know
0:21:05 - 0:21:06.480000::what it's like to be in your head right now.
0:21:06.480000 - 0:21:09.800000::Like, what are you going on a bender in a good way?
0:21:09.800000 - 0:21:10.640000::You know what I mean?
0:21:10.640000 - 0:21:11.480000::Did you treat yourself tough?
0:21:11.480000 - 0:21:14.480000::I can luxur, sweet, and vagus by yourself.
0:21:14.480000 - 0:21:17.080000::I'm crazy to live in your mind, throwing shit
0:21:17.080000 - 0:21:19.280000::at the windows in a good way.
0:21:19.280000 - 0:21:21.200000::And I was like, no, guess what?
0:21:21.200000 - 0:21:23.200000::Here's what I did when the episode came out.
0:21:23.200000 - 0:21:26.840000::I was working another job looking for the next thing.
0:21:26.840000 - 0:21:28.960000::We're thinking about my next character that I'm playing
0:21:28.960000 - 0:21:29.800000::because guess what?
0:21:29.800000 - 0:21:30.640000::Party goer number two.
0:21:30.640000 - 0:21:32.440000::Yeah, that consumed about four months of my life
0:21:32.440000 - 0:21:34.280000::trying to figure out what he was all about,
0:21:34.280000 - 0:21:36.120000::what he should've was before I entered that scene
0:21:36.120000 - 0:21:37.440000::with Jeremy Allen White.
0:21:37.440000 - 0:21:39.600000::But then I'm out of it and I'm like,
0:21:39.600000 - 0:21:41.880000::I don't even remember I did that job barely.
0:21:41.880000 - 0:21:43.800000::I just remember that I got to do the next thing.
0:21:43.800000 - 0:21:48.280000::Well, you had a whole, like, I know you had like,
0:21:48.280000 - 0:21:51.120000::you said you're an extra in the show, basically,
0:21:51.120000 - 0:21:54.720000::but they shot, basically, you had a whole arc
0:21:54.720000 - 0:21:55.920000::for this season.
0:21:55.920000 - 0:21:58.640000::If I remember correctly, because you were there for months
0:21:58.640000 - 0:22:02.720000::and they had this whole kind of side story with you
0:22:02.720000 - 0:22:06.120000::and Carmie were kind of like best friends
0:22:06.120000 - 0:22:08.080000::and getting all fucked up together.
0:22:08.080000 - 0:22:10.320000::And you guys actually got wasted in a scene.
0:22:10.320000 - 0:22:13.960000::And I know what happened, because it sounded so fruitful
0:22:13.960000 - 0:22:15.720000::to the whole series, but.
0:22:15.720000 - 0:22:16.720000::I think it was a glitch.
0:22:16.720000 - 0:22:19.840000::I think it's in the cut, but there's like, yeah.
0:22:19.840000 - 0:22:22.400000::I think what happened here was like,
0:22:23.360000 - 0:22:25.160000::we had such a connection.
0:22:25.160000 - 0:22:27.840000::Like, you know, you have chemistry with different performers
0:22:27.840000 - 0:22:29.800000::and like, we had an amazing chemistry.
0:22:29.800000 - 0:22:32.840000::And essentially, we had such a good time filming
0:22:32.840000 - 0:22:34.440000::all those other things and we were like going,
0:22:34.440000 - 0:22:36.720000::it wasn't in Chicago, they flew us out to Miami
0:22:36.720000 - 0:22:38.120000::and some other places to shoot it
0:22:38.120000 - 0:22:39.280000::because it's a whole other arc
0:22:39.280000 - 0:22:41.560000::where we get involved with all these beautiful women.
0:22:41.560000 - 0:22:42.400000::Cartel.
0:22:42.400000 - 0:22:45.920000::And essentially, they were like, it was like an amazing,
0:22:45.920000 - 0:22:48.560000::bunch of amazing scenes that was getting sent to Can by itself
0:22:48.560000 - 0:22:51.360000::as it's standalone movies and shit, but.
0:22:51.440000 - 0:22:53.480000::They just thought like, you know, it's too much of a departure,
0:22:53.480000 - 0:22:56.920000::but they were like, we are considering like a crazy ass new.
0:22:56.920000 - 0:22:58.280000::I don't want to even say it
0:22:58.280000 - 0:22:59.480000::because I want to be knocking on wood.
0:22:59.480000 - 0:23:01.040000::I want this shit to come true so bad,
0:23:01.040000 - 0:23:04.720000::but you might be seeing a spin off pretty quickly here
0:23:04.720000 - 0:23:06.960000::called the air, or the whatever.
0:23:06.960000 - 0:23:08.360000::Okay, I didn't want to say it.

0:33:21.240000 - 0:33:28.880000::where you need to teach a like linguistics class at MIT alternative linguistics here's the thing
0:33:28.880000 - 0:33:35.920000::for the 30-year-old white male I'm not teaching anything ever again I am formally teaching
0:33:35.920000 - 0:33:41.400000::anything ever again because what you realize is this you went to college for four years can
0:33:41.400000 - 0:33:47.160000::you name every single class you did in every single word you ever heard no I actually can't
0:33:47.160000 - 0:33:56.360000::so here's the thing can you name and recite every single song that you heard in college yes that's

0:34:01.640000 - 0:34:08.520000::remember them people so what's interesting is if you teaching is just the wrong thing it's the
0:34:08.520000 - 0:34:15.640000::wrong way to make like I say to make knowledge go into your long-term memory to give it significance
0:34:16.840000 - 0:34:25.400000::so what I would do if I had colleges you come into class philosophy class and I play you a song
0:34:25.400000 - 0:34:30.680000::about whatever it is linguistics song so yeah if I had a linguistics class you'd come in and you'd
0:34:30.680000 - 0:34:36.120000::hear rap song and like we're a way of English that you've never heard in your fucking life I'm
0:34:36.120000 - 0:34:44.360000::going to do rap god but the words are going to be like I guess not like that not like that but
0:34:45.240000 - 0:34:52.600000::I have an approach to learning knowledge that I developed because of my inability to perceive knowledge
0:34:53.160000 - 0:34:59.720000::kind of gave me an enabling constraint which forced me to develop a new way of thinking
0:34:59.720000 - 0:35:00.040000::and

0:35:00 - 0:35:05::And listen, it's been many years since I've pond anything
0:35:07.920000 - 0:35:09.480000::that any of my friends own.
0:35:09.480000 - 0:35:11.860000::I'm a good person now.

0:35:18.440000 - 0:35:22.200000::And very mysterious circumstances,
0:35:22.200000 - 0:35:24.800000::but we appreciate him and our thoughts
0:35:24.800000 - 0:35:28.080000::are with his friends and family at this time.
0:35:28.080000 - 0:35:29.480000::It is funny to be floundering

0:35:38.960000 - 0:35:42.280000::we're gonna let you, you know, like sometimes talking.
0:35:42.280000 - 0:35:45.440000::We all know, we all know that there is,
0:35:45.440000 - 0:35:48.360000::that you're on a fucking verbal ramp, dude.
0:35:48.360000 - 0:35:51.440000::And you're about to hit that fucking crazy vertical,
0:35:51.440000 - 0:35:54.400000::so it's just, who knows what's happening?
0:35:54.400000 - 0:35:55.240000::You know what I'm saying?
0:35:55.240000 - 0:35:57.080000::I'm just, it's like hitting a slot machine button.
0:35:57.080000 - 0:35:57.920000::Come on, come on.
0:35:58.080000 - 0:36:01.880000::That's literally, and then that's what I was gonna say,
0:36:01.880000 - 0:36:04.040000::because that is what listening to me
0:36:04.040000 - 0:36:05.800000::and interacting and working with me is like, is like,
0:36:05.800000 - 0:36:06.880000::it's a gamble, it's a gamble.
0:36:06.880000 - 0:36:08.920000::It's a fucking gamble and the highs
0:36:08.920000 - 0:36:11.360000::are just so fucking high in their life changing.
0:36:11.360000 - 0:36:12.200000::Yeah.

0:36:13.200000 - 0:36:14.840000::The lows are not lows,
0:36:14.840000 - 0:36:17.200000::but they're kind of like a smoke bomb going off.
0:36:17.200000 - 0:36:19.480000::It's like, I didn't get any limbs, I'm not injured,
0:36:19.480000 - 0:36:21.520000::but I'm like, I don't know what the fuck is going on.
0:36:21.520000 - 0:36:22.680000::I'm scared.
0:36:22.680000 - 0:36:25.760000::Can I really quick comment in real life,
0:36:25.760000 - 0:36:29::how bad it feels right now to be podcasting
0:36:29 - 0:36:30.880000::in an area where people are trying to clean?
0:36:31.960000 - 0:36:33.520000::They're people working on it.
0:36:33.520000 - 0:36:35.520000::That's beautiful, dude.

0:36:36.360000 - 0:36:38.840000::It's a next level, it's kind of like rejection therapy,
0:36:38.840000 - 0:36:41.400000::where you have to put yourself in humiliating circumstances
0:36:41.400000 - 0:36:43.200000::and just sit through it.
0:36:43.200000 - 0:36:46.680000::So you know that, I think that is a people pleasing
0:36:49 - 0:36:51.760000::attack to overcome people pleasing.
0:36:51.760000 - 0:36:55::Should I go through rejection therapy on this podcast?
0:36:55 - 0:36:55.840000::What is that?
0:36:55.840000 - 0:36:57.640000::Yes, yes, absolutely.
0:36:57.640000 - 0:36:59.320000::You want us to reject you?
0:36:59.320000 - 0:37:01.880000::No, I need to go, I need to get missions every week
0:37:01.880000 - 0:37:04.280000::of something that may be humiliating,
0:37:04.280000 - 0:37:06.320000::may cause me social discomfort
0:37:06.320000 - 0:37:07.480000::that I need to follow through on
0:37:07.480000 - 0:37:09.680000::and I need accountability, okay?

0:40:53.040000 - 0:40:53.960000::I don't know.
0:40:53.960000 - 0:40:54.960000::I don't know.
0:40:54.960000 - 0:40:58.480000::Your tactics needs to be the only type of content podcast on.
0:40:58.480000 - 0:41:00.200000::We need to pause on all YouTubers.
0:41:00.200000 - 0:41:02.960000::We need to pause on everything right now.
0:41:02.960000 - 0:41:07.080000::We can't just have a world filled with just creators that walking everywhere.
0:41:07.560000 - 0:41:08.320000::Just no.
0:41:08.520000 - 0:41:09.400000::I think it's cute.
0:41:09.400000 - 0:41:09.920000::I like it.
0:41:09.920000 - 0:41:12.320000::And I just say that that brought me down somehow.
0:41:13.040000 - 0:41:15.840000::I was like, I was part of a brother that I don't want to be in.
0:41:16.080000 - 0:41:16.760000::You got to work.
0:41:16.760000 - 0:41:17.800000::You got to be worried.
0:41:17.880000 - 0:41:19::I would just say this.
0:41:19.600000 - 0:41:24.920000::I see a young, seemingly straight white male filming himself.
0:41:25.360000 - 0:41:28.880000::Walking around in a suburb of a major city.
0:41:29.320000 - 0:41:29.600000::Yeah.
0:41:29.600000 - 0:41:30.200000::America.
0:41:30.640000 - 0:41:30.960000::Yeah.
0:41:30.960000 - 0:41:33.120000::Watch the front doors of the building you're in.
0:41:33.400000 - 0:41:37.080000::That's all I'm going to say because no, no, no, no, he didn't.
0:41:37.080000 - 0:41:38.240000::God in the bags or anything.
0:41:38.240000 - 0:41:39.080000::I can see.
0:41:39.080000 - 0:41:40.440000::I guess what it says.
0:41:40.440000 - 0:41:43.040000::There's a no gun sticker on the fucking door.
0:41:43.040000 - 0:41:44.640000::So he wouldn't dare come in here.
0:41:44.640000 - 0:41:46.400000::He's a close one.
0:41:46.400000 - 0:41:47.440000::I fucks with stickers.
0:41:47.440000 - 0:41:49.200000::One of the most effective things on the planet.
0:41:49.200000 - 0:41:50.280000::Oh my God.
0:41:50.400000 - 0:41:51.640000::Can I say this about the bear?
0:41:51.920000 - 0:41:52.400000::Yeah.
0:41:52.400000 - 0:41:52.680000::Yeah.
0:41:53 - 0:41:59.240000::Because I have not mentioned this yet, but you're probably looking at my role on the bear.
0:42:00.400000 - 0:42:07.960000::And you're going like, was that a role or how is it even possible that you're able to be so natural with this?
0:42:07.960000 - 0:42:10.040000::How did you fit right in in such a crazy way?
0:42:10.440000 - 0:42:10.800000::Right.
0:42:10.800000 - 0:42:11.600000::Here's the truth.
0:42:12.720000 - 0:42:15.120000::We all lived in Chicago where the show takes place.
0:42:15.640000 - 0:42:16.760000::That's what people don't get.
0:42:16.760000 - 0:42:17.280000::What?
0:42:17.280000 - 0:42:18.760000::Put gifts in life experience.
0:42:18.760000 - 0:42:19.760000::And where did I work?
0:42:20.400000 - 0:42:22.080000::Oh, fuck.
0:42:22.240000 - 0:42:23.920000::I worked at a goddamn deli.
0:42:24.840000 - 0:42:25.320000::Me too.
0:42:25.320000 - 0:42:26.040000::As did I.
0:42:26.040000 - 0:42:26.640000::You know, I did.
0:42:26.640000 - 0:42:27.160000::It's wrong.
0:42:27.360000 - 0:42:28.120000::Corn beef.
0:42:29.800000 - 0:42:33.840000::Rubens on rye with pickle and coleslaw.
0:42:34.680000 - 0:42:34.880000::Hmm.
0:42:35.920000 - 0:42:36.720000::And I have dreams.
0:42:36.720000 - 0:42:39.920000::I actually had a dream last night that I was back at the fucking deli.
0:42:41.240000 - 0:42:45.560000::And somebody and I have this recurring dream that I go back to the deli and the menus all changed.
0:42:45.800000 - 0:42:46.160000::Yeah.

0:43:03.120000 - 0:43:05.600000::She was, I mean, I don't want to die.
0:43:05.600000 - 0:43:06.640000::But Jody, I'm blessed.
0:43:06.640000 - 0:43:08.040000::There's no way Jody listens to this.
0:43:08.040000 - 0:43:10.320000::But Jody was very mean.
0:43:11.080000 - 0:43:12.760000::And I was very afraid of Jody.
0:43:12.960000 - 0:43:13.960000::Well, you gotta be mean.
0:43:13.960000 - 0:43:14.800000::I'm using her real.
0:43:14.800000 - 0:43:17.400000::And I would walk in like, Oh, please don't.
0:43:17.400000 - 0:43:20.200000::I would literally I was telling the story to people on say, I should I.
0:43:20.760000 - 0:43:25.200000::I would count my drawer at the end of the night, you know, because I was a cashier.
0:43:25.240000 - 0:43:28.400000::And I would be like shaking with nerves because I always fucked it up.
0:43:28.720000 - 0:43:32.280000::I always like literally was always off something.
0:43:32.520000 - 0:43:36.440000::And sometimes I would like figured out and I would put some of my tips back in.
0:43:36.440000 - 0:43:36.960000::You know what I mean?
0:43:36.960000 - 0:43:39.600000::Like just to you and out because I helped it up so badly.
0:43:40.400000 - 0:43:40.880000::It was bad.
0:43:40.880000 - 0:43:42.680000::I was a dumb as fuck worker.
0:43:42.680000 - 0:43:45.760000::Oh, one time I gave away $30 worth of coleslaw in accident.
0:43:46.400000 - 0:43:46.960000::I guess what?
0:43:46.960000 - 0:43:47.920000::Dude, that's nothing.
0:43:48.240000 - 0:43:50.840000::You want to talk about bad bosses?
0:43:51.720000 - 0:43:52.040000::Yeah.
0:43:52.040000 - 0:43:53.600000::This is amazing.
0:43:53.600000 - 0:43:54.640000::And I will shout this.
0:43:54.680000 - 0:43:58.200000::These people out because this is just too crazy that you should be able to you should
0:43:58.200000 - 0:43:59.560000::Google it if you want a little laugh.
0:44:00 - 0:44:05.240000::So this diner I was working at was called the 11 city diner, a delicatessen.
0:44:06.840000 - 0:44:09.280000::And it's owned by a man named Bradley Rubin.
0:44:09.800000 - 0:44:16.280000::And if you look at the Yelp reviews, this is the perhaps meanest person on the planet.
0:44:16.960000 - 0:44:24.760000::And just to give you a little bit of the culture, like we would have to scream hot soup instead of corner.
0:44:26.480000 - 0:44:30.040000::If you didn't scream at the top of your lungs, you would get in trouble.
0:44:30.520000 - 0:44:37.360000::And if you look at the Yelp reviews, it's stuff that's like, we had a no joiner policy.
0:44:37.360000 - 0:44:39.680000::So your whole party has to be there before you can sit down.
0:44:40.640000 - 0:44:46.080000::And so somebody is like trying to have a seat and the Yelp reviews,
0:44:46.080000 - 0:44:54.240000::like the owner of this restaurant came and cursed out my father who recently got out of surgery for lung cancer
0:44:54.440000 - 0:44:55.760000::and was asking to have a seat.
0:44:56 - 0:44:59.920000::He pushed him outside and got there's CCTV footage of him.

0:45:00 - 0:45:09.600000::fighting my dad. It's like my child was denied a high chair because the owner called him too fat to fit in it.
0:45:09.600000 - 0:45:18.960000::It was like so and people would be complaining because this owner would be screaming at the cooks so crazy that you could hear it in the restaurant.
0:45:18.960000 - 0:45:24.960000::People are like worried that there's basically professional domestic violence going on.
0:45:24.960000 - 0:45:31.360000::So that job was awesome. It was hella fun every day. It was a positive work environment and guess what?
0:45:31.360000 - 0:45:37.120000::What? How did it end? I'll tell you how it ended. I showed up to work one day. There was two locations.
0:45:37.120000 - 0:45:43.200000::There's still one in the South Loop. But the one that was in Lincoln Park. I showed up to work. It was boarded shut.
0:45:43.200000 - 0:45:51.680000::No, no, no, no warning closed the rest of the line. They just lame. They fought tooth and nail to not let people get unemployment insurance.
0:45:51.680000 - 0:45:59.280000::So shout out to Bradley Rubin at the 11th City Diner. Damn it. For being some real Chicago bastards.
0:45:59.280000 - 0:46:04.960000::But if damn if the corn beef and pastrami wasn't good, I'll tell you that it is fucking. It's fine.
0:46:04.960000 - 0:46:09.520000::Damn, I'm kind of hungry. Oh, Eric, before you go to the airport. What?
0:46:09.520000 - 0:46:13.440000::Go get a number 43 at the 11th City Diner. I wish I could get on.
0:46:13.520000 - 0:46:19.680000::Corn beef and a lot of cut and onion strings and sour cream on a hollow roll.
0:46:19.680000 - 0:46:23.680000::Don't tell my and guess what? It's only $3,000. Fucking bastards.
0:46:23.680000 - 0:46:28.800000::Oh my God. I used to work at the goddess and the grocer in Chicago and guess what?
0:46:28.800000 - 0:46:34.640000::They turned mild location into a ragged bone. You know, ragged bone. That's a clothing store.
