0:00:10.640000 - 0:00:11.640000::Oh no, I knew it.

0:01:18 - 0:01:23::If you go that hard on the first line of the song.
0:01:23 - 0:01:24::I would go that the whole...
0:01:24 - 0:01:25::I would go even harder.
0:01:25 - 0:01:26::I know.
0:01:26 - 0:01:27::It's like...
0:01:27 - 0:01:29::You feel like a 40-minute wrong reaction.
0:01:29 - 0:01:30::I forgot the lyrics actually.
0:01:30 - 0:01:32::Like I was like kind of so in and stuff.
0:01:32 - 0:01:33::I was like, what's the next line?
0:01:33 - 0:01:34::What is the next line after that?
0:01:34 - 0:01:35::Give me a good.
0:01:35 - 0:01:36::By the dawn.
0:01:36 - 0:01:37::By the dawn.
0:01:37 - 0:01:38::Wait, wait.
0:01:38 - 0:01:39::Oh, say it.
0:01:39 - 0:01:40::You see.
0:01:40 - 0:01:43::By the dawn.
0:01:43 - 0:01:50::I feel like I'm not in the same room.
0:01:50 - 0:02:05::I think it's shotgun by the way we are in a hotel room.
0:02:05 - 0:02:06::Oh yeah, we're in a new live.
0:02:06 - 0:02:07::This is the first...
0:02:07 - 0:02:10::You wonder why the energy is so electric.
0:02:10 - 0:02:11::The first ever...
0:02:11 - 0:02:17::Joy-todd Joy-todd...
0:02:17 - 0:02:24::Ticks in person...
0:02:24 - 0:02:26::And we're in Atlantic City.
0:02:26 - 0:02:28::We can be returning off right now.
0:02:28 - 0:02:31::Well, if you didn't get out with it in the first bit...
0:02:31 - 0:02:33::We can see that in the analytics.
0:02:33 - 0:02:34::There is our studies.
0:02:34 - 0:02:37::This truck is about to floor it straight into the ocean.
0:02:37 - 0:02:38::Oh my God.
0:02:38 - 0:02:42::We are in a hotel room right now in Atlantic City.
0:02:42 - 0:02:45::If you are watching the video version...
0:02:45 - 0:02:51::We have the most gorgeous background of the ocean waves pouring into the sandy beach.
0:02:51 - 0:02:52::The ocean waves.
0:02:52 - 0:02:53::The Atlantic City.
0:02:53 - 0:02:58::And this is kind of setting our mood in our brain states in a different type of pattern.
0:02:58 - 0:02:59::You know what I'm saying?
0:02:59 - 0:03:02::Can I just say that I was so fucking...
0:03:02 - 0:03:04::Like we were setting the mics up for so long.
0:03:04 - 0:03:07::It was difficult setting this up technically.
0:03:07 - 0:03:09::And I was so tired as I was about to fall asleep.
0:03:09 - 0:03:11::Right as we started the podcast.
0:03:11 - 0:03:13::My energy, I'm not kidding you.
0:03:13 - 0:03:14::It's out of 12.
0:03:14 - 0:03:15::Wow.
0:03:15 - 0:03:16::It's out of like...
0:03:16 - 0:03:17::I don't need to add five.
0:03:17 - 0:03:21::Because you know what gives you energy is entertaining people and giving people...
0:03:21 - 0:03:22::Responsibility.
0:03:22 - 0:03:23::Yeah, that's right.
0:03:23 - 0:03:26::And there's someone about that one word in podcast mode.
0:03:26 - 0:03:28::We become a different...
0:03:28 - 0:03:30::More different versions of ourselves.
0:03:30 - 0:03:33::It's like our little superhero alter ego.
0:03:33 - 0:03:34::It's like alter ego.
0:03:34 - 0:03:36::We should all say, what are we like...
0:03:36 - 0:03:38::Like off the pod and on the pod.
0:03:38 - 0:03:40::Off the pod, I'm pretty stoic.
0:03:40 - 0:03:41::And...
0:03:41 - 0:03:42::I'm nervous.
0:03:42 - 0:03:44::I don't talk about my emotions that much.
0:03:44 - 0:03:46::Or like what I'm nervous about to my friends.
0:03:46 - 0:03:47::Right.
0:03:47 - 0:03:50::And I work out and keep to myself on the podcast.
0:03:50 - 0:03:53::Whatever. I want to hear everybody's opinions and I like talking.
0:03:53 - 0:03:54::What about you guys?
0:03:54 - 0:03:55::Yeah, I don't know.
0:03:55 - 0:03:57::I guess off the pod, I'm like...
0:03:57 - 0:04:02::...interested in just gathering as much knowledge as I possibly can.
0:04:02 - 0:04:05::And experiencing human life kind of...
0:04:05 - 0:04:07::As a bystander, really.
0:04:07 - 0:04:09::I don't want to be a main character.
0:04:09 - 0:04:11::I don't want to be nuts. I just want to be dust in the wind.
0:04:11 - 0:04:15::And then I come onto this pod and I do what I'm doing is I'm living storytelling.
0:04:15 - 0:04:18::But in the real life, I'm just thinking about...
0:04:18 - 0:04:20::...who made the pyramids.
0:04:20 - 0:04:21::Right.
0:04:21 - 0:04:22::I was saying...
0:04:22 - 0:04:23::I was saying...
0:04:23 - 0:04:24::I was saying...
0:04:24 - 0:04:27::My persona off the pod and on the pod are...
0:04:27 - 0:04:29::...the exact same.
0:04:29 - 0:04:32::Because I never change for anybody.
0:04:32 - 0:04:33::Right.
0:04:33 - 0:04:34::And I'm kidding there.
0:04:34 - 0:04:36::I would say I'm very like...
0:04:36 - 0:04:42::I'm more of a reserved person in IRL when I'm off stage when I'm not in...
0:04:42 - 0:04:44::...an entertainment mode.
0:04:44 - 0:04:46::I think I'm a little quieter.
0:04:46 - 0:04:47::You guys...
0:04:47 - 0:04:48::You actually can't...
0:04:48 - 0:04:49::Here's the thing though.
0:04:49 - 0:04:50::There's no people are shot in that.
0:04:50 - 0:04:51::You're silent, but deadly.
0:04:51 - 0:04:52::Silent, yes. Like a fart.
0:04:52 - 0:04:55::You know, I'm joking because that's a fart turn.
0:04:55 - 0:04:57::I'm going to say like that.
0:04:57 - 0:04:59::And I'm seeing a new...

0:05:00 - 0:05:03::way of suicide right now live on the beach.
0:05:03 - 0:05:06.120000::There's a truck parked facing the ocean,
0:05:06.120000 - 0:05:08.960000::and I'm thinking, are they about to just gun it into the ocean
0:05:08.960000 - 0:05:10.200000::and this is the way they're going out
0:05:10.200000 - 0:05:13.760000::is by flooring it in the Chevy in the forerunner?
0:05:13.760000 - 0:05:14.760000::Straight into the water.
0:05:14.760000 - 0:05:16.080000::Now the way to go.
0:05:16.080000 - 0:05:17.720000::A beautiful way to go.
0:05:17.720000 - 0:05:21::Have we talked about how we would like to die?
0:05:21 - 0:05:22::I think we have.
0:05:22 - 0:05:23::We have.
0:05:23 - 0:05:24.480000::We've talked about how we'd like to die,
0:05:24.480000 - 0:05:26.160000::but we could go into it again on a podcast.
0:05:26.160000 - 0:05:27.600000::Well, let's talk about, hey, hey,
0:05:27.600000 - 0:05:29.880000::let's talk about how we'd like to be born.
0:05:29.880000 - 0:05:32.360000::Would you want to be born into a tub?
0:05:32.360000 - 0:05:34.560000::Do you want to be born in a dirty ass hospital?
0:05:34.560000 - 0:05:35.560000::No.
0:05:35.560000 - 0:05:36.400000::No.
0:05:36.400000 - 0:05:38.360000::Do you want to be born publicly in front
0:05:38.360000 - 0:05:41::at like a born straight onto a fucking stage
0:05:41 - 0:05:43.840000::and everyone's, that's how people should be born.
0:05:43.840000 - 0:05:45.280000::Let me tell you about this.
0:05:45.280000 - 0:05:48.160000::Have you ever seen that elephant birth video
0:05:48.160000 - 0:05:49::that I've seen before?
0:05:49 - 0:05:49.840000::Which one?
0:05:49.840000 - 0:05:50.680000::I've seen them all.
0:05:50.680000 - 0:05:52.600000::There's this video of this elephant giving birth
0:05:52.600000 - 0:05:53.760000::as mama at a zoo.
0:05:53.760000 - 0:05:55.200000::Is it incredibly wet?
0:05:55.200000 - 0:05:56.040000::Like the wet?
0:05:56.040000 - 0:05:57.880000::It is so fucking like this.
0:05:57.880000 - 0:05:58.840000::Like the next level wet.
0:05:58.840000 - 0:06:00.640000::I mean, it's gallons of liquid coming out.
0:06:00.640000 - 0:06:01.480000::Yeah, yeah.
0:06:01.480000 - 0:06:02.320000::Oh my God.
0:06:02.320000 - 0:06:04.120000::The elephant.
0:06:04.120000 - 0:06:05.120000::It's crazy.
0:06:05.120000 - 0:06:09.040000::It's like the shining elevator doors opening a little bit,
0:06:09.040000 - 0:06:12.160000::but it's the birth canal inside of an elephant.
0:06:12.160000 - 0:06:14.560000::And what happens is these baby elephants
0:06:14.560000 - 0:06:17.720000::are born at like 400 pounds and like this, right?
0:06:17.720000 - 0:06:18.520000::They're not babies.
0:06:18.520000 - 0:06:19.360000::They're not babies.
0:06:19.360000 - 0:06:20.200000::They're full of them.
0:06:20.200000 - 0:06:22.640000::Humans stay in the womb too short.
0:06:22.640000 - 0:06:23.600000::Do you know that?
0:06:23.600000 - 0:06:24.440000::Too short.
0:06:24.440000 - 0:06:25.280000::We should be in that long.
0:06:25.280000 - 0:06:27.040000::That's why babies are so fucking useless
0:06:27.040000 - 0:06:29.920000::because most mammals, they drop up out the horses,
0:06:29.920000 - 0:06:32.640000::they drop up out the P word and then they are ready to go.
0:06:32.640000 - 0:06:34.720000::Well, elephants are similar to us in that way
0:06:34.720000 - 0:06:37.320000::that they are the skin.
0:06:37.320000 - 0:06:38.960000::No, no, no, no, they are.
0:06:38.960000 - 0:06:40.040000::They are memory raised.
0:06:40.040000 - 0:06:42.920000::No, can I just fucking talk for a second?
0:06:42.920000 - 0:06:44.880000::All right, man.
0:06:44.880000 - 0:06:46.760000::Yeah, just go for it.
0:06:46.760000 - 0:06:52.360000::Elephants are raised by their parents.
0:06:52.360000 - 0:06:53.880000::They don't go off by themselves.
0:06:53.880000 - 0:06:56.120000::Like, you know, it takes us 20 years to go off.
0:06:56.160000 - 0:06:58.280000::We get raised by our parents, what are you about?
0:06:58.280000 - 0:07:00.440000::No, no, we, you didn't get raised by your parents?
0:07:00.440000 - 0:07:02.200000::No, no, they're the same.
0:07:02.200000 - 0:07:06.240000::Like as us, like they spend like maybe 15 years being,
0:07:06.240000 - 0:07:08.400000::like with their parents, on their own.
0:07:08.400000 - 0:07:11::Oh, those mammals are like, they go off
0:07:11 - 0:07:11.840000::through their own shoes.
0:07:11.840000 - 0:07:13.840000::They're just like, okay, I'm fucking on having a kid
0:07:13.840000 - 0:07:16.680000::and then I'm just like away from my parents.
0:07:16.680000 - 0:07:19.240000::How long does an elephant live?
0:07:19.240000 - 0:07:20.400000::Oh, 80 years.
0:07:20.400000 - 0:07:21.240000::Really?
0:07:21.240000 - 0:07:22.400000::Or something like that.
0:07:22.400000 - 0:07:23.240000::So there's, I don't know.
0:07:23.240000 - 0:07:24.080000::I don't know.
0:07:24.080000 - 0:07:27.840000::People listening to this that are like using our knowledge
0:07:27.840000 - 0:07:30.400000::as like, oh, you know how you listen to a podcast?
0:07:30.400000 - 0:07:32.240000::You're like, I heard something on a podcast
0:07:32.240000 - 0:07:33.960000::and like they said this fact.
0:07:33.960000 - 0:07:36.640000::Well, you could trust 90% of what we say, but,
0:07:36.640000 - 0:07:38.920000::but 10% is a gregiously wrong.
0:07:38.920000 - 0:07:40.800000::But oh, but let me finish what I was saying about the elephant
0:07:40.800000 - 0:07:41.640000::bird.
0:07:41.640000 - 0:07:42.480000::Oh, yes, yes.
0:07:42.480000 - 0:07:43.640000::So what happens in this bird story,
0:07:43.640000 - 0:07:45.640000::it's like, it's like, it moves you to tears almost
0:07:45.640000 - 0:07:48.480000::and also makes you not shits and so gross.
0:07:48.480000 - 0:07:52.080000::The amniotic sac, it's supposed to break when it hits the ground.
0:07:52.080000 - 0:07:53.080000::You see what I'm saying?
0:07:53.080000 - 0:07:55.320000::It's supposed to go quick and it's supposed to.
0:07:55.320000 - 0:07:57.200000::So otherwise you'll be stuck in the sac.
0:07:57.200000 - 0:07:58.040000::Right.
0:07:58.040000 - 0:08:02.360000::But it's broken and the elephant is stuck inside of the sac.
0:08:02.360000 - 0:08:04.320000::And so the mama has to break it.
0:08:04.320000 - 0:08:05.160000::Yeah.
0:08:05.160000 - 0:08:07.960000::And then the baby elephants lie in there not breathing.
0:08:07.960000 - 0:08:09.680000::Because it's suffocating in the sac.
0:08:09.680000 - 0:08:11::Because I think something had been wrapped on it.
0:08:11 - 0:08:13.080000::Neck or something, it's not breathing, whatever.
0:08:13.080000 - 0:08:16.720000::And you hear the zoologist, whatever the zookeepers,
0:08:16.720000 - 0:08:18.520000::who I think are modern criminals.
0:08:18.520000 - 0:08:22.400000::They're standing around and they are going, oh,
0:08:22.400000 - 0:08:23.680000::but they can't do anything.
0:08:23.680000 - 0:08:25::It's up to the mama.
0:08:25 - 0:08:26.480000::And so the mama, why can they not do anything?
0:08:26.480000 - 0:08:28.120000::Because there's nothing you can really do for the,
0:08:28.120000 - 0:08:31.160000::you can't like give a CPR to a, oh, I see what you're saying.
0:08:31.160000 - 0:08:34.480000::And so what the mama starts doing is it starts smacking.
0:08:34.480000 - 0:08:36.760000::Oh, I have to see if it's all around.
0:08:36.760000 - 0:08:38.920000::And it's starting to start going, trying to get the lung,
0:08:38.920000 - 0:08:40.680000::the flu that it lungs.
0:08:40.680000 - 0:08:43.960000::And it's so fucking crazy, it gets smacked all around.
0:08:43.960000 - 0:08:47.120000::And then all of a sudden, you see,
0:08:47.120000 - 0:08:49.040000::and elephants are born with a,
0:08:49.040000 - 0:08:51.160000::it's like they have a born with the nears.
0:08:51.160000 - 0:08:53.840000::And you see a breathing like this.
0:08:53.840000 - 0:08:54.600000::Open it, it's my home.
0:08:54.600000 - 0:08:55.880000::Oh my God.
0:08:55.880000 - 0:08:58.440000::You're not like a baby with a full set of teeth to freak you out.
0:08:58.440000 - 0:08:59.960000::And it's fully born and breathing.
0:08:59.960000 - 0:09:01.080000::And then it gets up on his legs.
0:09:01.080000 - 0:09:06.400000::And it's like, oh my God, that's life fighting to exist.
0:09:06.400000 - 0:09:08.800000::And that's a life that almost didn't make it.
0:09:08.800000 - 0:09:10.280000::But you want to talk about trauma.
0:09:10.280000 - 0:09:12::Imagine being born in the first thing that happens
0:09:12 - 0:09:14::is your mom starts to meet and shit out.
0:09:14 - 0:09:15.360000::Right.
0:09:15.360000 - 0:09:17::That's some of y'all need to be born like.
0:09:17 - 0:09:17.840000::Right.
0:09:17.840000 - 0:09:20.480000::It's something that needs to be an attitude adjustments.
0:09:20.480000 - 0:09:23.280000::Some of you guys need to be slapped the fuck around a little bit.
0:09:23.280000 - 0:09:24.920000::I know, I'm about to put you up.
0:09:24.920000 - 0:09:27.400000::I feel like putting something all back into my sack right now
0:09:27.400000 - 0:09:29.480000::and popping you back out, smacking.
0:09:29.480000 - 0:09:31.440000::And people really need to be reborn.
0:09:31.440000 - 0:09:33.880000::Speaking of attitude and being reborn,
0:09:33.880000 - 0:09:36.080000::we don't want to give too much of a way about Atlantic City
0:09:36.080000 - 0:09:37.840000::because we have a whole chronicle coming out
0:09:37.840000 - 0:09:39::about our time here.
0:09:39 - 0:09:39.840000::The chronic what?
0:09:39.840000 - 0:09:43.240000::But because of Atlantic City, the chronic what?
0:09:43.240000 - 0:09:44.680000::Oh, all right.
0:09:44.680000 - 0:09:46.920000::We're kind of the next lonely island in a way.
0:09:46.920000 - 0:09:48.960000::You know, well, you guys, yeah.
0:09:48.960000 - 0:09:52::We're the opposite verse.
0:09:52 - 0:09:54.440000::We are the what's the opposite alone?
0:09:54.440000 - 0:09:55.440000::Togetherness.
0:09:55.440000 - 0:09:58.360000::Being together feeling the fulfilled island.
0:09:58.360000 - 0:10:00.040000::Like the socially fulfilled.

0:10:00 - 0:10:01.520000::socially fulfilled land.
0:10:01.520000 - 0:10:02.520000::Content.
0:10:02.520000 - 0:10:03.520000::Socially.
0:10:03.520000 - 0:10:05.760000::All right, but what I always, what I was saying,
0:10:05.760000 - 0:10:07.840000::speaking at Linux City and speaking about being rude
0:10:07.840000 - 0:10:09.680000::and people need to be being airborne,
0:10:09.680000 - 0:10:11.520000::people here, some of the people here
0:10:11.520000 - 0:10:12.920000::need to attitude adjustment.
0:10:12.920000 - 0:10:13.760000::Good.
0:10:13.760000 - 0:10:18.240000::I mean, I'm like, you were surrounded by food, saltwater,
0:10:18.240000 - 0:10:21.240000::sea air, gambling, beautiful people.
0:10:21.240000 - 0:10:22.080000::Out of the hall.
0:10:22.080000 - 0:10:25.080000::Where do you get drugs easily?
0:10:25.080000 - 0:10:26.440000::You can do illegal things.
0:10:26.440000 - 0:10:27.480000::You could probably kill somebody
0:10:27.480000 - 0:10:29.280000::who's way easier here than I was saying.
0:10:29.280000 - 0:10:30.720000::You can't just knock them out.
0:10:30.720000 - 0:10:32.680000::And they won't even be mad at you when they wake up
0:10:32.680000 - 0:10:33.560000::or in the next life.
0:10:33.560000 - 0:10:35.680000::They'll be like, I get it, we were in the AC.
0:10:35.680000 - 0:10:37.200000::I would have, I would be like,
0:10:37.200000 - 0:10:40.320000::if I died in in Atlantic City, I would be like, yeah.
0:10:40.320000 - 0:10:42.320000::Like, I'm not going to be mad about that.
0:10:42.320000 - 0:10:44.440000::Well, imagine the, the spirits,
0:10:44.440000 - 0:10:46.400000::the spirits that you'd get to chill with.
0:10:46.400000 - 0:10:47.440000::There's probably some wonderful,
0:10:47.440000 - 0:10:49.960000::wonderfully entertaining people who have passed here.
0:10:49.960000 - 0:10:50.960000::Oh, the ghost.
0:10:50.960000 - 0:10:52.920000::Because of certain being a ghost in Atlantic City,
0:10:52.920000 - 0:10:55.240000::haunting the gambling table.
0:10:55.240000 - 0:10:56.080000::Ghosts, practically.
0:10:56.080000 - 0:10:57.240000::Being a sexual ghost.
0:10:57.240000 - 0:10:58.640000::That's called a succubus.
0:10:58.640000 - 0:10:59.480000::That's called a succubus.
0:10:59.480000 - 0:11:00.560000::Oh, that is a succubus.
0:11:00.560000 - 0:11:01.840000::Well, there's a lot of succubus.
0:11:01.840000 - 0:11:04.680000::I think there's a lot of succubus here.
0:11:04.680000 - 0:11:07.360000::Do you hear about people who have paranormal experiences
0:11:07.360000 - 0:11:09.360000::and they're like, I get like, fuck by ghosts.
0:11:09.360000 - 0:11:11.040000::They're like, a ghost has sex with me.
0:11:11.040000 - 0:11:11.880000::Yeah.
0:11:11.880000 - 0:11:14.160000::And like, they like have like kind of a sexual relationship
0:11:14.160000 - 0:11:15::with a ghost.
0:11:15 - 0:11:15.840000::Yeah.
0:11:15.840000 - 0:11:16.720000::And I'm like, I want to,
0:11:16.720000 - 0:11:20.440000::why are no paranormal things coming into my life?
0:11:20.440000 - 0:11:24.240000::Like, I'm begging the universe to be adopted.
0:11:24.240000 - 0:11:25.080000::Right.
0:11:25.080000 - 0:11:28.160000::For a ghost to come and just like,
0:11:28.160000 - 0:11:30.920000::just get on top with me and ride.
0:11:30.920000 - 0:11:33.680000::And let me ride them.
0:11:33.680000 - 0:11:34.520000::They ride me.
0:11:34.520000 - 0:11:36.560000::Whatever, dude, I'm down for anything.
0:11:36.560000 - 0:11:37.800000::Like, I just want to put that out there
0:11:37.800000 - 0:11:39::to the paranormal.
0:11:39 - 0:11:39.840000::Yeah.
0:11:39.840000 - 0:11:41.840000::You know, like, you know, ghosts out there.
0:11:41.840000 - 0:11:43.240000::Let me just say this though.
0:11:43.240000 - 0:11:45.320000::Be careful what you were for.
0:11:45.320000 - 0:11:47.960000::Because your life is pretty good, man.
0:11:47.960000 - 0:11:50.520000::I'll just say it's pretty good as is.
0:11:50.520000 - 0:11:52.480000::And if you look hard enough, guess what?
0:11:52.480000 - 0:11:53.560000::You'll find it, man.
0:11:53.560000 - 0:11:56.040000::And what you'll find is not going to be cheer-like.
0:11:56.040000 - 0:11:57.280000::There's darkness there.
0:11:57.280000 - 0:12:00.320000::Not everybody is enemies with ghosts.
0:12:00.320000 - 0:12:03.760000::I feel like you and your background is particularly,
0:12:03.760000 - 0:12:06.960000::it makes you particularly susceptible to ghost hate.
0:12:06.960000 - 0:12:07.920000::But a lot of people.
0:12:07.920000 - 0:12:08.920000::A lot of people.
0:12:08.920000 - 0:12:09.920000::A lot of people.
0:12:09.920000 - 0:12:11.760000::Well, would you think that's a coincidence?
0:12:11.760000 - 0:12:12.920000::I don't think it's a coincidence.
0:12:12.920000 - 0:12:15.560000::And I feel guilty every day for all the death of my life.
0:12:15.560000 - 0:12:16.880000::But there's nothing I can do about it.
0:12:16.880000 - 0:12:19.160000::So I've got to just live and hang out with my friends.
0:12:19.160000 - 0:12:20.160000::But you had to,
0:12:20.160000 - 0:12:21.680000::don't need y'all bringing it up to me all the time.
0:12:21.680000 - 0:12:22.400000::It's not about you.
0:12:22.400000 - 0:12:23.560000::You brought it up, man.
0:12:23.560000 - 0:12:25.560000::We're talking about nature-related.
0:12:25.560000 - 0:12:28.520000::Nate wants to hear a ghost, and you're making it about you again.
0:12:28.520000 - 0:12:31.200000::I think if you fucked a ghost, that would be rewarding.
0:12:31.200000 - 0:12:32.520000::And I think they'd like to.
0:12:32.520000 - 0:12:36.640000::I don't think a ghost in a way that that would make them
0:12:36.640000 - 0:12:38.400000::pass on to the different.
0:12:38.400000 - 0:12:40.320000::You know, I feel like they need to get like
0:12:40.320000 - 0:12:42.840000::fucked a certain way, and then they can go to hell.
0:12:42.840000 - 0:12:43.640000::Wait, wait, wait.
0:12:43.640000 - 0:12:45.840000::I have an amazing idea for a short film.
0:12:45.840000 - 0:12:47.480000::Where you start having sex with a ghost.
0:12:47.480000 - 0:12:48.480000::Oh, we're talking short film.
0:12:48.480000 - 0:12:49.560000::With a succubus.
0:12:49.560000 - 0:12:51.400000::And they're all transparent, black, and white,
0:12:51.400000 - 0:12:53.960000::Victorian type of succubus.
0:12:53.960000 - 0:12:55.400000::And you have sex with them a couple of times.
0:12:55.400000 - 0:12:56.640000::But then you start to get to know them,
0:12:56.640000 - 0:12:58::and you don't just want to f them.
0:12:58 - 0:12:59.120000::You want to get to know them.
0:12:59.120000 - 0:12:59.960000::This is a movie already.
0:12:59.960000 - 0:13:02.800000::And as you're, well, I don't think this has happened though.
0:13:02.800000 - 0:13:06.240000::As you're having SES with them, slowly over time,
0:13:06.240000 - 0:13:09.280000::as you develop relationship, the color starts
0:13:09.280000 - 0:13:12.720000::going back into their body, and they become less transparent,
0:13:12.720000 - 0:13:15.720000::and they become solid, and they become alive again.
0:13:15.720000 - 0:13:18.120000::And then right when they're fully alive, just as you said,
0:13:18.960000 - 0:13:20.720000::the door to somebody opens the door.
0:13:20.720000 - 0:13:21.920000::Or God opens the door.
0:13:21.920000 - 0:13:24.600000::Before that, when they become actually real,
0:13:24.600000 - 0:13:27.960000::they are exposed to other life forms.
0:13:27.960000 - 0:13:31.040000::And they say, oh, I didn't want to fuck you Nate,
0:13:31.040000 - 0:13:32.440000::because you're like just,
0:13:32.440000 - 0:13:35.760000::Oh, so they would dump me and go with some hells.
0:13:35.760000 - 0:13:37.720000::Why, like my brother or my best friend,
0:13:37.720000 - 0:13:38.560000::or something like that.
0:13:38.560000 - 0:13:39.960000::You don't got a brother.
0:13:39.960000 - 0:13:41.160000::I know, they know a movie.
0:13:41.160000 - 0:13:42::They know a movie.
0:13:42 - 0:13:43.080000::You can have brothers and shit.
0:13:43.080000 - 0:13:43.920000::It's fictional.
0:13:43.920000 - 0:13:44.760000::It's like that.
0:13:44.760000 - 0:13:45.600000::It's kind of crazy.
0:13:45.600000 - 0:13:46.680000::You can get with narrative.
0:13:46.680000 - 0:13:47.760000::You could go fictional with it.
0:13:48.680000 - 0:13:49.520000::For sure.
0:13:49.520000 - 0:13:52.320000::Well, that's when you send them back to the underworld.
0:13:52.320000 - 0:13:53.720000::Oh, I brought you back.
0:13:53.720000 - 0:13:54.560000::I'm taking back.
0:13:54.560000 - 0:13:55.560000::That isn't Oscar.
0:13:55.560000 - 0:13:57.560000::But isn't this a Reese Witherspoon movie?
0:13:57.560000 - 0:13:58.080000::Probably.
0:13:58.080000 - 0:13:59.440000::Where she's dead and Paul Rudder.
0:13:59.440000 - 0:14:01.160000::Somebody has to, like, it's not Paul Rudder,
0:14:01.160000 - 0:14:02.960000::but somebody like that who has to,
0:14:02.960000 - 0:14:04.960000::who falls in love with her, but she's dead.
0:14:04.960000 - 0:14:06.040000::And then everyone's looking at her,
0:14:06.040000 - 0:14:07.080000::look at him.
0:14:07.080000 - 0:14:08::Just watch this.
0:14:08 - 0:14:08.840000::What is it?
0:14:08.840000 - 0:14:13.640000::Reese Witherspoon and it is Mark Ruffalo, and she's dead.
0:14:13.640000 - 0:14:14.680000::Or no, she's actually not dead.
0:14:14.680000 - 0:14:16.320000::She's in a coma.
0:14:16.320000 - 0:14:16.840000::Right.
0:14:16.840000 - 0:14:19.480000::She's in a coma, but her spear is wandering around going
0:14:19.480000 - 0:14:20.560000::on dates with the sea.
0:14:20.560000 - 0:14:21.560000::Right.
0:14:21.560000 - 0:14:23.320000::And then she comes back from her life.
0:14:23.320000 - 0:14:24.600000::But she doesn't remember him.
0:14:24.600000 - 0:14:25.800000::All right, it's already been made.

0:23:14.540000 - 0:23:16.340000::We'll work on it in the next episode.
0:23:16.340000 - 0:23:17.180000::I'll body it.
0:23:17.180000 - 0:23:17.940000::You know what's funny?
0:23:17.940000 - 0:23:20.380000::We shouldn't be doing impressions of politicians.
0:23:20.380000 - 0:23:22.540000::We should be respecting the fuck out of the way.
0:23:22.540000 - 0:23:23.380000::Right.
0:23:23.380000 - 0:23:25.100000::Because impressions of anybody regardless
0:23:25.100000 - 0:23:28.500000::of what they've done is so fucking disrespectful.
0:23:28.500000 - 0:23:31.340000::And to see these things done on major network shows,
0:23:31.340000 - 0:23:33.260000::I won't even name them, but major sketch shows
0:23:33.260000 - 0:23:34.700000::that are on the networks.
0:23:34.700000 - 0:23:37.140000::I'm like, do you all realize the damage,
0:23:37.140000 - 0:23:38.460000::the mental damage that you're doing
0:23:38.460000 - 0:23:40.180000::to the people you're impressed with?
0:23:40.180000 - 0:23:41.180000::Brutally.
0:23:41.180000 - 0:23:42.180000::Brutally impressed.
0:23:42.180000 - 0:23:43.980000::Can I just say that at one point?
0:23:43.980000 - 0:23:46.220000::At one point in my career, I think there will be,
0:23:46.220000 - 0:23:48.180000::you know, people doing impressions of me.
0:23:48.180000 - 0:23:49.020000::Of course.
0:23:49.020000 - 0:23:51.060000::And there will be that fun moment, you know, on SNL
0:23:51.100000 - 0:23:54.300000::when I'm hosting and then the young end
0:23:54.300000 - 0:23:55.620000::is doing an impression of me.
0:23:55.620000 - 0:23:57.260000::And I come on as me.
0:23:57.260000 - 0:23:59.060000::And we're both talking, we're both two versions
0:23:59.060000 - 0:24:00.140000::of Nate Brown.
0:24:00.140000 - 0:24:02.020000::I am going to smack.
0:24:02.020000 - 0:24:02.860000::I'm going to do it.
0:24:02.860000 - 0:24:04.460000::As soon as that person talks in the rehearsal,
0:24:04.460000 - 0:24:05.900000::I'll be like, play along, do the sketch.
0:24:05.900000 - 0:24:06.900000::I thought so.
0:24:06.900000 - 0:24:07.900000::I thought so.
0:24:07.900000 - 0:24:09.740000::Live tape, they do that.
0:24:09.740000 - 0:24:10.740000::Bam!
0:24:10.740000 - 0:24:11.900000::Boom!
0:24:11.900000 - 0:24:15.700000::Don't have a fucking, do that shit again, bitch.
0:24:15.700000 - 0:24:17.140000::Don't you ever do that.
0:24:17.140000 - 0:24:19.140000::I'll take the camera, I'll shake it, and I'll be like,
0:24:19.980000 - 0:24:21.780000::he's saying for own show now.
0:24:21.780000 - 0:24:23.260000::Yeah!
0:24:23.260000 - 0:24:24.100000::Oh man.
0:24:24.100000 - 0:24:24.940000::I can also say,
0:24:24.940000 - 0:24:25.940000::oh man.
0:24:25.940000 - 0:24:26.940000::Yeah.
0:24:26.940000 - 0:24:27.940000::They're going to cut to commercial.
0:24:27.940000 - 0:24:29.660000::I got to fucking somebody with a gun in the booth
0:24:29.660000 - 0:24:31.980000::and the guy said, no, I'm going to cut to commercial.
0:24:31.980000 - 0:24:32.980000::So that's how you like to say,
0:24:32.980000 - 0:24:35.180000::Exactly, revenge is you like to let him know,
0:24:35.180000 - 0:24:36.900000::let him know publicly.
0:24:36.900000 - 0:24:37.420000::Yeah.
0:24:37.420000 - 0:24:38.100000::And shame then.
0:24:38.100000 - 0:24:38.940000::Right, yeah.
0:24:38.940000 - 0:24:39.980000::You're not going to disrespect you
0:24:39.980000 - 0:24:41.100000::and just tell him you're wrong.
0:24:41.100000 - 0:24:41.940000::You're going to.
0:24:41.940000 - 0:24:43.700000::Sometimes you got to show people that you're not
0:24:43.700000 - 0:24:44.700000::to be disrespected.
0:24:44.700000 - 0:24:46.780000::And it takes one, you just got to do it once.
0:24:46.780000 - 0:24:47.620000::You got to do it.
0:24:47.780000 - 0:24:49.460000::I'm waiting for my moment to do that
0:24:49.460000 - 0:24:53.180000::because the minute I get disrespected again,
0:24:54.660000 - 0:24:56.260000::I'm going crazy.
0:24:56.260000 - 0:24:57.580000::You get disrespected.
0:24:57.580000 - 0:24:59.700000::No matter if it's a child.

0:25:00 - 0:25:03.360000::Whatever and it's gonna be with my words by the way
0:25:03.360000 - 0:25:05.600000::I don't use violence unless I get fought with him
0:25:05.600000 - 0:25:09.200000::But the words they use your words hurt more than more than your words
0:25:09.200000 - 0:25:12.960000::My words are educated my words are kind of smithed in a forge of
0:25:17.040000 - 0:25:23.280000::Well, and that's in that because words punch heals a bruise heals unless it gets to your brain
0:25:23.280000 - 0:25:25.280000::And that can kill you put a word
0:25:25.520000 - 0:25:30.080000::Bury yourself onto your skin goes into your heart. Yep, and stays there for a minute
0:25:30.480000 - 0:25:32.960000::And a word salad is not a healthy salad
0:25:33.840000 - 0:25:39.120000::There's a salad of ruthless bullets coming straight into your ego taking you out
0:25:40 - 0:25:42.800000::Yep, by the way less than for the Republicans
0:25:43.680000 - 0:25:46.400000::At the state of the union. I'm watching these Republicans and I'm like
0:25:48 - 0:25:50.800000::Just oh my god
0:25:55.280000 - 0:26:01.840000::Definitely like can see their point of view. Yeah, we're kind of those people that can dip into that of course
0:26:02.240000 - 0:26:07.680000::And that we can see we can see where they're coming from just a little bit because you need to to kind of a
0:26:08.800000 - 0:26:13.040000::Um, and understanding and have a compromise you need to understand
0:26:13.680000 - 0:26:17.600000::For the table and having understanding of here's what I think here's a two thing
0:26:17.840000 - 0:26:23.280000::Where can we meet in the middle here? Right? You know, you can't negotiate with somebody who you're trying to hit in the face
0:26:23.600000 - 0:26:28.560000::Of course not because then you just have to be a war a medal exactly and that's not what
0:26:29.120000 - 0:26:37.120000::Politics should be what do you think is missing from the political system from the Senate meetings where they're all together
0:26:37.360000 - 0:26:45.360000::Is there something that could look at food liquor and food liquor and food yeah, because Marjorie Taylor green and Joe Biden or whatever
0:26:45.440000 - 0:26:48.720000::I'm not gonna yell at each other if they both got mouthfuls of spaghetti and garlic bread
0:26:49.040000 - 0:26:50.240000::That's for sure
0:26:50.320000 - 0:26:54.480000::That's actually true the liquor might actually add to the fighting a little bit
0:26:54.720000 - 0:26:57.760000::Democrats can drink liquor, but Republicans have to stay
0:26:58.400000 - 0:26:59.200000::Right
0:26:59.200000 - 0:27:04.800000::So and that's kind of the punishment you get for being right. Yeah, you can't oh that would be my worst punishment
0:27:06.880000 - 0:27:10.160000::And I think a lot of right-wing Republicans would dip over to the other side of the
0:27:10.160000 - 0:27:14.960000::Of course they can make a lot of liquor here and they I would be a Republican for free beer
0:27:15.280000 - 0:27:19.440000::I think that they need to be put onto some type of reality TV show
0:27:19.920000 - 0:27:24.240000::where it's like oh the Democratic congressman from Alabama or
0:27:25.120000 - 0:27:30.080000::Probably not Alabama, but Delaware wherever is tied or sewn
0:27:30.960000 - 0:27:32.800000::Into the
0:27:32.800000 - 0:27:39.120000::The Republican congressman from Alabama and it's a saw style situation where they have to
0:27:40.160000 - 0:27:45.280000::They're like handcuffed to each other. I'm thinking like grotesically like sewn together the skin is like
0:27:45.280000 - 0:27:49.200000::Soss like that or horror movie style and wake up
0:27:49.840000 - 0:27:51.840000::screaming
0:27:51.840000 - 0:27:56.640000::Imagine that's gonna and so then they're gonna kind of like you're saying we that's gonna make them bond
0:27:57.440000 - 0:28:02.560000::I think so because I think like you realize that like people that fight in World War two or World War one
0:28:03.120000 - 0:28:05.120000::They came from
0:28:05.440000 - 0:28:10.080000::Disparebackers want to say sorry to all the listeners right now Eric's dipping into World War
0:28:10.320000 - 0:28:17.920000::It's fine. It's fine. We couldn't learn so many lessons from they learned the lessons so that we don't have to learn them again
0:28:18.320000 - 0:28:20.320000::And unfortunately people are forgetting history
0:28:20.560000 - 0:28:26.960000::We are but I'm saying you go you would go into a troop Democrats and Republicans were in foxholes together and they came out liber
0:28:27.760000 - 0:28:31.840000::Terri, you know, they came out some miles. It didn't matter what you know that
0:28:31.840000 - 0:28:36.080000::I don't know what the politics are when both are flying in your face and when you're catching
0:28:36.560000 - 0:28:37.560000::Uh
0:28:37.560000 - 0:28:38.240000::frag
0:28:38.240000 - 0:28:43.360000::You're not a frag in your mouth right. We are something about that. We all bleed the same
0:28:44 - 0:28:50.400000::Redway blue. That's true. Oh, you know you know our blood is blue by the way until it's oxidized. How does that work?
0:28:50.880000 - 0:28:52.880000::Look at your veins blue
0:28:52.880000 - 0:28:55.520000::Our blood actually blue is folk isn't it?
0:28:56.480000 - 0:28:59.920000::Is it red and then the filter of the yellow skin makes it look blue because
0:28:59.920000 - 0:29:04.800000::No, I don't know about that. I think that blood is blue is folk and then once it's the air it's all red
0:29:05.040000 - 0:29:07.040000::So what if it hits a different gas
0:29:07.200000 - 0:29:12.880000::Could be any other type of color. I don't know if you're yeah, if there's hello marijuana in the air will your blood come out green?
0:29:13.440000 - 0:29:15.120000::Oh my god
0:29:15.120000 - 0:29:18.640000::That was the most blood bleeding you've ever been
0:29:19.600000 - 0:29:21.600000::Oh, probably from my mouth
0:29:23.440000 - 0:29:29.120000::From a tooth probably a tooth. I got a baseball thrown in my fucking face
0:29:29.840000 - 0:29:35.760000::And it was like a fast pitch ball. I think that's why my nose has like kind of a
0:29:37.120000 - 0:29:41.840000::Reckon like different here something. I think it kind of broke my nose a little bit
0:29:41.840000 - 0:29:48.800000::But that was the most blood I'd ever seen and I'm afraid to this day of like balls like being like thrown around
0:29:49.040000 - 0:29:50.400000::Like if I'm on a b-ball court
0:29:50.480000 - 0:29:54.640000::I think that the balls gonna hit my face like it kind of traumatized me
0:29:54.800000 - 0:29:59.040000::I can tell because you don't have a lot of balls around you know any person belongings. Yeah
0:29:59.120000 - 0:30:01.120000::I'm sorry about that

0:30:00 - 0:30:03::That's how I feel about hammers.
0:30:03 - 0:30:04::Hammers?
0:30:04 - 0:30:06::What did you get hammered?
0:30:06 - 0:30:09::Well, that's a different way.
0:30:09 - 0:30:10::Oh, shit.
0:30:10 - 0:30:12::And the wine is love.
0:30:12 - 0:30:13::Basically tonight.
0:30:13 - 0:30:14::Yeah.
0:30:14 - 0:30:17::I was trying to break open a huge rock.
0:30:17 - 0:30:19::I found a rock that was bigger than you can imagine.
0:30:19 - 0:30:21::And so I thought what's going to be in there?
0:30:21 - 0:30:22::Probably some gold.
0:30:22 - 0:30:24::And so I got this hammer that was big as fuck.
0:30:24 - 0:30:26::I was probably 18, 19 years old.
0:30:26 - 0:30:28::A little too old for this.
0:30:28 - 0:30:29::And I swung the hammer back.
0:30:29 - 0:30:32::You know how the back of the hammer has two little heads on it.
0:30:32 - 0:30:33::Yeah.
0:30:33 - 0:30:34::I go whoop!
0:30:34 - 0:30:35::Into your head.
0:30:35 - 0:30:38::And I swing it up and I hit back less.
0:30:38 - 0:30:40::Oh, crack my skull open with the back of a hammer.
0:30:40 - 0:30:42::And I was bleeding.
0:30:42 - 0:30:47::I was leaking out the back of my head like a frickin' caprison.
0:30:47 - 0:30:48::Goodness.
0:30:48 - 0:30:50::But hammers only.
0:30:50 - 0:30:52::We need hammers only battlefield.
0:30:52 - 0:30:53::We need to get rid of guns.
0:30:53 - 0:30:55::Well, y'all saw what happened to Mr. P.P.
0:30:55 - 0:30:56::Who?
0:30:56 - 0:30:57::Paul Pelosi.
0:30:57 - 0:30:58::Paul Pelosi.
0:30:58 - 0:31:00::We can't go into this.
0:31:00 - 0:31:01::Well, he's brave.
0:31:01 - 0:31:02::I know.
0:31:02 - 0:31:03::He's very brave.
0:31:03 - 0:31:04::He is brave.
0:31:04 - 0:31:06::I can't go into that video.
0:31:06 - 0:31:12::Eric, if somebody was in your house with a hammer smiling at you bigger than fuckin'
0:31:12 - 0:31:14::anybody's ever smiling at you in their life.
0:31:14 - 0:31:16::And then you had the cops on the phone.
0:31:16 - 0:31:18::Can you keep your composure?
0:31:18 - 0:31:22::I think I could, I think I would get Stockholm syndrome like that.
0:31:22 - 0:31:23::I am.
0:31:23 - 0:31:24::If someone's coming in my house.
0:31:24 - 0:31:26::I would try to be their friend so quickly.
0:31:26 - 0:31:28::And I think you would achieve that.
0:31:28 - 0:31:31::I think they would be like, want to kill you and then be like, wait a second.
0:31:31 - 0:31:35::I would like to just like, maybe let's get out of the house and go, kind of like.
0:31:35 - 0:31:36::Just keep his gun.
0:31:36 - 0:31:37::Get the sandwich or something.
0:31:37 - 0:31:38::I'll be making a laugh.
0:31:38 - 0:31:39::I'm not even kidding.
0:31:39 - 0:31:40::That would be even on lose.
0:31:40 - 0:31:42::And then I would get it.
0:31:42 - 0:31:43::Yeah.
0:31:43 - 0:31:44::I'm good.
0:31:44 - 0:31:47::That would be gonna bomb when I get my chains.
0:31:47 - 0:31:48::Yeah.
0:31:48 - 0:31:49::It's interesting.
0:31:49 - 0:31:52::I like to think that I like to attack somebody if they're in my house.
0:31:52 - 0:31:56::But the one time that I woke up and I thought somebody was in my house, I tried to run out
0:31:56 - 0:31:57::the door in my underwear.
0:31:57 - 0:32:00::But that's what they teach you and did to right.
0:32:00 - 0:32:02::The best move is to run.
0:32:02 - 0:32:03::Always.
0:32:03 - 0:32:04::Always.
0:32:04 - 0:32:07::That is the best fighting move is to run with your feet.
0:32:07 - 0:32:08::Yep.
0:32:08 - 0:32:11::The best punches, your feet punch in the ground as you fucking run out there.
0:32:11 - 0:32:18::I will say this, that my, the person that is most ready to have a home invasion, who
0:32:18 - 0:32:22::is like, do not enter this man's home is my father.
0:32:22 - 0:32:23::Wow.
0:32:23 - 0:32:24::Because he has a gun.
0:32:24 - 0:32:25::He is strapped up.
0:32:25 - 0:32:26::Oh.
0:32:26 - 0:32:30::And he is so, I feel like he is so ready for someone.
0:32:30 - 0:32:33::He's kind of begging for somebody to break into his house.
0:32:33 - 0:32:36::And he lives in kind of a small condo.
0:32:36 - 0:32:37::Yeah.
0:32:37 - 0:32:39::And his room is like kind of up the stairs.
0:32:39 - 0:32:43::And I feel like he sleeps like at the top of the stairs facing the front door.
0:32:43 - 0:32:47::Just kind of nodding off with one eye open, like kind of like a cat does a lion.
0:32:47 - 0:32:49::And he has a gun just down the side.
0:32:49 - 0:32:50::Oh my god.
0:32:50 - 0:32:51::Does he really?
0:32:51 - 0:32:56::Just ready just at the top of the stairs to just, he's just, I feel like he, that will complete him.
0:32:56 - 0:33:00::If somebody comes in, because did you know, did you know this fact?
0:33:00 - 0:33:06::But that if you murder somebody in your own home, you will not get face any consequences.
0:33:06 - 0:33:08::So I don't think that, I don't think that's fully true.
0:33:08 - 0:33:11::What if you bring them in so you can bring someone into your house in a situation?
0:33:11 - 0:33:12::It's like, it's like a defend.
0:33:12 - 0:33:14::How can you prove it's a home invasion?
0:33:14 - 0:33:15::I don't know.
0:33:15 - 0:33:16::I'm not a lawyer.
0:33:16 - 0:33:22::So if we wanted to go grab somebody and bring them to your dad and say, ooh, look who we found here.
0:33:22 - 0:33:23::Yeah.
0:33:23 - 0:33:24::He could just catch them.
0:33:24 - 0:33:25::Is that no higher thing?
0:33:25 - 0:33:27::Maybe it's just no higher thing.
0:33:27 - 0:33:29::I think that my dad has killed somebody.
0:33:29 - 0:33:32::He's like, I can, he's, he's not telling you.
0:33:32 - 0:33:34::Do not do not rob my father.
0:33:34 - 0:33:37::He was probably just trying to scare the, like, you know, make sure you're acting right.
0:33:37 - 0:33:39::He's saying, you know, I could kill you if you don't.
0:33:39 - 0:33:44::Maybe, maybe it was like a little bit of a, you know, a scare tactic.
0:33:44 - 0:33:45::Well, you should put it to the test.
0:33:45 - 0:33:46::It's a joke.
0:33:46 - 0:33:47::It's a joke.
0:33:47 - 0:33:49::Oh, the Halloween episode.
0:33:49 - 0:33:52::We need to do a, uh, Joy Hattix TV show.

0:34:04 - 0:34:09::thank calls, where we call unsuspecting businesses and we fucking thank them for how good they treated us.
0:34:09 - 0:34:12::Even if we haven't been or lying, we're thanking them.

0:39:50.900000 - 0:39:52.900000::I'm a little bit of serial killer
0:39:56.700000 - 0:39:59.980000::Well, I said I want to put on a voice because I'm walking into a gun

0:40:00 - 0:40:02::What's the fun store, whatever military store?
0:40:02 - 0:40:04::That's true, they can trace it back.
0:40:04 - 0:40:05::Eric, you know what?
0:40:05 - 0:40:07::I realized that my call was way too long.
0:40:07 - 0:40:08::And I, wait, what is it?
0:40:08 - 0:40:09::You don't want to take the time.
0:40:09 - 0:40:10::What did I do?
0:40:10 - 0:40:11::I did it, I did it lame.
0:40:11 - 0:40:12::No, you did it perfectly, Eric.
0:40:12 - 0:40:16::Yeah, the best one, but the, but calling a military surplus store.
0:40:16 - 0:40:20::I had a little bit like, you know.
0:40:20 - 0:40:24::I feel like in a weird way, they, that store needed it the most.
0:40:24 - 0:40:25::Yeah, you can tell.
0:40:25 - 0:40:26::He was the toughest to get up at.
0:40:26 - 0:40:28::That's, honestly, that's why I did the Noah thing
0:40:28 - 0:40:30::because I was like, you know what?
0:40:30 - 0:40:34::Let me try and crack this guy because I know that he's not really feeling the love.
0:40:34 - 0:40:38::And when I cracked into that Noah thing, yes, we all know it was a joke.
0:40:38 - 0:40:40::But he doesn't know that.
0:40:40 - 0:40:43::And my name isn't Noah.
0:40:43 - 0:40:48::But in that moment, I did feel like, like, it was well just hook him up with this.
0:40:48 - 0:40:54::And you know, speaking of like, we're talking about thanking people and praising people.
0:40:54 - 0:40:58::And I think there's another person that needs to kind of be shamed.
0:40:58 - 0:41:01::And the finger needs to be pointed at this man.
0:41:01 - 0:41:04::And I think I know what you guys are, you guys know I'm talking about.
0:41:04 - 0:41:06::Let me say it right into the mic.
0:41:06 - 0:41:10::If you listen to this and we're talking about you, feel ashamed.
0:41:10 - 0:41:12::It's the Leonardo DiCaprio.
0:41:12 - 0:41:15::You've got it.
0:41:15 - 0:41:20::Eric's Tony just came out as mouth person.
0:41:20 - 0:41:21::Oh my God.
0:41:21 - 0:41:23::It's Leonardo DiCaprio.
0:41:23 - 0:41:25::That was the Italian.
0:41:25 - 0:41:27::It's not like eight Tito's and Bob's.
0:41:27 - 0:41:29::That's how you say it with that.
0:41:29 - 0:41:31::That's how you get in Tito's tonight.
0:41:31 - 0:41:32::By the way, I'm off that tequila.
0:41:32 - 0:41:33::I'm on Tito's again.
0:41:33 - 0:41:35::You just hit the Atlantic City dialect.
0:41:35 - 0:41:37::That was a regional.
0:41:37 - 0:41:43::No, I mean, listen, I heard that we all know that reports have been circulating about him dating a 19 year old.
0:41:43 - 0:41:44::That's not chill.
0:41:44 - 0:41:45::That's not possible.
0:41:45 - 0:41:47::And I heard maybe he's not even dating her.
0:41:47 - 0:41:49::But you know, even the fact that that's believable.
0:41:49 - 0:41:50::Right.
0:41:50 - 0:41:51::Same one.
0:41:51 - 0:41:52::He's done it before.
0:41:52 - 0:41:53::You're dating all these.
0:41:53 - 0:41:54::Calling all paparazzi.
0:41:54 - 0:41:56::Calling all paparazzi.
0:41:56 - 0:41:58::I want you to turn it up a notch.
0:41:58 - 0:42:02::I want to take all the paparazzi that are going at every single celebrity.
0:42:02 - 0:42:03::Yeah.
0:42:03 - 0:42:05::And just kind of funnel that in and focus.
0:42:05 - 0:42:08::Because you know, there's like a top player like LeBron or something like that.
0:42:08 - 0:42:11::The yard is kind of like you know, put two people on him.
0:42:11 - 0:42:12::Right.
0:42:12 - 0:42:15::We need the paparazzi to do that to Leo and kind of fuck up his whole life and make him know that.
0:42:15 - 0:42:16::Yeah.
0:42:16 - 0:42:17::You know what I'm saying?
0:42:17 - 0:42:18::Yeah.
0:42:18 - 0:42:19::Yeah.
0:42:19 - 0:42:20::Yeah.
0:42:20 - 0:42:21::Yeah.
0:42:21 - 0:42:22::The Navy SEALs.
0:42:22 - 0:42:23::Leonardo DiCaprio SEALs.
0:42:23 - 0:42:27::I famously hate paparazzi because I think that celebrities probably should be respected.
0:42:27 - 0:42:28::Right.
0:42:28 - 0:42:32::But I think that with some of these celebrities that are acting fool like this, the paparazzi's
0:42:32 - 0:42:37::need new guerrilla tactics of like scaring the fuck out of the like symbols and pots and pans.
0:42:37 - 0:42:38::Or by the way.
0:42:38 - 0:42:39::Or by the way.
0:42:39 - 0:42:40::Or by the way.
0:42:40 - 0:42:42::Outfits that scare the fuck out of celebrities.
0:42:42 - 0:42:43::Right.
0:42:43 - 0:42:44::And take a picture of them all scared.
0:42:45 - 0:42:49::And I think they should do a 21 jump street style where it's like, okay, you know what?
0:42:49 - 0:42:54::I'm going to dress up as a 19 year old and I'm going to go get my flirt on with Leonardo DiCaprio
0:42:54 - 0:42:56::and I'm going to bust him from the inside.
0:42:56 - 0:42:57::Yeah.
0:42:57 - 0:42:59::Well, I'm going to bust on him from the inside.
0:42:59 - 0:43:01::I feel like I would do it.
0:43:01 - 0:43:02::That's the way to do it.
0:43:02 - 0:43:03::That's the next TMZ.
0:43:03 - 0:43:04::TMZ.
0:43:04 - 0:43:06::I feel like I would be like a nightmare paparazzi.
0:43:06 - 0:43:10::Like there would be like if I were a paparazzi, there would be like multiple clips of the game.
0:43:10 - 0:43:12::So you would be like, you know what that would be?
0:43:12 - 0:43:15::York was like took that fucking person to take it.
0:43:15 - 0:43:18::I would be getting veerced like left and right.
0:43:18 - 0:43:19::Oh, yeah.
0:43:19 - 0:43:25::Kanye would be fucking like biting off my fucking like, you know how to talk to people nicely, man.
0:43:25 - 0:43:27::I feel like if it's, I would be on that face.

0:50:45 - 0:50:47::I think I might need some more cookies.
0:50:47 - 0:50:53::Oh, these cookies flood in from a dump truck into the pool.
0:50:53 - 0:50:55::I'm like, that's enough.
0:50:55 - 0:50:57::Okay, one more.

0:51:00.400000 - 0:51:03::that we were bitter in Africa.
0:51:03 - 0:51:05::And I just said, they're so bad at the time they came in front of something.

0:51:35.440000 - 0:51:39.400000::Speaking of virality, I think advertisement agencies
0:51:39.400000 - 0:51:43.240000::need to wake up a little bit and kind of make fucked up ads
0:51:43.240000 - 0:51:45.840000::to like, tarnish a brand just for a moment.
0:51:45.840000 - 0:51:48.960000::Because those type of moments,
0:51:48.960000 - 0:51:52.600000::I feel like do more for the brand than like,

0:52:15.640000 - 0:52:19.560000::But I guarantee you there would be more Big Mac sold on that day
