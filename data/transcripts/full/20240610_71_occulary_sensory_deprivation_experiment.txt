0:00:21.280000 - 0:00:22.280000::I know.
0:00:22.280000 - 0:00:24.800000::I'll have to take your word for it because I can't see either.
0:00:24.800000 - 0:00:26.480000::You can hear us though, right?
0:00:26.480000 - 0:00:28.920000::Oh, I can hear you guys.
0:00:28.920000 - 0:00:32.040000::This is really actually right away making me feel crazy.
0:00:32.040000 - 0:00:36.600000::First of all, let's just peel back the car.
0:00:36.600000 - 0:00:37.600000::We can't bail.
0:00:37.600000 - 0:00:45.440000::If you bail, if we're fucking 30 seconds in, all right, it's the fucking visual, ocularious
0:00:45.440000 - 0:00:49::sensory deprivation episode, dude.
0:00:49 - 0:00:50::And guess what?
0:00:50 - 0:00:51.400000::We've been begging for this.
0:00:51.400000 - 0:00:56.080000::The thing my eyeballs are freezing out of my head because this thing is fresh out the
0:00:56.080000 - 0:00:57.080000::freezer.
0:00:57.080000 - 0:00:58.320000::We didn't do it first off.
0:00:58.320000 - 0:01:01.760000::What's everybody using to cover up their eyes, eyes right now?
0:01:01.760000 - 0:01:07.320000::I'm using a bandana that was actually used for the pen.
0:01:07.320000 - 0:01:09.800000::It's a kind of past relic of the pandemic.
0:01:09.800000 - 0:01:14.600000::Remember when we had people who were, had to, didn't really have mass, but they kind of
0:01:14.600000 - 0:01:15.600000::had bandanas.
0:01:15.600000 - 0:01:16.600000::They put over there.
0:01:16.600000 - 0:01:17.600000::Right.
0:01:17.600000 - 0:01:24.200000::But if you really knew about masking, yeah, exactly, Jack, if you really knew about masking,
0:01:24.200000 - 0:01:26.360000::you wouldn't know what bandana doesn't do shit.
0:01:26.360000 - 0:01:28::And actually makes it worse.
0:01:28 - 0:01:31.560000::Imagine being a gentleman walking up to a bandana.
0:01:31.560000 - 0:01:33.640000::I would literally laugh my ass off.
0:01:33.640000 - 0:01:35.280000::Yo, look at this dumbass mouth.
0:01:35.280000 - 0:01:36.760000::Let's go in it.
0:01:36.760000 - 0:01:37.760000::Right.
0:01:37.760000 - 0:01:38.760000::The gym.
0:01:38.760000 - 0:01:39.760000::The gym.
0:01:39.760000 - 0:01:45.600000::It's like having a three-year-old bouncer outside of the fucking club, which I have seen.
0:01:45.600000 - 0:01:46.600000::Okay.
0:01:46.600000 - 0:01:47.760000::I fuck with bouncers.
0:01:47.760000 - 0:01:49.160000::I really fuck with bouncers.
0:01:49.160000 - 0:01:50.160000::I always doubt.
0:01:50.160000 - 0:01:51.160000::I don't.
0:01:51.160000 - 0:01:52.160000::Guys.
0:01:52.160000 - 0:01:55.440000::Well, yeah, because, well, you don't.
0:01:55.440000 - 0:01:57::What are you talking about?
0:01:57 - 0:01:58::Of course I don't.
0:01:58 - 0:02:00.920000::They're, they're, they're the gatekeepers to the club.
0:02:00.920000 - 0:02:01.920000::You know what I'm saying?
0:02:01.920000 - 0:02:03.160000::The club is for everybody.
0:02:03.160000 - 0:02:08.240000::There should be, there should be nobody at the front that's saying, no, yes, it should
0:02:08.240000 - 0:02:12.960000::be an open space for everybody to inclusive.
0:02:12.960000 - 0:02:14.920000::But even paradise needs law and order.
0:02:14.920000 - 0:02:15.920000::You know what I'm saying?
0:02:15.920000 - 0:02:16.920000::Wow.
0:02:16.920000 - 0:02:18.920000::I'm actually an anti-cop.
0:02:18.920000 - 0:02:23.160000::In a sense, so to speak, but I'm pro-bouncer.
0:02:23.160000 - 0:02:24.160000::You see what I'm saying?
0:02:24.160000 - 0:02:26.760000::Even cops are just being forced law and order.
0:02:26.760000 - 0:02:27.760000::Right.
0:02:27.760000 - 0:02:29.440000::I believe in how the laws, I love laws.
0:02:29.440000 - 0:02:30.880000::I just don't want to fucking enforce them.
0:02:30.880000 - 0:02:36.040000::And I don't think anybody should enforce them because not all laws are correct.
0:02:36.040000 - 0:02:37.040000::That's for sure.
0:02:37.040000 - 0:02:40.520000::Well, people don't know is outside of the podcast when we're just talking normally.
0:02:40.520000 - 0:02:42.520000::We speak in legal ease.
0:02:42.520000 - 0:02:46.280000::Legal ease.
0:02:46.280000 - 0:02:47.280000::Legal terms.
0:02:47.280000 - 0:02:48.280000::Apropos.
0:02:48.280000 - 0:02:49.280000::Nothing.
0:02:49.280000 - 0:02:53.560000::I can't see if you guys are laughing at my amazing the way that I'm speaking or not.
0:02:53.560000 - 0:02:58::Yeah, just pointing my microwave for that.
0:02:58 - 0:02:59::Sorry.
0:02:59 - 0:03:06.520000::But if I for one second find out that it went to one or two of you guys are bailing on
0:03:06.520000 - 0:03:09.560000::the blindfold part and I'm the only one.
0:03:09.560000 - 0:03:10.560000::Oh, that's a great idea.
0:03:10.560000 - 0:03:15.240000::I'm going to be so it's going to that's going to be a final strike in our friendship and
0:03:15.240000 - 0:03:19.880000::collaborative careers together.
0:03:19.880000 - 0:03:20.880000::Okay.
0:03:20.880000 - 0:03:23.120000::How many strikes am I on right now, Nate?
0:03:23.120000 - 0:03:28.800000::You are I know the general rule is three strikes, you know, baseball terms.
0:03:28.800000 - 0:03:32.320000::Yeah, but you are well past three strikes, Eric.
0:03:32.320000 - 0:03:35.560000::Yeah, we're into three.
0:03:35.560000 - 0:03:38.400000::Three to the what power?
0:03:38.400000 - 0:03:40.960000::Three to the three to the 10th power, man.
0:03:40.960000 - 0:03:44.960000::Oh, that's no joke.
0:03:44.960000 - 0:03:49.120000::And I wish and I don't know why I keep on letting you rack up these strikes, Eric, because
0:03:49.120000 - 0:03:51.120000::of my charm.
0:03:51.120000 - 0:03:52.120000::Right.
0:03:52.120000 - 0:03:54.120000::You're so charming.
0:03:54.120000 - 0:03:57.160000::Man, I wish I could show you all what I'm doing right now.
0:03:57.160000 - 0:03:58.680000::You sound different.
0:03:58.680000 - 0:04:01.920000::Wait, is my audio still okay?
0:04:01.920000 - 0:04:09.960000::Frankly, what I do is I put the microphone down the top of my blindfold so I don't have
0:04:09.960000 - 0:04:11.480000::to hold my microphone anymore.
0:04:11.480000 - 0:04:14.560000::It's kind of sticking out the bottom of my blindfold.
0:04:14.560000 - 0:04:16.720000::I do sense a different sound.
0:04:16.720000 - 0:04:19.400000::I'm auditorily from you.
0:04:19.400000 - 0:04:21.920000::But I'm glad you pointed that out.
0:04:21.920000 - 0:04:23.920000::Yeah, I'll take it out.
0:04:23.920000 - 0:04:28.920000::Audio file listeners, but it does make it more immersive, a more immersive experience.
0:04:28.920000 - 0:04:29.920000::Okay.
0:04:29.920000 - 0:04:33.440000::By the way, isn't it hilarious that people just listening to this on Spotify?
0:04:33.440000 - 0:04:37.560000::Like it's this doesn't matter to them like at all.
0:04:37.560000 - 0:04:38.560000::Right.
0:04:38.560000 - 0:04:43.520000::Well, it's hilarious, but it's also unfortunate because they're missing out on the benefit
0:04:43.520000 - 0:04:45.440000::of the experiment.
0:04:45.440000 - 0:04:49.600000::If you're listening, you should be blindfolded as well to get the full effect and comment
0:04:49.600000 - 0:04:53.200000::what you're being blindfolded by.
0:04:53.200000 - 0:04:54.200000::So airway.
0:04:54.200000 - 0:04:55.560000::I'll say what I'm being blindfolded by.
0:04:55.560000 - 0:04:58.360000::I'm being blindfolded by some drive fit.
0:04:58.360000 - 0:04:58.960000::Her pull.

0:05:00 - 0:05:08.880000::um, clean. These are just washed unwashed. No, no, Nike running shorts that I cut the mesh out of.
0:05:11.040000 - 0:05:15.600000::You cut the mesh out so you wouldn't get sand in it. I cut the mesh out so I could wear my
0:05:15.600000 - 0:05:21.840000::boxer briefs up in these pieces. There are, there are some perverts out there that are so jealous of
0:05:21.840000 - 0:05:27.040000::what kind of setup you have going on right now. They would kill to be. They wish they had not a pair
0:05:27.040000 - 0:05:32.800000::of air, very good running shorts all over their fucking face. Well, it's going to be a possibility very
0:05:32.800000 - 0:05:42.160000::soon once I get my online store working. It's all you. It's all you. Yeah, briefly you sweat in
0:05:42.160000 - 0:05:47.040000::each pair one time and get them all soaked up and then doesn't take long. Doesn't take much.
0:05:47.040000 - 0:05:58.800000::And Jack, Jack has maybe the craziest one. Well, frankly, I'm very uncomfortable and I'm in pain
0:05:59.760000 - 0:06:09.040000::because this is Sarah ice, my grain relief pack from the freezer. So this is freezing fucking cold.
0:06:09.040000 - 0:06:13.920000::And I have been like kind of pulling on it and separating it from my eyes to try to give them a
0:06:13.920000 - 0:06:21.840000::break. And it is warming up. Thankfully, but this thing is my head is really, really cold right now
0:06:21.840000 - 0:06:28.160000::for this. So you're going on hard mode. Essentially, you're doing this on hard sort of extra cold
0:06:28.160000 - 0:06:39.760000::mode. Yeah, because I guess I don't know why. But there's got to be something to the, we're talking
0:06:39.760000 - 0:06:47.200000::about sensory, right? Sensory deprivation. Yeah, yeah. I'm experiencing, I would say hyper a
0:06:47.200000 - 0:06:55.360000::hyper sensory sensor feeling by and that feeling is cold. Because when you go to sensory deprivation
0:06:55.360000 - 0:07:02.240000::tank, you're deprived of every sense is what the goal is. And then you hear the silence of the
0:07:02.240000 - 0:07:10.400000::universe, which is actually painfully loud. Damn, say that again. The silence of the universe
0:07:10.400000 - 0:07:20::is a painfully loud, infinite jar of inner dimensional coins, hanging around in a metal tin
0:07:20.240000 - 0:07:26.720000::of 18 infinity style dimensions. And when you go into a sensory deprivation tank, that's the
0:07:26.720000 - 0:07:33.120000::first thing you notice is that there's no sense thing is the end. There's only, well, it sounds,
0:07:33.120000 - 0:07:39.680000::you know, it's like a ring here. It just sounds weird. What if the, you know what I always feel when
0:07:39.680000 - 0:07:48.160000::my senses are deprived? Boaner. Well, yeah, I mean, you're my sounds different now Nate.
0:07:49.200000 - 0:07:55.920000::I know I'm hearing a different. Oh, Nate. Oh, thank you. And I can't check right now. So who knows?
0:07:55.920000 - 0:08:02.320000::Nate, you sound like you're on a prison phone. Are you serious? Yes. Oh, you know what it is.
0:08:02.320000 - 0:08:07.920000::Well, God, I have to check. I have to do a, okay, you're breaking the experiment, but it's for
0:08:07.920000 - 0:08:11.120000::breaking the experiment real quick to check my audio.
0:08:12.800000 - 0:08:15.760000::Oh, yeah. The most one unplugged.
0:08:17.840000 - 0:08:25.040000::Am I going to get sick from this? No, I could, I don't get sick. You just want this is, by the way,
0:08:25.040000 - 0:08:31.120000::to everybody listening, this is what real science is. Yeah, people like to write little articles
0:08:31.120000 - 0:08:36.320000::and write little studies based on mice. No one's doing it like this anymore where you really put
0:08:36.320000 - 0:08:44.800000::yourself in the damn driver's seat. Be the mouse. Be the mouse yourself, right? That's bravery. I just
0:08:44.800000 - 0:08:49.920000::want to encourage others to do their own type of studies and report them onto our internal J
0:08:49.920000 - 0:08:55.600000::store like a website that we have for scholarly articles that we're writing. That's right.
0:08:55.600000 - 0:08:59.200000::And I sound better now. Don't I? Yes, you sound. Thank you. Amazing.
0:09:00 - 0:09:05.120000::This is real. I'm serious. Go ahead. Well, I just realized how are we going to, we're going to have
0:09:05.120000 - 0:09:12.560000::to use our internal intuition to and figure out when we've done an hour. This one's going to feel
0:09:12.560000 - 0:09:17.760000::extra long. I can just tell you that much. Yeah, I can feel that in a good way. We're going to be
0:09:17.760000 - 0:09:22.240000::enjoying it so much that time's going to. It's like time we turn time into a lot of pop that we
0:09:22.240000 - 0:09:27.280000::could suck on. Peanut butter style top. Don't do peanut butter bad for your skin. I just learned
0:09:28.960000 - 0:09:33.280000::eating. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. No, no, no, no, I can't get you. I can't get you. Where you
0:09:33.280000 - 0:09:40.640000::say? Well, I was going to say, it's funny that we're doing this, right? The visual deprivation.
0:09:41.120000 - 0:09:50.080000::The hour because yesterday I had what you would call a medical experience in my eyes.
0:09:51.280000 - 0:09:56.960000::And what happened was this. I think I've brought it up before on this podcast. But once in a while,
0:09:56.960000 - 0:09:59.920000::I will get something that is called migraine.

0:10:00 - 0:10:09.840000::with aura where people have pain with associated with this minus zero pain. It's just a aura in my vision.
0:10:09.840000 - 0:10:14.720000::And it'll happen right after I go to the gym. It usually happens like this. I don't eat enough
0:10:14.720000 - 0:10:21.520000::in the morning. I go to the gym. I blast blast to is to Americano. And I haven't eaten, you know,
0:10:21.520000 - 0:10:28.320000::my blood sugar is low or something like this. And then it'll cause a migraine with aura. And if you
0:10:28.320000 - 0:10:32.320000::don't know what that is, it kind of starts in my vision. It starts like this. It's like a pin prick
0:10:32.320000 - 0:10:37.040000::in the middle of my vision that looks kind of technical or in round and like glowing and flashing.
0:10:38.080000 - 0:10:44.320000::And that shit over the course of about 45 minutes like expands to across both my eyes. And it looks
0:10:44.320000 - 0:10:52.880000::like fucking crazy. I can't see it disturbs it. It makes it impossible to drive or focus on anything
0:10:52.880000 - 0:11:00.240000::because your vision is it gets all inverted. And so that happened to me yesterday. And I wasn't
0:11:00.240000 - 0:11:04.880000::going to share it because it's very emotional. But that happened to me yesterday. And I think
0:11:04.880000 - 0:11:09.040000::that's what inspired me to recommend that we did go blindfolded because I was really in
0:11:10.400000 - 0:11:16.240000::my thoughts, Chamber yesterday really thinking about things differently because my vision was
0:11:16.240000 - 0:11:22.080000::impaired. How interesting. Cool. Man. Sounds really hard, man. Sounds really scary.
0:11:24.480000 - 0:11:31.520000::Literally every time I get once a year, every time I think it's the end, I always think I'm
0:11:31.520000 - 0:11:38.960000::fucking dying. I'll tell you what next time it happens, it is the end. I know the next one.
0:11:38.960000 - 0:11:43.920000::I know. I know like the next one was not then, but the next one, the next one is about to be like
0:11:43.920000 - 0:11:50.800000::life ending crazy. Eric me is prayer right now. Did you stop praying for Eric? Do you feel that
0:11:50.800000 - 0:11:55.680000::Eric? I feel like people are definitely something. And they've definitely I feel like they've stopped.
0:11:56.640000 - 0:12:03.120000::The prayers have stopped and I feel like you can feel that. Eric is constant prayer or else it's
0:12:03.840000 - 0:12:08.960000::it's lights out. We go on. If we spend more because this hour is about as long as Eric can take
0:12:08.960000 - 0:12:14.880000::without even us giving us him a prayer in person. If we're spending the day to get
0:12:17.200000 - 0:12:21.440000::you do you need a prayer event you need to be on the prayer ventilator you need to have a priest
0:12:21.440000 - 0:12:26.640000::speaking down your throat all day. Well, and I'm agnostic when it comes to which religion is
0:12:26.640000 - 0:12:31.680000::praying for me. You could be of course, Muslim, you could be Hindu, you could be and you could be
0:12:31.680000 - 0:12:38.480000::all those all day. I switched I switched religions once twice a day. Switch. Yeah, right. Exactly.
0:12:38.480000 - 0:12:49.760000::It's the remix to religion. So I'm Muslim now I'm Christian now I'm rolling rolling with Buddha
0:12:49.760000 - 0:12:57.680000::and now I'm rolling with this one. Dip it on one and crack his I'm like nobody else. I'm a freaking
0:12:57.680000 - 0:13:03.600000::Puerto Rican. No, no, no, that's not right. Puerto Rican, the religion. Maybe I'm about to
0:13:03.760000 - 0:13:08.800000::do your religion. I would believe in Puerto Rico as a god if I could.
0:13:11.200000 - 0:13:16.960000::Puerto Rico as a godly figure. Hell yeah, yeah, I could see that. Damn, I didn't show
0:13:16.960000 - 0:13:21.680000::me when I was in my car because what happens? Well, I just want to give it up for you doing that real
0:13:21.680000 - 0:13:25.760000::quick. No, no, no, please, please, please, no, what bro? No, no, no, no, no, please, please.
0:13:27.520000 - 0:13:33.040000::I'm getting little threads from the damn shorts in my mouth. But yesterday, because what happens is
0:13:33.040000 - 0:13:38.880000::it starts okay. It's not so crazy. But by the end, the aura is like just in your peripherals
0:13:38.880000 - 0:13:44.720000::and it looks like you just can't see anything on the side. And it's like, it looks like electricity
0:13:44.720000 - 0:13:50.400000::going all through your eyes. And I was talking to Layla on the phone and I was doing breathing like this.
0:13:51.840000 - 0:13:56.480000::Oh god, like that. And once it got to the peripherals, not kidding, I went like this.
0:13:56.960000 - 0:14:01.440000::Oh, no, but listen, that's just the sound.
0:14:03.360000 - 0:14:12.160000::Like something came out of me from the core. Yeah, yeah, yeah, the stuff. So scared. So
0:14:12.160000 - 0:14:18.560000::fucking scared. We need to bottle it up like I do. Because I'll have, remember when I had,
0:14:18.560000 - 0:14:24.480000::I had one of the worst pancakes I've ever had in your car and see. With my friend Nick,
0:14:24.480000 - 0:14:28.400000::that was crazy. And I just didn't say anything for a couple of minutes. But I was like level 10.
0:14:29.680000 - 0:14:35.360000::Thought I might have to go to the hospital and not leave the city. Oh my god, that was crazy.
0:14:35.360000 - 0:14:42.160000::I remember that moment exactly. But that was fun. No one's getting down like this vulnerability wise.
0:14:42.160000 - 0:14:52::I at least on the male side. No, they're not. And, and, and, um, shame, shame, shame, shame,
0:14:52 - 0:14:59.760000::shame. Yeah, just shame. It's funny because shame is what they do operate by. See what I'm saying.

0:15:00 - 0:15:05.680000::They are afraid to admit these things because they're ashamed of it.
0:15:05.680000 - 0:15:08.560000::And yet they should so you know what reverse.
0:15:08.560000 - 0:15:11.080000::I'm just I don't even care anymore.
0:15:11.080000 - 0:15:12.080000::I took off my eyes.
0:15:12.080000 - 0:15:14.680000::I know who should feel shame.
0:15:14.680000 - 0:15:15.680000::You took it off.
0:15:15.680000 - 0:15:16.680000::You got eyes out.
0:15:16.680000 - 0:15:17.680000::No, no, no, no.
0:15:17.680000 - 0:15:19.160000::I just pulled my hood over my eyes.
0:15:19.160000 - 0:15:21.080000::So now my hood is my thing.
0:15:21.080000 - 0:15:25.840000::However, the ice pack is now warming up on my legs because my and by the way, my head is
0:15:25.840000 - 0:15:27.680000::still really cold.
0:15:28.560000 - 0:15:30.600000::You gotta do that.
0:15:30.600000 - 0:15:31.440000::I'm sorry.
0:15:31.440000 - 0:15:32.440000::That'll happen.
0:15:32.440000 - 0:15:33.440000::No, no, dude, it's okay.
0:15:33.440000 - 0:15:35.960000::I like really, but I can't see.
0:15:35.960000 - 0:15:38.400000::Nate, I can't see shit either.
0:15:38.400000 - 0:15:40.160000::And I'm going to be honest.
0:15:40.160000 - 0:15:46.520000::I've had my I've been I've been looking and seeing for about like maybe 15 minutes.
0:15:46.520000 - 0:15:47.840000::Nate, you haven't.
0:15:47.840000 - 0:15:51.520000::No, you got to hear my my vocals are a little bit different right now because I'm trying
0:15:51.520000 - 0:15:54.640000::to fidget my mic cord is all fucked up.
0:15:54.640000 - 0:16:00.400000::And I said before this, if I have one more technical difficulty, I'm quitting the podcast.
0:16:00.400000 - 0:16:05.440000::And this this mic cord right now is really fucking up my whole fucking shit.
0:16:05.440000 - 0:16:09.280000::Well, you're, do you know, do you know that your mic is not working right now, Nate?
0:16:09.280000 - 0:16:10.280000::Yeah.
0:16:10.280000 - 0:16:11.280000::Yeah, I know.
0:16:11.280000 - 0:16:12.640000::I'm trying, I'm trying to get it worked.
0:16:12.640000 - 0:16:14.080000::That's why I'm looking right now.
0:16:14.080000 - 0:16:15.080000::Okay.
0:16:15.080000 - 0:16:17.280000::Out of the bottom of my bandana.
0:16:17.280000 - 0:16:18.880000::Isn't it interesting?
0:16:18.880000 - 0:16:22.920000::I do really like this, this in a sense.
0:16:22.920000 - 0:16:28.600000::Because when we, it's almost like, I don't, God, I wish I could think of a great metaphor
0:16:28.600000 - 0:16:30.040000::for this.
0:16:30.040000 - 0:16:36.340000::But the second that we removed a tool, we realized what, what, what a deficiency and what
0:16:36.340000 - 0:16:41.900000::a reliance we have and how much we should be appreciating that tool because we're falling
0:16:41.900000 - 0:16:43.600000::apart without it.
0:16:43.600000 - 0:16:49.400000::I mean, so then something's good.
0:16:49.400000 - 0:16:53.720000::You know, I was just going to try and see if anybody could think of a good metaphor for
0:16:53.720000 - 0:16:54.720000::that.
0:16:54.720000 - 0:16:56.520000::This is a very metaphorical community.
0:16:56.520000 - 0:16:57.920000::Talked about them in front of that.
0:16:57.920000 - 0:17:02.240000::Oh, there's no doubt about no one's questioning that this is a metaphorical community.
0:17:02.240000 - 0:17:08.120000::But what I wanted to say was this, we've talked on our phones our whole lives, right?
0:17:08.120000 - 0:17:10.120000::What's up, man?
0:17:10.120000 - 0:17:11.120000::Ring Ring, classic.
0:17:11.120000 - 0:17:13.760000::They've been around for almost a hundred years at this point.
0:17:13.760000 - 0:17:16.320000::Alexander Graham Bell.
0:17:16.320000 - 0:17:20.680000::Now what happens when you take away the visual and you guys are just in my ears and we're
0:17:20.680000 - 0:17:24::talking like this, all of a sudden, it almost feels like a new technology.
0:17:24 - 0:17:27.440000::You know, I'm saying, where you guys are right in my brain with me.
0:17:27.440000 - 0:17:32.560000::It's like we're chilling in a, you know, I'm saying, yeah, it feels like we're in VR in
0:17:32.560000 - 0:17:33.560000::our heads.
0:17:33.560000 - 0:17:37.160000::And I just haven't imagined what you guys as curbs, curbs are looking right, like right
0:17:37.160000 - 0:17:42.400000::now, what kind of colonial wearing, what kind of shit you got on like that?
0:17:43.400000 - 0:17:49.840000::Yeah, you couldn't, I don't think the Cologne, I don't think you'd get through the zoom.
0:17:49.840000 - 0:17:53.440000::But yeah, I do see, right, but I mean, it does feel that way.
0:17:53.440000 - 0:18:00.240000::It gives it, it does feel like a new sensory experience from the, from the get go where
0:18:00.240000 - 0:18:01.640000::it was like, oh, right.
0:18:01.640000 - 0:18:05.720000::You do feel even more here than ever.
0:18:05.720000 - 0:18:07.240000::Word later should have to do this.
0:18:07.240000 - 0:18:10.760000::You want to solve all this conflict going on in the world right now, put some running
0:18:10.760000 - 0:18:17.560000::short on the lens keys head, but the lens keys head and a sweaty pair air gray hills
0:18:17.560000 - 0:18:21.240000::swords and not sweaty and I've never sweating these things.
0:18:21.240000 - 0:18:22.240000::All right.
0:18:22.240000 - 0:18:23.240000::And I never will.
0:18:23.240000 - 0:18:25.960000::Don't be, you know, you don't know it.
0:18:25.960000 - 0:18:27.600000::And if you did, it'd be totally fine.
0:18:27.600000 - 0:18:29.400000::That's all I'll say.
0:18:29.400000 - 0:18:30.400000::Right.
0:18:30.400000 - 0:18:31.400000::Yeah.
0:18:31.400000 - 0:18:36.520000::And then put, and then I guess, yeah, that'd be the end of war.
0:18:36.520000 - 0:18:44.360000::If you stop seeing each other and start listening to each other, very freeing.
0:18:44.360000 - 0:18:47.600000::Speaking of sensations, I've been.
0:18:47.600000 - 0:18:50.800000::Keep getting the anthrasm on my mouth.
0:18:50.800000 - 0:18:53.400000::Speaking of sensations, okay.
0:18:53.400000 - 0:18:59.600000::I've been waking up and panic every night as if my family's dying like that.
0:18:59.600000 - 0:19:00.600000::Okay.
0:19:00.600000 - 0:19:01.600000::What the hell is it?
0:19:01.600000 - 0:19:02.800000::It's not the sleep out near.
0:19:02.800000 - 0:19:03.800000::It's not anymore.
0:19:03.800000 - 0:19:06.400000::I've got that shit fixed.
0:19:06.400000 - 0:19:09.080000::Essentially, this is something else.
0:19:09.080000 - 0:19:11.120000::What am I so afraid of?
0:19:11.120000 - 0:19:13.880000::What am I running from in my waking life?
0:19:13.880000 - 0:19:18.120000::That might get right on my back.
0:19:18.120000 - 0:19:19.120000::Let's go.
0:19:19.120000 - 0:19:24.480000::10% luck, 20% skill.
0:19:24.480000 - 0:19:30.200000::So anyone who was watching the YouTube has just been seeing me sort of trying to fidget
0:19:30.200000 - 0:19:32.320000::with different chords for the last 20 minutes.
0:19:32.320000 - 0:19:35.360000::I don't even know what the hell you guys were talking about.
0:19:35.360000 - 0:19:39.880000::But this is something that we've never brought up on this podcast before.
0:19:39.880000 - 0:19:47.280000::All I know is I have an uncanny ability to jump back in midway in conversation, not even
0:19:47.280000 - 0:19:53.240000::knowing what the hell is going on, what people are talking about and be able to seamlessly
0:19:53.240000 - 0:19:57.680000::enter in the conversation as if I had been there from the beginning from the start.
0:19:57.680000 - 0:19:58.880000::Is that from your childhood?
0:19:58.880000 - 0:19:59.880000::This is a position.

0:20:00 - 0:20:07.040000::episodes. You're right. Yeah. Like nothing happened. You were there the whole time.
0:20:07.680000 - 0:20:12.720000::Well, you're melt. Nate, do you have floaters? We've already talked about this.
0:20:13.360000 - 0:20:17.680000::Oh, bro, floaters. Do you have floaters in your vision, Nate?
0:20:19.280000 - 0:20:25.520000::Oh, what is that? I don't think so. Sometimes you don't have floaters.
0:20:26.480000 - 0:20:30.960000::What is that? Like a little, I don't know what it's like little dust in your vision.
0:20:30.960000 - 0:20:34.720000::That little squiggles all around. What are your eyes around? Yeah.
0:20:34.720000 - 0:20:39.120000::Little squiggles. It seems to be like where you can see like the cells, like kind of.
0:20:40.160000 - 0:20:43.760000::No, no. Oh, yeah. I guess you could. Do you think those are cells?
0:20:44.320000 - 0:20:46.240000::I don't think they're cells. I think I'm thinking of cell.
0:20:47.120000 - 0:20:50.640000::Because you look at them and they don't have you. Go ahead. Go ahead.
0:20:51.200000 - 0:20:56.240000::Well, I was just going to say they look oddly specific and almost as if they were designed.
0:20:57.520000 - 0:21:02.800000::Almost like a language that's trying to be spoken to me through the back of my eyeballs,
0:21:02.800000 - 0:21:06.320000::through dust in the back of my eyeballs. You're trying to crack the
0:21:06.320000 - 0:21:13.040000::risetta down for eye floaters. Yeah. Well, that could be the Anunnaki sort of awakening.
0:21:13.040000 - 0:21:17.280000::Like once the, you know what I mean? They put the code is inside of us already.
0:21:17.280000 - 0:21:23.200000::Everybody's drawing your floaters out on paper and let's melt them all together and see what it
0:21:23.200000 - 0:21:31.600000::spells out. Getting to the end. We're going to get down and down and
0:21:31.600000 - 0:21:41.120000::tells me we're going to run up the Anunnaki. We need to do a whole episode on the genetic
0:21:41.120000 - 0:21:46.720000::modification of human beings. That was initiated by the Anunnaki.
0:21:46.800000 - 0:21:51.520000::Well, they're the gift bringers. They're what we called the gift bringers, the gift of civilization.
0:21:52.160000 - 0:21:58.960000::We were just running around hands and feet on our hands and feet. Then they came to town. Boom.
0:21:58.960000 - 0:22:07.040000::Mesopotamia. Boom Egypt. Boom. Aztec. Boom. Why was it? Medieval year at boom.
0:22:07.040000 - 0:22:11.600000::St. Paul. Minnesota. Yeah. The loose boom.
0:22:11.760000 - 0:22:16.400000::Boom. Boom. Santa Fe. Boom. Arizona. Boom guitar center. And then
0:22:17.280000 - 0:22:22.800000::next day, you know, joy tactics. That's simple. Then the reign of joy tactics.
0:22:23.840000 - 0:22:30.880000::The joy Anunnaki. What do you think when they, you look at our Wikipedia pages at the museum
0:22:31.760000 - 0:22:37.600000::in about 60 years. The stone with television film. Mm-hmm. Right. Whatever.
0:22:38.080000 - 0:22:41.360000::Yeah. The years for joy tactics will say what?
0:22:41.360000 - 0:22:48.080000::Twenty. Twenty two to. Twenty one.
0:22:48.080000 - 0:22:55.120000::So maybe two. Twenty one. Twenty one. Fifty seven.
0:22:55.120000 - 0:23:00.400000::Oh, okay. Why? Because our children are going to start running this back.
0:23:00.400000 - 0:23:05.200000::We talked about that. Haven't we? No one's done that. Yeah. A generational pass down.
0:23:06.080000 - 0:23:10.880000::Oh, did you get those fucking netbo? We're building generational wealth through the Patreon.
0:23:10.880000 - 0:23:15.440000::You know, what are we going to do? We're going to pass this on to generational knowledge,
0:23:15.440000 - 0:23:21.920000::generational customs and traditions. Okay. It's a generational sexual swag.
0:23:21.920000 - 0:23:29.520000::Generational. I choked. Yeah.
0:23:30.480000 - 0:23:37.600000::Wow. It's interesting how quickly we can adapt it, isn't it? Yeah. Because when I first put
0:23:37.600000 - 0:23:46.160000::these shorts on, it was like putting a leash on a wild, old fucking horse. They are a saddle, I mean,
0:23:46.160000 - 0:23:49.600000::they don't want to feel that shit because they're used to running wild through the,
0:23:50.480000 - 0:23:57.040000::through the planes. Get the shit off me. Now all of a sudden, I can't imagine life sort of without
0:23:57.120000 - 0:24:03.120000::these on. I'm so used to it. You see what I'm saying? God made us so adaptable.
0:24:04.480000 - 0:24:12.560000::It makes me feel. Do you feel your senses? Because when you lose one sense, your other senses
0:24:12.560000 - 0:24:17.920000::are heightened. So you're imagining what are you touch? You're touch right now is probably if
0:24:17.920000 - 0:24:21.600000::you're touching things that might feel like you're on fucking Molly or something like that because
0:24:21.600000 - 0:24:26.800000::it might feel incredibly amazing. That's funny. You say that because while you were talking,
0:24:26.800000 - 0:24:33.520000::I was thinking, why do I want to tickle you guys so badly? Oh, shit. I wish I could take
0:24:33.520000 - 0:24:37.040000::you know what I'm saying? I wish I would. I wish it could be tickling right now. So I would
0:24:37.040000 - 0:24:42.080000::tickle you all crazy. Both of you right now for us near me. If your little arm, arm,
0:24:42.080000 - 0:24:48.800000::it was near me. I tickle. When we're in person, like, it's, I'm not even tickling. It does go down,
0:24:48.800000 - 0:24:52.480000::like crazy when we're out of the bar. Step one, it's basically our handshake.
0:24:52.480000 - 0:24:59.920000::But what's so funny is like, I'm not even tickling. I'm like, you guys can try, but I'm not even tickling.

0:25:00 - 0:25:02.400000::Not even in your ear, dude.
0:25:02.400000 - 0:25:08::Yeah, I dare anybody like you could try it, but yeah, but it does turn you on that.
0:25:08 - 0:25:09.280000::What if I put my beard here?
0:25:09.280000 - 0:25:10.800000::Like I put my little touch.
0:25:10.800000 - 0:25:13.200000::I put my little go to here and your ear.
0:25:13.200000 - 0:25:14.720000::How's that gonna make you sickle?
0:25:14.720000 - 0:25:23.120000::Yeah, I don't know what you guys remember this?
0:25:23.120000 - 0:25:24.080000::What?
0:25:24.080000 - 0:25:25.600000::Getting a raspberry?
0:25:25.600000 - 0:25:26.720000::You guys remember this?
0:25:26.720000 - 0:25:27.680000::Oh, yeah.
0:25:27.680000 - 0:25:29.680000::I never got one of these.
0:25:29.680000 - 0:25:31.680000::No, I never got one.
0:25:31.680000 - 0:25:32.800000::I've been offered them a lot.
0:25:32.800000 - 0:25:35.520000::Somebody blows blows on your stomach.
0:25:36.480000 - 0:25:38.640000::Bakes kind of like a fart sound on your stomach.
0:25:38.640000 - 0:25:39.600000::I do that.
0:25:39.600000 - 0:25:40.720000::I'll do that to bubbles.
0:25:42.240000 - 0:25:43.120000::You do that to your dog.
0:25:46.480000 - 0:25:47.040000::Yeah, I do.
0:25:53.520000 - 0:25:54.240000::Who doesn't?
0:25:54.240000 - 0:25:55.120000::I feel like raspberry.
0:25:56.080000 - 0:25:58.560000::And is Lalo okay with that?
0:26:00.240000 - 0:26:00.960000::It's awesome.
0:26:00.960000 - 0:26:01.840000::It's like, yeah, we're taking.
0:26:04.720000 - 0:26:05.680000::Taking turns.
0:26:05.680000 - 0:26:06.800000::Yeah, no, it's awesome.
0:26:06.800000 - 0:26:10.240000::Every creature should get a raspberry.
0:26:10.240000 - 0:26:11.200000::And I'll tell you what.
0:26:12.960000 - 0:26:14.640000::We were talking about cute animals the other day.
0:26:14.640000 - 0:26:16.800000::A lot of these animals like to be cradled.
0:26:16.800000 - 0:26:17.120000::Okay.
0:26:18 - 0:26:18.720000::Like a baby?
0:26:20.320000 - 0:26:21.120000::Like a baby.
0:26:21.120000 - 0:26:23.520000::Like you know, who remains like to be cradled?
0:26:24.240000 - 0:26:27.600000::Donkeys have you seen the young donkey being cradled by the guy?
0:26:27.600000 - 0:26:28.560000::You mean a ass?
0:26:30.880000 - 0:26:32.240000::Yeah, I don't think they like to be called that.
0:26:32.240000 - 0:26:35.920000::But yeah, you can cradle a donkey ass.
0:26:35.920000 - 0:26:38.880000::And even a monitor lizard likes to be cradled.
0:26:38.880000 - 0:26:42.080000::And so I assume the Venn diagram for likes to be cradled
0:26:42.080000 - 0:26:44.880000::and likes raspberries is pretty.
0:26:44.880000 - 0:26:47.760000::There's a strong overlap there, I would say.
0:26:47.760000 - 0:26:51.360000::So we should start trying out raspberries on different type of animals.
0:26:51.360000 - 0:26:53.360000::Oh, but that's when you have to be on a buzz.
0:26:53.440000 - 0:26:55.680000::Be careful, man, because there's oh bugs.
0:26:55.680000 - 0:26:58.640000::Well, you don't want to go up to the wrong mosquito
0:26:58.640000 - 0:27:00.400000::and try and raspberry that thing,
0:27:00.400000 - 0:27:02.800000::because it'll get you right on the dongle and the back of your thing.
0:27:05.440000 - 0:27:09.520000::They're probably so pissed off that they can't experience that from us,
0:27:09.520000 - 0:27:10.400000::because they're too tiny.
0:27:11.440000 - 0:27:12.640000::I know, I know.
0:27:12.640000 - 0:27:16.400000::Do you know that there's a new spider that has invaded New York City that is eight
0:27:16.400000 - 0:27:17.040000::inches big?
0:27:18.880000 - 0:27:19.680000::Good.
0:27:19.680000 - 0:27:21.040000::Our what is that?
0:27:21.040000 - 0:27:24::It can fly around like spider-man on webs.
0:27:24.960000 - 0:27:25.840000::No, it can't.
0:27:25.840000 - 0:27:26.720000::No, it can't.
0:27:26.720000 - 0:27:27.360000::Yes, it can.
0:27:27.360000 - 0:27:28.480000::I swear, it's like spider-man.
0:27:28.480000 - 0:27:30.080000::It has the powers to shoot webs.
0:27:30.080000 - 0:27:31.120000::Eight inches.
0:27:31.120000 - 0:27:32.320000::It's a eight inch.
0:27:32.320000 - 0:27:34.720000::It's legs can go familiar with that size.
0:27:38.960000 - 0:27:41.040000::I've seen things bigger than that.
0:27:42.960000 - 0:27:44.800000::So then anyways, yeah, it can have,
0:27:44.800000 - 0:27:47.280000::it's legs can get up to four inches.
0:27:47.280000 - 0:27:50.080000::And so when you go from one leg to the other end
0:27:50.080000 - 0:27:55.680000::of a different leg rather, that thing can get up to eight inches here.
0:27:58.160000 - 0:28:00::And do it bite?
0:28:00 - 0:28:00.560000::It bite.
0:28:02.720000 - 0:28:04.160000::It does it really?
0:28:04.160000 - 0:28:08.640000::It bites and it can give you basically a six day flu.
0:28:08.640000 - 0:28:09.520000::And there's no cure.
0:28:10.480000 - 0:28:11.760000::You need to be hospitalized.
0:28:11.760000 - 0:28:12.320000::What?
0:28:12.320000 - 0:28:14.240000::And they have just invaded New York City.
0:28:15.360000 - 0:28:16.400000::No, yes.
0:28:17.360000 - 0:28:19.280000::So I got out at the right time.
0:28:19.280000 - 0:28:19.840000::Good.
0:28:19.840000 - 0:28:20.080000::Good.
0:28:20.080000 - 0:28:21.200000::No, I'm just kidding.
0:28:21.200000 - 0:28:22::They're not poisonous.
0:28:23.840000 - 0:28:25.120000::But they are real.
0:28:25.120000 - 0:28:26.480000::But they are real.
0:28:26.480000 - 0:28:27.760000::And I do want to see one.
0:28:29.120000 - 0:28:31.360000::And I do want to teach you the fucking lesson.
0:28:31.360000 - 0:28:33.200000::Hey, man, welcome to New York.
0:28:33.200000 - 0:28:35.360000::You saw what we did to those lanternflies, right?
0:28:36.960000 - 0:28:38.880000::I don't see those fuckers walking around.
0:28:38.880000 - 0:28:40.080000::But this year, do I?
0:28:41.200000 - 0:28:42.720000::I haven't seen one lanternfly.
0:28:42.720000 - 0:28:43.280000::I guess why?
0:28:43.280000 - 0:28:46.240000::Because I was crunching them with the AK-47 on my shoes.
0:28:47.200000 - 0:28:49.600000::Uh-huh, the AK-47, I can re-box.
0:28:49.600000 - 0:28:50.160000::That's right.
0:28:51.840000 - 0:28:53.360000::The air, the AK-47.
0:28:53.360000 - 0:28:54.960000::I never crushed them.
0:28:54.960000 - 0:28:59.120000::I never crushed those flies because I don't like extinguishing life as such.
0:29:01.120000 - 0:29:02.160000::Well, it's such a way.
0:29:02.800000 - 0:29:08.800000::There's going to come a time when you are going to have to kill somebody, a human being,
0:29:08.800000 - 0:29:10.160000::who you like a lot.
0:29:11.760000 - 0:29:13.040000::Very soon, too.
0:29:13.040000 - 0:29:15.600000::I don't know who, but it's going to be soon.
0:29:15.600000 - 0:29:17.520000::And it's going to have to do with your migraines.
0:29:18.080000 - 0:29:23.280000::And you're going to have to explain it in court about why it was going to be activated against
0:29:23.280000 - 0:29:23.840000::the Lensky.
0:29:24.480000 - 0:29:27.840000::You're going to be activated against the Lensky, and you're going to kill an Uber drug.
0:29:27.840000 - 0:29:29.120000::Against my will by Kim.
0:29:32.240000 - 0:29:32.880000::Zalensky!
0:29:36.320000 - 0:29:38::Like you have a scenario.
0:29:38.800000 - 0:29:39.840000::Well, what is it?
0:29:39.840000 - 0:29:40.400000::The odds.
0:29:41.520000 - 0:29:45.520000::Eric, you are on a desert desert island.
0:29:48.960000 - 0:29:52.640000::Oh, yes, there's no cupcakes on this island.
0:29:52.640000 - 0:29:54.080000::Likersh tree.
0:29:54.080000 - 0:29:55.040000::No, no, no.
0:29:55.840000 - 0:29:57.680000::The penguins made out of likersh tree.

0:30:00 - 0:30:04.400000::I am your only source of food on the island.
0:30:04.400000 - 0:30:06.720000::You have to kill me or you die.
0:30:07.760000 - 0:30:12.480000::What do you, and if you kill me and you eat me, all right,
0:30:12.480000 - 0:30:16.360000::that's going to give you the sort of 10 days that you need
0:30:16.360000 - 0:30:19.240000::before a helicopter comes in and saves your life.
0:30:19.240000 - 0:30:21.720000::But one of us has to go, are you going to,
0:30:21.720000 - 0:30:23.320000::are you going to eat my ass and kill me?
0:30:23.320000 - 0:30:26.040000::Are you, are you going to die with me like a real friend?
0:30:26.040000 - 0:30:27.360000::I would kill myself.
0:30:27.360000 - 0:30:29.560000::Immediately if that was a scenario I knew about,
0:30:29.560000 - 0:30:34.760000::I would take that sharp coconut and it for myself and myself
0:30:34.760000 - 0:30:36.640000::from the palm tree,
0:30:36.640000 - 0:30:37.960000::I would get the blood out and let it,
0:30:38.800000 - 0:30:43.320000::like you would do a deer and let you like and feast all up on my ass
0:30:43.320000 - 0:30:46.880000::because I know I would last a lot longer than you would just
0:30:46.880000 - 0:30:48.720000::because of muscle density and sort of.
0:30:50.160000 - 0:30:51.360000::That's a good point, but.
0:30:52.520000 - 0:30:53.280000::How it's going?
0:30:53.440000 - 0:30:54.120000::I think it's right.
0:30:56.440000 - 0:30:57.440000::Those sharp coconuts,
0:30:57.440000 - 0:30:58.600000::that type of friend I am.
0:30:59.040000 - 0:31:01.320000::I thought well, you have to carve the coconut.
0:31:01.360000 - 0:31:02.640000::No, no, no, they're growing.
0:31:02.640000 - 0:31:03.800000::I think I heard.
0:31:04.600000 - 0:31:05::Oh, sure.
0:31:05 - 0:31:07.880000::I was, I was eating you immediately.
0:31:07.880000 - 0:31:09.880000::Like there would be no, there would be like one,
0:31:09.880000 - 0:31:13.600000::three death, second between you killing yourself and me just go
0:31:13.600000 - 0:31:15.600000::and just fucking raw all eating.
0:31:16.320000 - 0:31:17.800000::Oh, brother, I'll do that.
0:31:17.800000 - 0:31:19.560000::I was doing that on a flight today.
0:31:19.560000 - 0:31:20.320000::I was on the flight.
0:31:20.320000 - 0:31:22.880000::There was some turbulence and I took out some Buffalo Wild Wings
0:31:22.880000 - 0:31:24.680000::Asian Zang sauce out of my pocket.
0:31:24.680000 - 0:31:26.720000::Just put it on the dudes wrist just in case we.
0:31:27.720000 - 0:31:28.440000::Went down.
0:31:29.760000 - 0:31:30.520000::Comment.
0:31:30.520000 - 0:31:30.800000::Is it called?
0:31:30.800000 - 0:31:32.600000::Is it really called Asian Zang?
0:31:32.920000 - 0:31:33.720000::Asian Zing.
0:31:35.200000 - 0:31:36::I know exactly.
0:31:36 - 0:31:36.760000::You're talking about that.
0:31:36.760000 - 0:31:37.840000::Also crazy.
0:31:38.160000 - 0:31:38.760000::Wait, sorry.
0:31:38.760000 - 0:31:39.240000::I didn't.

0:43:36.480000 - 0:43:42.240000::a lot of one way to do. I'm nauseous. Of course, there's a lot of knowledge. We need to keep doing
0:43:42.240000 - 0:43:48.240000::reenactments to remember people. What that shit looked like. More video games. Please more World

0:44:02.240000 - 0:44:09.680000::way for quite a while. Because I'm going to spin each air and I was well, I'll have to watch it back.

0:45:47.600000 - 0:45:53.320000::Joetectics. But do you feel like if you were a blindfold to a casino that you
0:45:53.320000 - 0:45:57.160000::would actually scare the dealer wouldn't that be kind of sick.
0:45:57.160000 - 0:46:00.760000::That was smells so fucking good Tom Ford Clunch.

0:46:05.320000 - 0:46:10::destroy the black deck table every single night. That would be a harrowing side.
0:46:10 - 0:46:14.360000::The deepest v neck in the world that goes down to your mother fucking dangling.
0:46:14.360000 - 0:46:16.320000::Okay, testing.

0:46:29.760000 - 0:46:34.080000::People were kind of well in the 2000s.
0:46:34.080000 - 0:46:37.760000::I think people were kind of pulling down the front of their pants a little more
0:46:37.760000 - 0:46:41.120000::to show them what they call the pubis.
0:46:41.120000 - 0:46:43.680000::Funny enough there were no pubes on them back then.
0:46:43.680000 - 0:46:46.720000::But you know, I'm saying I wonder if we should start being a little more sexy.
0:46:46.720000 - 0:46:48.280000::Start kind of pulling that shit.
0:46:48.280000 - 0:46:51.840000::I'm going to try the I'm going to try wearing like crop t-shirts and then
0:46:51.840000 - 0:46:56.720000::like have maybe a quarter of my pubes just hanging over some jeans.
0:46:56.720000 - 0:47:01.200000::You're so you're so it's like your stomach is hilarious.
0:47:01.200000 - 0:47:02.200000::Everything's out there.

0:47:19.080000 - 0:47:23.720000::Like as much as I could without straight razoring it, you know, and it looks it looks
0:47:23.720000 - 0:47:28.520000::just so odd like all of my business area except for.

0:49:44.480000 - 0:49:45.480000::Of course.
0:49:45.480000 - 0:49:47.480000::Yeah, yeah, I'm not.
0:49:47.480000 - 0:49:49.480000::I've never washed a damn vegetable.
0:49:49.480000 - 0:49:50.480000::No, Nate.
0:49:50.480000 - 0:49:52.720000::No, I could have guessed that.
0:49:52.720000 - 0:49:55.760000::Well, I guess I've ran some, well, this is what I'm saying.
0:49:55.760000 - 0:49:59.920000::I've ran water over that, you know, you're talking about Don dish soap.

0:50:00 - 0:50:06.280000::washing. I'm talking about, you know, bleaching my, like, you know, I'm saying, like, you
0:50:06.280000 - 0:50:10.800000::are saying you bring the berries home and you put them in a bowl of water with white vinegar,
0:50:10.800000 - 0:50:15.360000::whatever. And you let them soak exactly. And then you put them in a tougher way.
0:50:15.360000 - 0:50:19.520000::Or you're supposed to do that. Now that's extra. No, I'll just rinse them with some water,
0:50:19.520000 - 0:50:25.320000::you know, but that is a do shit. You think the pesticides, it rains on these fucking things,
0:50:25.320000 - 0:50:33.800000::dude. You think that's, I just, I don't know what the time that I would lose from a disease
0:50:33.800000 - 0:50:39.880000::because I'm going young versus the time that I would lose spending every minute of my life
0:50:40.600000 - 0:50:46.200000::dedicated to fighting the war on bleach. There's nothing I could do. It's no, it's a lose,
0:50:46.200000 - 0:50:56.440000::man. Right. Yeah. The reason I'm running water over it is just because think about the people,
0:50:56.440000 - 0:51:01.560000::how many hands have touched these, right? You have the farmers that are touching them. Okay.
0:51:01.560000 - 0:51:06.840000::Then you have the handlers that are touching them. Then you have all sorts of grocery store,
0:51:08.440000 - 0:51:14.120000::what you call customers touching them. Now that's what begins to discuss me. I just want to get a
0:51:14.120000 - 0:51:19.960000::little bit of that nasty film off. But the pesticides, yeah, I've made my peace. That's just part of
0:51:19.960000 - 0:51:25.080000::me now. Yeah. They should be called tomicides because they're doing way with the humans.
0:51:27.320000 - 0:51:32.360000::Also, can I say, I just, I feel like I just now adapted fully to the blindness of
0:51:33.160000 - 0:51:38.440000::really? I feel like it was the first, like, whatever, 45 minutes I was kind of like, how do I,
0:51:38.440000 - 0:51:43.160000::you know, I was having some mic issues. I was, yeah, I'm locked in. I feel like I could go through,
0:51:43.160000 - 0:51:50.040000::I could go four hours like this right now in this current state, but it's so curious how long it
0:51:50.040000 - 0:51:57.640000::takes to adapt adapting is instantaneous. Is it adaption takes time and people don't like to,
0:51:57.880000 - 0:52:03.720000::people don't like to, um, that's right. And if I can just keep it real, I've had the opposite
0:52:03.720000 - 0:52:09.160000::feeling to wear in the past 30 seconds. The panic has begun to set in a little bit.
0:52:09.160000 - 0:52:15.640000::Yeah. Yeah. I feel really nauseous. And I was actually going to propose that we take these off
0:52:15.640000 - 0:52:19.960000::for the last couple of minutes here. Let's do it. Let's do it. Please.
0:52:19.960000 - 0:52:24.600000::God, you account down. Account down. Oh, it's all right. Three, two, one, go. You already
0:52:25.640000 - 0:52:34.760000::three, two, one, go. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, my God. Oh, shit.
0:52:35.080000 - 0:52:42.680000::It's so great. That was, I can't believe we just done this. Hey, hold on a second.
0:52:42.680000 - 0:52:47::I can't believe it. I'm just walked in just now. You know who I look like.
0:52:47 - 0:52:53.240000::I'm the head potter tip. I look like Professor Quirl. Remember him.
0:52:53.240000 - 0:52:57.800000::Yeah. I've been given an amazing hairstyle from my hat.
0:52:57.800000 - 0:53:03.160000::You've got a punk rock. I have style. I've got the stalactite on my forehead.
0:53:03.160000 - 0:53:09.800000::Hey, you look like a guy who just like was on. You look like you were like the first person to
0:53:09.800000 - 0:53:19.480000::get eliminated on like survivor. Wow. Remember you unanimously voted you out.
0:53:19.480000 - 0:53:26.520000::That is a good one. That was very artistically accurate.
0:53:28.120000 - 0:53:32.040000::Well, I suppose we should get into it. I guess we should get into the door.
0:53:33.160000 - 0:53:39.960000::Oh, I see what you're saying. That sucked. I just want to say that that was emotionally a joy,
0:53:39.960000 - 0:53:47.240000::but I feel pretty nauseous. Where we get into the joy, I have a, I have a question for the listeners
0:53:47.240000 - 0:53:54.680000::because our listeners are some of the most technologically advanced people on the planet.
0:53:54.680000 - 0:54:01.880000::And I really do need a recommendation. I'm switching up. I have a 2017 MacBook Pro. Okay.
0:54:02.760000 - 0:54:06.680000::And this thing is fucking shitting out on me every fucking goddamn day.
0:54:06.680000 - 0:54:13.640000::And I'm thinking about moving over to the PC gang, which I'm no stranger to. Okay.
0:54:14.360000 - 0:54:21.800000::And I'm thinking about getting a PC gaming laptop. So if anybody has recommendations for me
0:54:21.800000 - 0:54:27.880000::for something that is a powerhouse fucking laptop with the top Nvidia chip AI,
0:54:28.760000 - 0:54:36.840000::whatever gaming G4, sphucking chip in it, that can also handle a Dolby Premiere Photoshop
0:54:36.840000 - 0:54:41.160000::and all the other types of crazy other apps that I use. Let my ass know.
0:54:42.280000 - 0:54:43.320000::Because I'm in the market.
0:54:44.120000 - 0:54:48.200000::Burn you laptop. Because I want to play steam games with my friends.
0:54:51.080000 - 0:54:57.480000::Sims 3. All right. That was Nate. So that was the
0:54:57.480000 - 0:54:59.880000::official little I just had that Nate.

0:55:00 - 0:55:04.480000::Tech corner Nate's tech help corner. If you do, Nate's gonna
0:55:04.480000 - 0:55:05.880000::go to the cell phone number.
0:55:09.760000 - 0:55:10.440000::Okay.
0:55:10.560000 - 0:55:14.360000::And now with regards to joy. Is that what you're about to say?
0:55:15.920000 - 0:55:18.400000::He was about to say that exact sentence. Yes.
0:55:19.320000 - 0:55:22::Well, I'll go ahead.
0:55:22.920000 - 0:55:26.080000::What is giving me guess? Let me break in guess.
0:55:26.920000 - 0:55:27.960000::We're going back to last.
