0:12:07.160000 - 0:12:08.160000::Okay.
0:12:08.160000 - 0:12:10.720000::Not because it was too hard, and I couldn't beat that guy that was sitting on that fat

0:12:37.840000 - 0:12:39.840000::That game ruined.
0:12:39.840000 - 0:12:46.680000::I think I'm still, I think I'm maybe I just now recovered from the post Elden Ring, like
0:12:46.680000 - 0:12:53.360000::Hayes, that I was, because that game, I haven't played a game like that since I was in

0:13:06.320000 - 0:13:07.320000::And it, it totally ruined.
0:13:07.320000 - 0:13:08.320000::What were you doing, Nate?

0:13:13.320000 - 0:13:14.320000::It's a hard game.
0:13:14.320000 - 0:13:15.320000::What do you mean was, I didn't know.
0:13:15.320000 - 0:13:16.320000::It is, Jack.
0:13:16.480000 - 0:13:21.480000::It's a hardest game that's ever been, I'm playing these fucking, uh, uh, Legend of Zelda,
0:13:21.480000 - 0:13:23.160000::man, I'm playing games for kids, dude.
0:13:23.160000 - 0:13:25.480000::I'm not even a gamer, I haven't roasted that shit.
0:13:25.480000 - 0:13:27::Thrice, and you know how?
0:13:27 - 0:13:28.680000::What do you mean you're not a gamer, dude?
0:13:28.680000 - 0:13:30.280000::You're, you're the ultimate brother.
0:13:30.280000 - 0:13:32.720000::I never played none of these games that y'all are playing.
0:13:32.720000 - 0:13:37.040000::I never played, I played Tony Hawk, I played skate three, and I've played hundreds of
0:13:37.040000 - 0:13:41.280000::thousand hours and all that, played Halo, hundreds of thousands of hours, runescape, hundreds
0:13:41.280000 - 0:13:43.960000::of thousand hours, but gaming, you know what I'm saying?
0:13:43.960000 - 0:13:45.560000::Like, yo, did you get this new game?
0:13:45.600000 - 0:13:49.800000::I don't game like that, but y'all convinced me to get out of the ring.
0:13:49.800000 - 0:13:50.800000::You tricked me.
0:13:50.800000 - 0:13:54.200000::But I'll say this, I'll say this, you might have been able to beat that game, but you
0:13:54.200000 - 0:13:55.880000::could never defeat reading the hobbit.
0:13:56.720000 - 0:13:57.720000::Why would you say that?
0:13:57.720000 - 0:13:59.200000::I can listen to it.
0:13:59.840000 - 0:14:00.840000::I can listen to it.
0:14:00.840000 - 0:14:01.840000::True.
0:14:01.840000 - 0:14:02.840000::That's true.
0:14:02.840000 - 0:14:03.840000::That's true.
0:14:03.840000 - 0:14:08.360000::But listen, I'm sorry to have gotten down on you like that, but I just feel sort of defensive
0:14:08.360000 - 0:14:09.360000::right now.
0:14:09.360000 - 0:14:10.360000::Okay, man.
0:14:10.360000 - 0:14:13.400000::I know that it's clear that night and I really tried and you came over and beat that
0:14:13.400000 - 0:14:17.360000::ox for me, but here's the thing and that advanced me in the game, but I didn't even
0:14:17.360000 - 0:14:21.440000::care after that because I know I didn't actually get what you had to enlist jack like
0:14:21.440000 - 0:14:25::Jack had to help me be one of these damn guard.
0:14:25 - 0:14:27::It wasn't even a boss guy on a horse.
0:14:27 - 0:14:29.320000::One of these damn guy on a horse.
0:14:30.360000 - 0:14:33.840000::He's no, he's blocking the capital city and he's quite difficult to defeat.
0:14:34.280000 - 0:14:41.680000::But what's funny is, no, the truth is the truth is guys that you both are farther along
0:14:41.680000 - 0:14:50.160000::in the game than I am if you're listening to God because I cheated crazy.
0:14:50.160000 - 0:14:52.800000::The whole I cheated to you.
0:14:52.800000 - 0:14:54.120000::Did you cheese that shit?
0:14:54.120000 - 0:14:55.120000::I cheesed.
0:14:55.120000 - 0:14:56.600000::I fucking I griared it.
0:14:56.600000 - 0:14:57.880000::My partner's on it.
0:14:57.880000 - 0:14:59.720000::I pack a renew on with that shit.
0:14:59.720000 - 0:15:00::I did.

0:15:00 - 0:15:03::I would find to just get through it.
0:15:03 - 0:15:07::But then I went back in the game.
0:15:07 - 0:15:11.800000::Gaming is so, you know, my PS5 is not with me right now.
0:15:11.800000 - 0:15:12.560000::OK.
0:15:12.560000 - 0:15:17.400000::It's being driven out here from New York.
0:15:17.400000 - 0:15:20.560000::And I'm going to go see it in about 10 days.
0:15:20.560000 - 0:15:23.040000::And then I'll drive it back here from Dallas.
0:15:23.040000 - 0:15:25.680000::But I miss it.
0:15:25.680000 - 0:15:28.560000::I've missed that type of gaming, turning that time on.
0:15:28.560000 - 0:15:29.060000::Yeah.
0:15:29.060000 - 0:15:32.340000::And going crazy with the controller in my hand.
0:15:32.340000 - 0:15:33.740000::It just feels so good.
0:15:33.740000 - 0:15:35.100000::You know what I mean?
0:15:35.100000 - 0:15:37.620000::So many good games I've played throughout my life.
0:15:37.620000 - 0:15:38.980000::I can't even remember them all.
0:15:38.980000 - 0:15:40.940000::Someone asked me other day, what's your favorite game?
0:15:40.940000 - 0:15:43.220000::I can barely remember what I played.
0:15:43.220000 - 0:15:45.380000::But I know I've had an amazing time.

0:16:06.780000 - 0:16:08.620000::I was kind of moved by that monologue there.

0:16:14.820000 - 0:16:17.340000::or Rizdi or whatever right now.

0:16:31.060000 - 0:16:32.900000::It just says, Zelda has never clicked with me.
0:16:32.900000 - 0:16:33.500000::I hate to say that.
0:16:33.500000 - 0:16:34.140000::Are you kidding me?
0:16:34.140000 - 0:16:34.540000::What about the horror on?

0:17:50.380000 - 0:17:53.100000::They said that dark link exists, but I'm pretty sure

0:19:47.900000 - 0:19:50.500000::And just sending that shit, doing the Jesus bugger,

0:20:27.320000 - 0:20:30.120000::And I get a of course gauntlet legends.
0:20:30.120000 - 0:20:34.800000::That was so majestic to me because you couldn't at the when it first came out it was only

0:22:23.080000 - 0:22:26.120000::I haven't thought about this game in years.
0:22:26.120000 - 0:22:27.120000::Okay.
0:22:27.120000 - 0:22:29.320000::And there's not much more that needs to be said about it.
0:22:29.320000 - 0:22:30.560000::But if you can find it.
0:22:30.560000 - 0:22:34.200000::I mean later I've been playing it was I remember it being pretty fun when I was about seven
0:22:34.200000 - 0:22:35.200000::years old.

0:22:40.440000 - 0:22:43.120000::No, I never even heard of that going on man.
0:22:43.120000 - 0:22:44.120000::Going on man.
0:22:44.120000 - 0:22:47.440000::You want to ask me what it is?
0:22:47.440000 - 0:22:48.440000::What is it?
0:22:48.440000 - 0:22:50.720000::Full sentence.
0:22:50.720000 - 0:22:51.720000::What is going on man?
0:22:51.720000 - 0:22:52.720000::What is going on?

0:22:56.520000 - 0:23:01.520000::You know dude, if you trick people enough like that for a long enough period of time you're
0:23:01.520000 - 0:23:04.360000::going to lose all the trust that you have.
0:23:04.360000 - 0:23:05.360000::So be it man.
0:23:05.360000 - 0:23:06.760000::I heard of the boy who cried wolf.
0:23:06.760000 - 0:23:07.760000::Yeah right.
0:23:07.760000 - 0:23:08.760000::Yeah right.
0:23:08.760000 - 0:23:10.520000::You've heard of that parable in story right?
0:23:10.520000 - 0:23:12.600000::What if I'm a boy and wolf's clothes?
0:23:12.600000 - 0:23:14.960000::What if I'm a wolf and boy's clothing?
0:23:14.960000 - 0:23:15.960000::See what I'm saying?
0:23:15.960000 - 0:23:17.600000::I am a wolf's clothing.
0:23:17.600000 - 0:23:21.600000::I was born to lose trust.
0:23:21.600000 - 0:23:22.920000::That's a game to you isn't it?
0:23:22.920000 - 0:23:24.600000::Getting losing trust and building it back.
0:23:24.600000 - 0:23:27::That's just a game to you isn't it?
0:23:27 - 0:23:28::That is right.
0:23:28 - 0:23:29::To your game.
0:23:29 - 0:23:30::Yeah.

0:23:33 - 0:23:34::Sorry.
0:23:34 - 0:23:37.560000::Okay, let's go through some of the top game franchises.
0:23:37.560000 - 0:23:40.680000::This is what the, what everybody wants to hear about.
0:23:40.680000 - 0:23:41.680000::Mass Effect.
0:23:41.680000 - 0:23:44.600000::What's that?
0:23:44.600000 - 0:23:47.200000::You guys never played Mass Effect.
0:23:47.200000 - 0:23:49.680000::I've never played, I don't think I played a single game.
0:23:49.680000 - 0:23:50.680000::You're kidding me.
0:23:50.680000 - 0:23:51.680000::Oh my god.
0:23:51.680000 - 0:23:56.280000::Nate never played a one of those games on that list except for maybe one of them.
0:23:56.280000 - 0:23:57.520000::Resident Evil 4.
0:23:57.520000 - 0:23:58.520000::I'm getting sad.
0:23:58.520000 - 0:23:59.520000::I'm getting sad.
0:23:59.520000 - 0:24:00.520000::What's that?
0:24:00.520000 - 0:24:01.520000::Resident Evil 4.
0:24:01.520000 - 0:24:02.520000::Oh my god.
0:24:02.520000 - 0:24:06.240000::Well you know the, I'm getting disturbed that you guys aren't hopping on the saying,
0:24:06.240000 - 0:24:07.240000::yo, yo.
0:24:07.240000 - 0:24:09.680000::Well of course I've played fucking Resident Evil.
0:24:09.680000 - 0:24:10.680000::Alright.
0:24:10.680000 - 0:24:11.680000::Bio shock.
0:24:11.680000 - 0:24:13.880000::I've heard these words before.
0:24:13.880000 - 0:24:20.080000::Of course I've heard these words I'm cultured but I don't, I never.
0:24:20.080000 - 0:24:22::These are like prestige games.
0:24:22 - 0:24:28.280000::Like, like video games are trying to be okay one.
0:24:28.280000 - 0:24:32.760000::The video games are doing the thing that's like that movies are doing where they're trying
0:24:32.760000 - 0:24:39.360000::to remake Final Fantasy 7 like three times or something like.
0:24:39.360000 - 0:24:40.360000::Yeah.
0:24:40.560000 - 0:24:43.480000::I think we're in it.
0:24:43.480000 - 0:24:49.520000::We're just culturally at a point where we just can't come up with new things.
0:24:49.520000 - 0:24:52.760000::You think we're in the dark ages creatively because of what's on the media?
0:24:52.760000 - 0:24:53.760000::I think.
0:24:53.760000 - 0:24:54.760000::Well, I think.
0:24:54.760000 - 0:24:55.760000::Can I say that?
0:24:55.760000 - 0:24:56.760000::Can I name this era?
0:24:56.760000 - 0:24:58.600000::Yeah, of course.
0:24:58.600000 - 0:24:59.920000::We are in an age.

0:25:00 - 0:25:08.400000::of media fear. We are in an age of creative doubt as a race, as a species rather.
0:25:09.600000 - 0:25:14.320000::And human race, right as a human race, not as chill. But what I'm saying is
0:25:16.720000 - 0:25:22.480000::people can't people have enjoyed so much what has been done in our lives. You see the Titanic.
0:25:22.480000 - 0:25:27.280000::You go James Cameron's watching, you know, he watches back Titanic goes, God, how the fuck did I do that shit?
0:25:27.840000 - 0:25:33.200000::That probably wasn't me. I can't never do that shit again. And then and humanity were saying, well,
0:25:33.200000 - 0:25:37.280000::then this remake it, let's do this. But we have to learn from James Cameron and say, fuck it.
0:25:37.280000 - 0:25:43.680000::I'm going to sink 20 years into make an underwater avatar and just try again. And just try because you
0:25:43.680000 - 0:25:49.120000::can do it. That's what I want to tell you. You can't get the magic back though, not from the magic.
0:25:49.120000 - 0:25:56.240000::Is there you can always the fire has never gone and just needs to be real it. Okay. Fire will always
0:25:56.240000 - 0:26:05.120000::exist in potentiality of energy. Fire is a we need to set a fire a blaze amongst the children,
0:26:05.120000 - 0:26:10.480000::I think, because guess what? We're our generation is a lost cause. Who's who's a young director right
0:26:10.480000 - 0:26:19.280000::now? 30 years old area of age. That's correct. Oh, name, name somebody. I'll wait. Name one. I'll wait.
0:26:20.080000 - 0:26:26.160000::Who's the next? In America? In America, no, I can't. Right. In America. But if you talk
0:26:26.160000 - 0:26:35.200000::in Italy and all the rest, there's plenty. Sure. But American media is crumbling. The older generations
0:26:35.200000 - 0:26:42.400000::are giving nothing to the young and film and TV and video games are suffering because of that.
0:26:43.120000 - 0:26:48.640000::Give us a fucking chance to all the boomers listening to this shit that are in positions of power.
0:26:48.720000 - 0:26:52.720000::Give the younger generations a chance now. Because it's a chance, man.
0:26:55.040000 - 0:27:01.120000::I'm just yeah, agree. Oh, you said just give us a chance. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. I just yeah, I agree.
0:27:02.160000 - 0:27:07.760000::Because they're going to die soon, man. So what they need to know is one way or another. That's
0:27:07.760000 - 0:27:15.440000::hard to hear. But one way or another, if whether you give us that bag or whether we have to take that
0:27:15.440000 - 0:27:22.480000::bag out of your cold day, with bats, bats with nails in them. Maybe just natural causes,
0:27:22.480000 - 0:27:27.360000::version of that, bats and nails, but I know. I know someone from my high school. That was,
0:27:27.360000 - 0:27:32.400000::I think I told you guys. We yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Killed that one. Yeah, that's a little personal.
0:27:33.840000 - 0:27:45.040000::But what else? Oh, Joe Biden reminded of what is the, the, I guess the notion
0:27:45.440000 - 0:27:52.560000::I mean, we're we're talking about notions. Right. There we go. The notion of Jack is, Jack's getting
0:27:52.560000 - 0:28:00.960000::spared. I'm getting ready to receive the sentence and analyze it. The notion of world building. Wow.
0:28:01.760000 - 0:28:08.400000::Okay. Which could be a whole other fucking topic. Oh, world building. World building. By the way,
0:28:08.400000 - 0:28:13.760000::is a gift. It's not something that you can learn. Okay. Right. No one can teach you world building.
0:28:14.400000 - 0:28:20.640000::Us creatives who were bullied our entire childhoods and lived in prison. Our bodies were more
0:28:20.640000 - 0:28:27.120000::like prisons because of the weight and the and the lack of coordination. We were forced to build
0:28:27.120000 - 0:28:34.320000::worlds in our minds. Okay. Beautiful worlds, lush worlds, desert worlds, space worlds, fantasy worlds,
0:28:35.040000 - 0:28:43.280000::sexual worlds. Okay. And to all you account managers out there who have the the sea gutters,
0:28:43.280000 - 0:28:47.280000::you know what I'm talking about? And you got the eight packs and you eat fucking sweet green
0:28:47.280000 - 0:28:52.960000::every day and you have over $300,000. You will never know how to world build like we learned how to.
0:28:52.960000 - 0:28:59.840000::You could never come up with the with the with the concept of a Italian plumber who hates turtles.
0:29:00.800000 - 0:29:06.640000::That is not right. Right. That is not even close. Imagine being in the mouth of that guy who created
0:29:06.640000 - 0:29:10.960000::that you wouldn't want to for a second because it's so horrible in there. You're in a minute. Japanese.
0:29:12.640000 - 0:29:17.280000::Well, right. Right. And you know what all these games have in common. There is just one
0:29:18.160000 - 0:29:27.680000::singular vision probably most of the time it's a Japanese guy. Okay. Psychotic Japanese fella. Yeah,
0:29:27.680000 - 0:29:33.120000::right. He's thinking of it. Thinking up this shit. Right. So shout out to all those Japanese males out
0:29:33.120000 - 0:29:38.560000::there that are just putting it down that are just who were supported by females and probably
0:29:38.560000 - 0:29:43.440000::stealing from them. That's what I was going to say stealing from the women. I'm sure the Japanese
0:29:43.440000 - 0:29:49.040000::women. Well, if you go and look at ancient Japanese female art, you will see cave cave sculptures of
0:29:49.040000 - 0:29:55.360000::little goombas and Mario figures. You know what I'm saying? Jack at Jack, I feel like you you have
0:29:55.360000 - 0:29:59.840000::a little closet. That's all that. What? What? Japanese female art.

0:30:00 - 0:30:02::Let me look at my closet right now.
0:30:03.840000 - 0:30:08.840000::Glock I got a 47 in there. I guess I'll be fine.
0:30:10.360000 - 0:30:13.460000::Oh, remember the woman from Neon Genesis?
0:30:14.560000 - 0:30:22.840000::Even remember the end member will because she was one of the most baddest baddies of all time from animation history.
0:30:23.080000 - 0:30:27.360000::Okay, remember her and then the kid was like, what's the fucking decal on my
0:30:30 - 0:30:32::bed?
0:30:33.360000 - 0:30:39.760000::Oh my god, I will just say shout out to her shout out to her for leading those kids through
0:30:40.560000 - 0:30:44.320000::operating those mechs that save planet. Yeah good for her.
0:30:47.840000 - 0:30:54.800000::So where's this all headed? Wait, oh, oh speaking of world building. If we could pick if you could pick one world
0:30:55.360000 - 0:30:57.360000::One video game
0:30:57.360000 - 0:31:02.120000::Report to and live in for the rest of your days. What would it be sir?
0:31:03.080000 - 0:31:09.480000::And what what would you say would be crazy ass amazing question? I guess it'd be one where my friends and family were
0:31:10.040000 - 0:31:12.040000::Otherwise, I don't know how I would
0:31:12.480000 - 0:31:14.480000::Deal with it
0:31:14.760000 - 0:31:21.760000::No, you don't get to see them. You go in and it's all gone. Okay, that sounds pretty tough
0:31:21.760000 - 0:31:26.160000::You have to make new friends. Yep, a new family with all right
0:31:28.280000 - 0:31:32.280000::Honestly, I would probably go you know what you mentioned this game, but

0:47:11.960000 - 0:47:16.280000::Otherwise, you're just going to lose your connection to the to the internet frankly

0:53:53.240000 - 0:53:57.440000::We think NPR stands for Nancy Pellier radio

0:54:24 - 0:54:27.680000::I will start off by saying I went on a
0:54:28.280000 - 0:54:34.560000::I think this was whatever this week went on a hike with with Eric and our friend Max. Yeah, and
0:54:35.360000 - 0:54:37.960000::As you know, my back is all fucked up and
0:54:39.560000 - 0:54:45.520000::And I was kind of nervous about it and hadn't gone at this pace before and
0:54:46.320000 - 0:54:48.320000::We got up to the top
0:54:48.320000 - 0:54:52.400000::Got down to the bottom. No, no issue. No pain giving me confidence
0:54:52.960000 - 0:54:56.760000::to do more physical activities with my back
0:54:58.240000 - 0:55:00.040000::So that's what gave me joy is big

0:55:00 - 0:55:02.440000::basically the hope of the future.
0:55:02.440000 - 0:55:03.240000::Wow, man.
0:55:04.120000 - 0:55:06.440000::Yeah. That is amazing.
0:55:06.440000 - 0:55:11.120000::It was, and Nate was moving at a rapid pace.
0:55:11.120000 - 0:55:13.640000::If you could have seen him, it would have been
0:55:13.640000 - 0:55:16.680000::watching a damn blur moving across that mountain.
0:55:18.560000 - 0:55:21.720000::I watched a documentary.
0:55:21.720000 - 0:55:23.880000::Oops, sound familiar.
0:55:23.880000 - 0:55:27.440000::I watched another documentary this week called Trekkies.
0:55:27.440000 - 0:55:29.560000::And maybe many people have seen this,
0:55:29.560000 - 0:55:32.600000::but it was like 1997.
0:55:32.600000 - 0:55:35.440000::And it's just, they just don't make people
0:55:35.440000 - 0:55:36.840000::like they made back then.
0:55:36.840000 - 0:55:37.680000::You know what I mean?
0:55:37.680000 - 0:55:40.200000::Because then I watched a follow up that was like 2011.
0:55:40.200000 - 0:55:43.320000::And the magic is somehow gone from watching,
0:55:43.320000 - 0:55:47.760000::like the convention is so much less fun than it looked in 1997.
0:55:47.760000 - 0:55:49.960000::I don't know if that's because they used a film camera
0:55:49.960000 - 0:55:52.680000::or if it's because people pre-internet age
0:55:54.160000 - 0:55:57.400000::or so watch more unique, you know?
0:55:57.400000 - 0:55:58.240000::There's no internet.
0:55:59.080000 - 0:56:00.520000::There's no internet connecting these people.
0:56:00.520000 - 0:56:04.400000::So they had to find it to find another Star Trek fan in the wild.
0:56:04.400000 - 0:56:06.800000::It's like, thank God we got each other.
0:56:06.800000 - 0:56:08.840000::And let's have a crazy convention in F and S,
0:56:08.840000 - 0:56:11.840000::each other all weekend and crazy fucking

0:56:26.800000 - 0:56:27.680000::It's tricky.
0:56:29.120000 - 0:56:29.960000::Beautiful.
0:56:29.960000 - 0:56:30.960000::Jack?
0:56:30.960000 - 0:56:34.960000::Well, well this is, yeah.

0:56:39.640000 - 0:56:44.440000::So yesterday I went to the inside organizer school.
0:56:44.440000 - 0:56:48.280000::This is a school for people who want to learn
0:56:48.280000 - 0:56:52.320000::how to organize their workplace in a union fashion.
0:56:53.240000 - 0:56:56.680000::And I saw my parents there.
0:56:56.680000 - 0:56:59.760000::They did a little session in Manhattan.
0:56:59.760000 - 0:57:04.240000::And a lot of people were there from different unions,
0:57:04.240000 - 0:57:09.280000::people from Barnes and Noble, telling crazy stories.
0:57:09.280000 - 0:57:12.640000::About getting their union started in the crazy British,
0:57:12.640000 - 0:57:16.280000::getting the crazy British CEO who was coming in
0:57:16.280000 - 0:57:20.200000::and thinking he could kind of tell a stop story
0:57:20.200000 - 0:57:22.480000::and get them not to do it.
0:57:22.480000 - 0:57:26.280000::REI, people from there, very cool.
0:57:26.280000 - 0:57:31::And it was fun to eat pizza in a room with a bunch of people
0:57:31 - 0:57:37.320000::and talk about things and life and learn some cool information.
0:57:37.320000 - 0:57:38.520000::I recommend Google in that.
0:57:38.520000 - 0:57:43.520000::If you're interested in shaking things up, of course.
0:57:43.520000 - 0:57:44.440000::And I saw challenges.
0:57:44.440000 - 0:57:47.600000::That shit was crazy.
0:57:47.600000 - 0:57:49.920000::Oh, yeah, yeah.
