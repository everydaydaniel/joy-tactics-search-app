0:01:01 - 0:01:02::Okay.
0:01:02 - 0:01:06::What is the soul name that we're talking about cars?
0:01:06 - 0:01:07::I don't know why.
0:01:07 - 0:01:09::I just because well.
0:01:09 - 0:01:16::In the middle, we just recorded another episode and I went to go get a snack and I saw a car commercial.
0:01:16 - 0:01:22::And I thought, why don't we never really talk about cars like we like to outside of the podcast.
0:01:22 - 0:01:23::Outside of the podcast.
0:01:23 - 0:01:24::On a podcast.
0:01:24 - 0:01:25::So, let's make this whole thing.
0:01:25 - 0:01:34::And it's so interesting how manipulated you are and we are susceptible to advertisements like this.
0:01:34 - 0:01:38::You just saw an ad and you didn't go out and buy a car.
0:01:38 - 0:01:39::Did you?
0:01:39 - 0:01:46::But in a way, you're talking about it and you're re advertising basically the car right now.
0:01:46 - 0:01:49::You're putting words in my mouth, dude.
0:01:49 - 0:01:56::I already was thinking about cars and then that I don't want to get into it.
0:01:56 - 0:01:59::I'm never in watch your time.
0:01:59 - 0:02:09::Sometimes I'm like, I don't know if I'm hungry, but I was listening to that conversation go on between you two and I was like,
0:02:09 - 0:02:12::I'm trying to understand what was happening.
0:02:12 - 0:02:17::Like, as if I was in like English class, if I had to explain like, so what just happened?
0:02:17 - 0:02:19::I think I couldn't do it.
0:02:19 - 0:02:21::Can I say something about English classroom quick?
0:02:21 - 0:02:22::Yeah.
0:02:22 - 0:02:28::Were you guys like this where I remember every time we would get a book to read.
0:02:28 - 0:02:35::And we would have to go home and write some report on this in this chapter.
0:02:35 - 0:02:41::And you would have to kind of talk about what was the meaning of this text.
0:02:41 - 0:02:51::And without a doubt every single time I would have an out of left field meaning of what I thought that this was about.
0:02:51 - 0:02:56::And it never, and I was like, God, this is what the author meant with this.
0:02:56 - 0:02:58::Did it concern your teachers?
0:02:58 - 0:03:01::No, you know what?
0:03:01 - 0:03:03::None of them were concerned.
0:03:03 - 0:03:06::And that's, and that's frightening in and of itself.
0:03:06 - 0:03:11::Well, because you had left brain, left brain skills or what?
0:03:11 - 0:03:15::They could, they should have been encouraging me, I think, to go deep.
0:03:15 - 0:03:17::Maybe they had my own use.
0:03:17 - 0:03:24::It's curious how much a teacher's encouragement can drive a child to succeed.
0:03:24 - 0:03:27::It only takes one.
0:03:27 - 0:03:31::That's when I'm on the street and I see a kid, I just throw out a random subject like,
0:03:31 - 0:03:35::oh, I heard you're good as fuck at division, dividing.
0:03:35 - 0:03:37::And then, and then that becomes their identity.
0:03:37 - 0:03:40::They're like, oh, you must, they must have heard that to the grapevine.
0:03:40 - 0:03:44::And then they become an amazing mathematician.
0:03:44 - 0:03:46::Well, let me say this.
0:03:46 - 0:03:56::Last night at a comedy show, I frequently, a frequent topic of discussion for me is my time spent in special ed classes.
0:03:56 - 0:03:58::Which you shouldn't be embarrassed of.
0:03:58 - 0:04:01::I'm not embarrassed of and I don't know why you didn't say that.
0:04:01 - 0:04:05::You should never be embarrassed of that no matter what people are speaking about you.
0:04:05 - 0:04:06::All right, do your back.
0:04:06 - 0:04:07::Okay, man.
0:04:07 - 0:04:09::And I'm not and I'm not. That's what's funny, man.
0:04:09 - 0:04:10::Good. So drop it.
0:04:10 - 0:04:11::So drop it.
0:04:11 - 0:04:12::So drop it.
0:04:12 - 0:04:13::Let's move on.
0:04:13 - 0:04:14::Okay.
0:04:14 - 0:04:15::Sorry.
0:04:15 - 0:04:16::So that was awkward.
0:04:16 - 0:04:21::But I was doing stand up last night and I'm doing my jokes blah, blah, blah.
0:04:21 - 0:04:25::And somebody comes up to me after the show who was certified on drugs.
0:04:25 - 0:04:26::Who?
0:04:26 - 0:04:29::I can't. I don't know their name.
0:04:29 - 0:04:31::But they seem to be a mutual friend.
0:04:31 - 0:04:32::Awesome.
0:04:32 - 0:04:39::But they were saying like really earnestly like, that's amazing that like you're still able to do this.
0:04:39 - 0:04:42::And like you represent your community like that.
0:04:42 - 0:04:50::I was like, yeah, it did maybe think like I was in special needs classes, but was I special needs?
0:04:50 - 0:04:53::Or did I just have needs that were special?
0:04:53 - 0:04:54::I think that's the latter, dude.
0:04:54 - 0:04:57::No matter what anybody says, I think it's either.
0:04:57 - 0:05:00::I've asked you all about the quotes, right?

0:05:00 - 0:05:05.260000::I used to quote like when you write an essay, you have to put a quote from the book in
0:05:05.260000 - 0:05:07.900000::the essay to support your thing.
0:05:07.900000 - 0:05:13.760000::I know all about that, but nobody clocked that I was doing this throughout high school,
0:05:13.760000 - 0:05:17.620000::but I thought that meant that it had to be within quotation marks.
0:05:17.620000 - 0:05:20.500000::So my quote from the book would always be like, yes.
0:05:20.500000 - 0:05:23.540000::Oh, you look for a literal.
0:05:23.540000 - 0:05:26.680000::Oh, you had to look for the actual quote within the book.
0:05:26.680000 - 0:05:28.680000::That's what I thought that meant.
0:05:28.680000 - 0:05:34.040000::I know everybody just thought that I just was not being.
0:05:34.040000 - 0:05:36.120000::Yeah, I don't know.
0:05:36.120000 - 0:05:38.240000::I could see how that could fly under the radar.
0:05:38.240000 - 0:05:43.080000::You know, you'd be like, you know, yeah, the other jack being fucking.
0:05:43.080000 - 0:05:45.560000::That's a tough one to catch.
0:05:45.560000 - 0:05:47.880000::OK, so let's kick off the car discussion.
0:05:47.880000 - 0:05:49.040000::Let's go.
0:05:49.040000 - 0:05:51.400000::We're going to go around name car brands until we can.
0:05:51.400000 - 0:05:52.400000::Oh, I have.
0:05:52.400000 - 0:05:58.560000::And the first one to stop has to do a spicy challenge.
0:05:58.560000 - 0:06:00.320000::Where you going to do name cars?
0:06:00.320000 - 0:06:01.320000::All right, let's go.
0:06:01.320000 - 0:06:02.400000::All right.
0:06:02.400000 - 0:06:04.960000::Are we doing models or branches brands?
0:06:04.960000 - 0:06:07.160000::Just the brands.
0:06:07.160000 - 0:06:18.880000::OK, I'll start Lexus Toyota Honda Chevy GM.

0:06:29.920000 - 0:06:30.920000::Aren't you?
0:06:30.920000 - 0:06:31.920000::I don't know.
0:06:31.920000 - 0:06:32.920000::I can.
0:06:32.920000 - 0:06:33.920000::OK, so I can.
0:06:33.920000 - 0:06:34.920000::Sob.

0:06:48.440000 - 0:06:49.440000::No.
0:06:49.440000 - 0:06:51.040000::Let me say a different one.
0:06:51.040000 - 0:06:51.880000::Let me say a different one.

0:08:42.040000 - 0:08:43.320000::You'd already said Range Rover.
0:08:43.320000 - 0:08:44.120000::Land Rover.
0:08:44.120000 - 0:08:45.120000::Land Rover.
0:08:45.120000 - 0:08:46.280000::Those are the same thing.
0:08:46.280000 - 0:08:47.560000::No, not.
0:08:47.560000 - 0:08:49.680000::Yeah, a land.
0:08:49.680000 - 0:08:50.680000::They're different.

0:09:08.520000 - 0:09:10.760000::We skipped Eric, didn't we?
0:09:10.760000 - 0:09:11.720000::Oh, I don't know.
0:09:11.720000 - 0:09:13.120000::I said, keep going.
0:09:13.120000 - 0:09:13.960000::Oh, you said keep going.

0:18:46.640000 - 0:18:48.280000::But I don't know how to work on it.
0:18:48.280000 - 0:18:52.280000::I don't know how to mod them or do anything to the engine.
0:18:52.280000 - 0:18:53.280000::You will though.
0:18:53.280000 - 0:18:55.600000::What a mod your car?
0:18:55.600000 - 0:18:59.040000::I put a roll cage in my master three.
0:18:59.040000 - 0:19:00.640000::Remember the roll cages?
0:19:00.640000 - 0:19:01.640000::Hell yeah.
0:19:01.640000 - 0:19:07.080000::I remember getting into like friends older brothers cars and they had the roll cages.
0:19:07.080000 - 0:19:10.960000::And like one friend's brother had a noss and they had the police cameras.
0:19:10.960000 - 0:19:13.360000::And I'm like, I know you guys do meth.
0:19:13.360000 - 0:19:16.280000::I know that you shouldn't be driving this fast.
0:19:16.280000 - 0:19:22.280000::I want to get floor lights so fucking bad.
0:19:22.280000 - 0:19:23.880000::You don't even have a car, Jack.
0:19:23.880000 - 0:19:25.520000::I was just, I just thought of that.
0:19:25.520000 - 0:19:27.360000::You don't even have a car.
0:19:27.360000 - 0:19:28.880000::Why would I have one, man?
0:19:28.880000 - 0:19:30.120000::I'm serious.
0:19:30.120000 - 0:19:31.120000::You couldn't fucking.
0:19:31.120000 - 0:19:35.440000::You could not pay me to own a car where I currently live in New York City.
0:19:35.440000 - 0:19:39.200000::Because it takes so much fucking time and energy to find a parking spot.
0:19:39.200000 - 0:19:41.560000::What if I paid you a billion dollars?
0:19:41.560000 - 0:19:43.560000::A billion?
0:19:43.560000 - 0:19:44.560000::Well, dude.
0:19:44.560000 - 0:19:45.560000::Yeah.
0:19:45.560000 - 0:19:46.560000::I'm not that tough.
0:19:46.560000 - 0:19:52.760000::But otherwise, otherwise, yeah, I guess you could pay me.
0:19:52.760000 - 0:19:58.520000::But it would have to be at least 500 a week.
0:19:58.520000 - 0:20:00.040000::Because you don't want to have to move that.

0:20:00 - 0:20:02::I hate moving it.
0:20:02.600000 - 0:20:08.120000::Let me tell you about a certain app called Turo where you could get paid to have a car
0:20:08.600000 - 0:20:09.720000::man
0:20:09.720000 - 0:20:13.160000::If you had the if you had the nice enough car you could probably get 500
0:20:13.160000 - 0:20:16.120000::But I don't want to put my car on Turo. You know what I mean Nate
0:20:16.800000 - 0:20:21.480000::Why what do you think people are doing in them when they rent well because I used to do what's it called?
0:20:23 - 0:20:25::Zip car
0:20:25.500000 - 0:20:30.720000::And we would just rent them and you pay it for you for today and those things smelled like shit
0:20:30.880000 - 0:20:34.480000::You get in everyone sticky top to bottom cigarettes
0:20:35.200000 - 0:20:39.120000::But you don't know about Turo Turo is different Turo's got the smell test
0:20:39.360000 - 0:20:43::Turo we hit that jeep they get to smell you while they hand you the keys
0:20:43.600000 - 0:20:48.600000::Yeah, that's true if you smell smell that's what I messes them how it's smell on there
0:20:48.600000 - 0:20:52.240000::How to smell you know tea right? You know sweet tea right?
0:20:52.240000 - 0:20:58.320000::Mmm nobody smells like tea these days. I do when I keep them bags in my pocket
0:21:00.920000 - 0:21:04.960000::Lemon bags. So what was your first car?
0:21:05.440000 - 0:21:11.360000::My first car well frankly, I never had my own first car. That's what's very interesting about me
0:21:11.360000 - 0:21:18.580000::I drove my parents cars, but they didn't lose their use them that we for some reason at one point had three cars
0:21:19.100000 - 0:21:27.240000::Yeah rich, that's healthy. That's how we had a Ford Explorer. Okay, about a 2006
0:21:27.940000 - 0:21:32.840000::Ford Explorer the fatty we had a white Toyota Camry
0:21:33.620000 - 0:21:35.620000::2009 and we had a 2009
0:21:36.220000 - 0:21:41.940000::Volkswagen rabbit and that was my favorite to drive bar none until I drove a light pole
0:21:43.020000 - 0:21:46.740000::You drove into a light pole you guys know the story. Oh, that's a crazy looking car
0:21:46.740000 - 0:21:48.740000::I thought I was drunk driving because I had taken a shot
0:21:49.740000 - 0:21:56.220000::I had taken a shot when I was like 19 or 20 literally one shot earlier like three four hours before at a party
0:21:56.860000 - 0:21:59.940000::Drink water the rest of the night, but I was like I must be drunk
0:21:59.940000 - 0:22:05.540000::I should not be doing this. I'm drunk driving right now and I'm busting at home because I'm already past curvy and
0:22:06.060000 - 0:22:10.820000::I see all these people on the side of the freeway waving their hands like something's going on. I'm like
0:22:11.820000 - 0:22:18.100000::Would stop, but I'm drunk. You know, I'm like I can't do this and all of a sudden I see them go like this and I
0:22:18.620000 - 0:22:26.020000::Drive right over a downed light pole that had fallen onto the freeway. I drove over at 60 miles an hour. Oh my god
0:22:26.900000 - 0:22:31.500000::Did you not spin out or nothing? No, I didn't that's how much control I have as a driver
0:22:32.020000 - 0:22:36.060000::Today most people be yeah, it's been out you'd be one of those cars at some point me
0:22:36.660000 - 0:22:44.580000::Nope, but I was too afraid to pull over because I was like if a cop gets me I'm spending my life in prison and so
0:22:45.620000 - 0:22:50.380000::All the lights turn on I can hear the flapping. I don't know if the tires fully popped
0:22:50.380000 - 0:22:54.620000::But like the axle was fucked up the car felt like really bad to drive
0:22:54.620000 - 0:22:59.460000::You could feel like something was really wrong and then I made it home and I had to tell my mom
0:22:59.460000 - 0:23:04.020000::And she had a retainer in her mouth and was so fucking you know when your mom has your retainer in her mouth
0:23:04.420000 - 0:23:08.820000::And she's yelling at you. It's a different type of yelling. My mom doesn't have a retainer
0:23:08.820000 - 0:23:13.480000::But I could understand she should get one don't say that you drop that type of language stop
0:23:15.220000 - 0:23:20.740000::Jack what was your first vehicle did you have one have you ever had a car? Have you ever driven of course I have of course I have
0:23:21.820000 - 0:23:25.460000::No, I haven't I've never had a vehicle. I'm a city slicker
0:23:25.460000 - 0:23:31.580000::I'm a city never had a car God gave me two legs to walk on why would I do that? You know what Jack you kind of
0:23:32.220000 - 0:23:38.260000::On the vineyard that car that they keep up there that is one of my favorite cars on the planet blue the beach
0:23:38.860000 - 0:23:44.620000::Both of well the blue ones smells different but the the black the Ford
0:23:45.500000 - 0:23:48.060000::Whatever and I sand on it. It's like a beach
0:23:48.060000 - 0:23:54.020000::I'll be doing it. It's awesome. That's sick to me. Yeah. I love a good sandy old crusty
0:23:54.500000 - 0:23:59.420000::Crusted out never take the sand out car damn. I'd love to go back there someday
0:24:00.020000 - 0:24:07.940000::But my car driving around growing up. Let's see my mom had the white Dodge caravan or something ram something
0:24:08.700000 - 0:24:10.700000::It was amazing
0:24:11.060000 - 0:24:19.380000::It was always messy. I was not the most responsible driver I'd say I kind of got a bit of a kick out of
0:24:22.260000 - 0:24:28.500000::Being reckless how fat are you going if there's a speed bump probably 40 45
0:24:29.780000 - 0:24:34.340000::Damn, I would drive over curbs a lot to
0:24:35.860000 - 0:24:42.380000::Yeah, I was a bit of a reckless driver which fortunately never resulted in the harm of me or my friends
0:24:42.580000 - 0:24:44.580000::But God knows how that could end it up
0:24:46.020000 - 0:24:52.940000::And then my dad had a nasty ass Impala you already know the maroon Impala with the tan leather seats
0:24:52.980000 - 0:24:58.620000::You know what those seats smell like with the Pepsi off sticked on to it in the summer. Yeah
0:24:59.420000 - 0:25:01.700000::You

0:25:00 - 0:25:02.880000::And then flash forward to my diabetic aunt.
0:25:03.880000 - 0:25:07.920000::Moving on from driving and blessing us with a beautiful Ford
0:25:07.920000 - 0:25:11.040000::focus, which unlocked is from driving.
0:25:11.960000 - 0:25:15.960000::Well, and the back bumper is is off of the car, you know, so it makes it
0:25:15.960000 - 0:25:17.080000::look like a rally car.
0:25:18.360000 - 0:25:19.240000::What are you talking about?
0:25:20.240000 - 0:25:22.080000::That blue Ford focus at y'all.
0:25:22.080000 - 0:25:26.280000::So I hope that the back bumper show, so it looks like it's a legit rally
0:25:26.280000 - 0:25:26.880000::vehicle.
0:25:27.480000 - 0:25:27.960000::It's cool.
0:25:28.160000 - 0:25:30.440000::And it is the way we drive that thing around.
0:25:32.080000 - 0:25:35.240000::Do you think people in the UK that are listening to this are like, what
0:25:35.240000 - 0:25:37.560000::the number of single one of these brands?
0:25:38.840000 - 0:25:40.400000::Probably they have a car.
0:25:40.400000 - 0:25:41.400000::Do you think they're driving?
0:25:41.400000 - 0:25:42.240000::They're driving.
0:25:42.240000 - 0:25:43.120000::Here's a couple more.
0:25:43.120000 - 0:25:45.680000::The Reynolds Reynolds.
0:25:46.320000 - 0:25:46.960000::You know, that one.
0:25:47.520000 - 0:25:52.520000::Don't tell me the people in the UK are driving like all types of weird vehicles.
0:25:52.720000 - 0:25:54.120000::They are, man.
0:25:54.120000 - 0:25:54.720000::You need to.

0:26:01.040000 - 0:26:04.440000::You do so you don't sound like a tool, man, when we talk about international cars.
0:26:05.400000 - 0:26:06.680000::She's gone to school.
0:26:09.880000 - 0:26:11.520000::I've never recalled doing that before.
0:26:11.520000 - 0:26:16.600000::But I felt like just you just brought out that word out of the fucking gravy.
0:26:16.800000 - 0:26:17.600000::Tool.

0:27:10.160000 - 0:27:16.320000::The car I have right now, Mazda 3 hatchback 2018 does the job.
0:27:17.760000 - 0:27:19.920000::Turbo mode has a sport mode.
0:27:20.400000 - 0:27:23.520000::And did you have your heart set on that when you were shopping around for
0:27:23.520000 - 0:27:27.320000::vehicles or did somebody influence you and brainwash you into your purchase?
0:27:27.880000 - 0:27:29.240000::Because that's not an American vehicle.
0:27:29.240000 - 0:27:30::That's what I noticed.
0:27:30 - 0:27:30.640000::It's not American.
0:27:30.640000 - 0:27:31.720000::It's Japanese.
0:27:31.920000 - 0:27:32.680000::It's Japanese.
0:27:33.160000 - 0:27:33.440000::Right.
0:27:33.600000 - 0:27:35.520000::Well, I'll tell you what I was.
0:27:35.520000 - 0:27:38.960000::I wanted a Volkswagen GTI, you know, those ones.
0:27:39.640000 - 0:27:41.680000::But I feel like I've aged out of it.
0:27:41.960000 - 0:27:45::It's like you should be a little younger if you have that car.
0:27:45.760000 - 0:27:47.400000::I kind of like hot hatches.
0:27:47.400000 - 0:27:51.840000::You guys know these are like sick hatchbacks, fast little hatchbacks.
0:27:52.440000 - 0:27:54::People like which you go into.
0:27:54.520000 - 0:27:57.680000::We should go into what your car says about you different brands.
0:27:57.680000 - 0:27:58.600000::Oh, dream car.
0:27:58.600000 - 0:28:01.440000::Yeah, because yeah, and dream cars as well.

0:28:13.320000 - 0:28:14.480000::What did you say?
0:28:14.480000 - 0:28:16.160000::Black Toyota Prius.
0:28:16.160000 - 0:28:16.520000::Not.
0:28:18.760000 - 0:28:20.520000::I think it just says like.
0:28:21.440000 - 0:28:25.360000::You're just so you're just so regular Eric.

0:28:30.400000 - 0:28:34.040000::It's I thought you said I thought you were saying what does it say about you?
0:28:34.040000 - 0:28:37.200000::If you're driving a silver Toyota Prius, I thought you said black.
0:28:37.800000 - 0:28:38.600000::That you black.
0:28:42.840000 - 0:28:43.800000::Just for it.
0:28:43.800000 - 0:28:45.320000::It's pretty specific I guess.
0:28:47.320000 - 0:28:48.320000::That'd be a hard car.
0:28:48.320000 - 0:28:49.520000::White person's car.
0:28:49.680000 - 0:28:50.200000::Yeah.

0:28:53.280000 - 0:28:54.520000::Awesome discussion.
0:28:55.320000 - 0:28:56.440000::Oh, it's a black one.
0:28:56.440000 - 0:28:57.280000::I didn't realize it.
0:28:57.280000 - 0:28:58.040000::Yeah, it's a black one.

0:29:00.280000 - 0:29:01.360000::You've been in this car.
0:29:01.360000 - 0:29:03.560000::I believe someone will investigate part two of this.
0:29:03.560000 - 0:29:04.080000::That was it.
0:29:05.400000 - 0:29:05.920000::Yes.
0:29:06.440000 - 0:29:07.880000::But I think it's a very basic.
0:29:07.880000 - 0:29:14.160000::It just says like, I guess you kind of I guess you care about the fucking environment.
0:29:14.160000 - 0:29:16.160000::I mean, does it have any good up and go?
0:29:16.520000 - 0:29:19.800000::You're getting away from the matrix twins with the white dreads and

0:29:23.920000 - 0:29:24.920000::a barrel.
0:29:24.920000 - 0:29:27.720000::Can you get off the freeway in time and that thing?
0:29:28 - 0:29:29.480000::Well, let me tell you something.
0:29:29.520000 - 0:29:35.280000::Usually I'm driving in eco mode on one of these, which it takes a little bit more
0:29:35.320000 - 0:29:39.240000::pressure on the gas to get this bitch going.
0:29:39.240000 - 0:29:40.240000::Yeah.
0:29:40.240000 - 0:29:43.720000::But there's this other button called power drive.
0:29:43.880000 - 0:29:44.880000::Oh, shit.
0:29:44.880000 - 0:29:49.760000::So when the matrix, the dreadlock twins are coming after me because white people
0:29:49.760000 - 0:29:51.320000::will wipe Joe's twins.

0:30:30.640000 - 0:30:31.800000::Essential question.
0:30:33.480000 - 0:30:35.720000::A better question is where do you not keep them?
0:30:35.800000 - 0:30:40.760000::Where where where can people sit that they won't accidentally sit on a gun, weed or liquor?
0:30:43.320000 - 0:30:44.040000::That's a good.
0:30:44.040000 - 0:30:47.040000::You're going to want to sit outside my fucking car if you want to sit that way.

0:31:10.920000 - 0:31:14.400000::They open a bottle of wine in the car and I think, isn't that now?
0:31:14.400000 - 0:31:17.120000::Isn't that dangerous messaging to be sending the kids?
0:31:17.880000 - 0:31:18.840000::Well, is it for kids?

0:33:01.800000 - 0:33:02.440000::Sounds good.
0:33:02.960000 - 0:33:06.480000::Then go to the Mazda three subreddit and tell me what you want to talk about.
0:33:09.520000 - 0:33:10.680000::I am subscribed to that.
0:33:12.200000 - 0:33:13.560000::The Mazda three.
0:33:16.760000 - 0:33:19::The one place and you can find me.
0:33:20 - 0:33:23.360000::And by the way, yeah, maybe that's true for the regular trims,
0:33:23.680000 - 0:33:29.160000::but whoops, I have the grand touring trim leather heated seats,
0:33:29.560000 - 0:33:33.160000::Bose sound system, that sounds all crackly when it gets cold outside.
0:33:33.680000 - 0:33:34.200000::Okay.
0:33:34.600000 - 0:33:38.160000::Well, can we, we need to pivot into this topic, which is,
0:33:38.640000 - 0:33:41.200000::because I can feel this is getting a little heated right now.
0:33:41.200000 - 0:33:44::It's getting, it's like disturbing me because I don't want to find it.
0:33:44 - 0:33:45.520000::And I don't want this.
0:33:45.520000 - 0:33:47.800000::So I'm going to pivot to a different discussion.
0:33:47.800000 - 0:33:48.680000::Is that okay?
0:33:49.640000 - 0:33:50.160000::Yeah.
0:33:50.160000 - 0:33:50.640000::Yeah.
0:33:51.640000 - 0:33:54.280000::So I think we should talk about driving style.
0:33:55.040000 - 0:33:56.040000::What's everything?
0:33:56.040000 - 0:33:57.040000::All right.
0:33:57.040000 - 0:34:01.800000::Well, Nate, because I don't want to heat this up anymore, but you drive granny style,
0:34:01.800000 - 0:34:02.800000::bitch.
0:34:05.920000 - 0:34:10.760000::Wait, you, I thought you drive it about 10 and you drive like 11 and one.
0:34:10.760000 - 0:34:12.040000::You know how you supposed to do 10 and two.
0:34:12.280000 - 0:34:17.240000::You're 10 and one white knuckleing it through a 25 through a school zone.
0:34:17.640000 - 0:34:21.720000::Eric, when you fucking, when you inevitably die in a car crash,
0:34:21.760000 - 0:34:26.960000::I'm not going to be reposing about how much Eric meant to me, how much I loved him.
0:34:26.960000 - 0:34:30.800000::I'm going to be replaying this moment to say if he only would,
0:34:31.040000 - 0:34:33.280000::oh, he's making fun of people who drive safe.
0:34:33.560000 - 0:34:34.760000::Look where that got him.
0:34:34.760000 - 0:34:35.560000::He's dead.
0:34:37.560000 - 0:34:40.040000::Eric, and we've almost gotten a lot of car crashes together.
0:34:40.680000 - 0:34:42.960000::And I don't want to say that liquor was involved because it wasn't.
0:34:43.480000 - 0:34:45.080000::How many of them are at my whole?
0:34:45.200000 - 0:34:46.800000::It was never a reckless.
0:34:46.800000 - 0:34:49.120000::It was never a reckless city planning.
0:34:49.120000 - 0:34:49.640000::You don't.
0:34:50.920000 - 0:34:56.200000::I've been in your car many times and you are fucking a reckless to the point where
0:34:56.840000 - 0:34:59.880000::I don't think you really care about your own life.

0:35:00 - 0:35:05.840000::the life of your friends. And because the way that you were on your phone and the life
0:35:05.840000 - 0:35:10.080000::of others around you, because the way that you are on your phone, it would seem like
0:35:10.080000 - 0:35:15.920000::you weren't even on the road driving. I listen to your phone like you're like you're just
0:35:15.920000 - 0:35:22.480000::scrolling through the news on on this. If this were two years ago, yeah, I would listen
0:35:22.480000 - 0:35:28.600000::to this and I might take it in and think about it. But I've already paid my dues. I already
0:35:28.600000 - 0:35:34::got pulled over for texting and driving. So if you say I haven't faced justice for
0:35:34 - 0:35:39.080000::what I've done, then you might be barking up the wrong tree. Okay. I don't look at my
0:35:39.080000 - 0:35:46.480000::phone anymore. It wasn't really texting and driving area. It was Instagram. And they saw
0:35:46.480000 - 0:35:51.440000::it was Instagram. You couldn't say like, Oh, I was looking for the name of the restaurant
0:35:51.440000 - 0:35:54::that I was going to because I need like, you know what I'm saying? Because you could
0:35:54 - 0:35:59.280000::use your GPS. Couldn't you lie down on that one? I probably could because it was at a
0:35:59.280000 - 0:36:09.040000::stoplight. And I think I was I'm not going 65. You know what I'm saying? But they say actually
0:36:09.040000 - 0:36:15.400000::some of the most deadly accidents happen at low speeds. So be careful out there. Really?
0:36:15.400000 - 0:36:19.280000::I get that because think about an elephant stepping on you. They don't have to go fast.
0:36:19.280000 - 0:36:26.800000::I will say what did you say? They don't have to go fast to crush your nuts. They just
0:36:26.800000 - 0:36:33.920000::step on you all slow. Just like our slow car. He's appreciating. Yeah. Yeah. Can I say that
0:36:33.920000 - 0:36:42.720000::Jack's driving style? He almost turns driving into a form of a Riz on the road road. Yeah,
0:36:42.720000 - 0:36:48.760000::you know, I don't even touch the wheel as little as I can. I like to go like this is
0:36:48.760000 - 0:36:55.840000::the wheel. I like to go like this just on the bottom. Oh, I don't I hardly usually I'm not
0:36:55.840000 - 0:37:01.080000::even touching it. I got a foot barefoot out the window no matter the weather. And I got my hand
0:37:01.080000 - 0:37:06.240000::just touching my doctor. He's trying to get some somebody to call the cough going. Yeah,
0:37:06.240000 - 0:37:11.920000::that's right. Touch the ball. You doctor touch that touching. They don't touch the balls. They
0:37:11.920000 - 0:37:16.360000::don't. They won't. And you know what, Jack? I want to just give another shout out to that awesome
0:37:16.360000 - 0:37:26.440000::Ford. Yeah. That car has what we call serious XM radio built. And you would think when, oh, I have
0:37:26.440000 - 0:37:31.800000::Spotify. I don't need serious XM. That's all that's for boomers. That's for Gen X who want to
0:37:31.800000 - 0:37:38.040000::listen to their replacements radio, whatever. Think again, because it's so fun to turn on the
0:37:38.040000 - 0:37:43.400000::water color station. Listen to this. Mojez. Turn on the 70 station. Have someone curate a playlist
0:37:43.400000 - 0:37:50.920000::for you live? Okay. So if anybody wants to come for serious XM, you're going to have to come
0:37:50.920000 - 0:38:00.600000::through my ass. My serious ass. My most serious ass. What's everybody's favorite moment in a car
0:38:00.600000 - 0:38:13.320000::that they can think of? Well, mine, my bill. No, no, non-sexual, non-sexual. Okay. All right. Let's
0:38:13.320000 - 0:38:19.720000::keep it PG. Favorite, well, what's the sex episode? What do the public sex episode next time? Yeah.
0:38:21.560000 - 0:38:29.320000::Favorite moment in a car? Or least favorite moment. Yo, you know about road trips, right? You know
0:38:29.320000 - 0:38:36.440000::about car sickness, right? Ooh, when someone's got a puke in the bag. Ooh, when somebody wants to pee.
0:38:37.240000 - 0:38:43::Now Nate, you hate games and you hate having fun because you have some twisted obsession with,
0:38:43 - 0:38:48.600000::I don't know what, hustling pain and you need to pay for something you don't that you want to tell
0:38:48.600000 - 0:38:58.200000::us about. Well, you don't like road trip games? No. The three of us are in a car. What's the problem?
0:38:59.320000 - 0:39:06.600000::The car for three weeks. Three hours. Three, three week road trip. No bathroom breaks.
0:39:07.880000 - 0:39:14.760000::Yeah. Mr. B's style challenge style. They built a road across the ocean. What are you okay with? Are you
0:39:14.760000 - 0:39:22.360000::okay with free styling? Of course. Free styling can happen anywhere. Yeah. All right. All right.
0:39:23.640000 - 0:39:28.520000::Are you okay with funny business in the car? No, I'm not. Like tickling each other?
0:39:29.080000 - 0:39:34.040000::What does that mean? Every time I'm in a car and there's people in the back, I say no funny business
0:39:34.040000 - 0:39:39.240000::back there. Just getting ready to have some kids in the back saying that to the teens. No funny
0:39:39.240000 - 0:39:47.720000::business. Here's what I want as a driver in my car when we're on a road trip. Okay? I want respect
0:39:48.760000 - 0:39:54.760000::as the driver and so nobody seems to be giving me respect every life. Can I at least get respect while
0:39:54.760000 - 0:39:57.400000::driving

0:40:00 - 0:40:02::I'll give you that.
0:40:02 - 0:40:06.400000::Remember when we were driving in Costa Rica internationally?
0:40:06.400000 - 0:40:07.760000::Yeah, yep.
0:40:07.760000 - 0:40:09.840000::And remember, we talked up into your roads.
0:40:09.840000 - 0:40:12.360000::Yeah, that came up.
0:40:12.360000 - 0:40:15.920000::Yeah, oh god.
0:40:15.920000 - 0:40:18.120000::The roads there were, man, you really
0:40:18.120000 - 0:40:21.640000::did need a damn four-wheel drive.
0:40:21.640000 - 0:40:22.680000::Yeah, you did.
0:40:22.680000 - 0:40:24.880000::In the places that we would go to,
0:40:24.880000 - 0:40:28.120000::because we were in the main cities.
0:40:28.120000 - 0:40:29.960000::We're definitely not in the main cities anywhere.
0:40:29.960000 - 0:40:33::We go unless we're there for an award ceremony.
0:40:33 - 0:40:34.280000::That's what we'll show up.
0:40:34.280000 - 0:40:37.720000::We're going to the local, the small towns.
0:40:37.720000 - 0:40:40.200000::The small towns.
0:40:40.200000 - 0:40:42.040000::All right, let's see what gave us joy.
0:40:42.040000 - 0:40:43.040000::Joy.
0:40:43.040000 - 0:40:48.600000::Was that a smooth segue?
0:40:48.600000 - 0:40:50.240000::That was a good one.
0:40:50.240000 - 0:40:52::Yeah, it was extremely smooth.
0:40:52 - 0:40:53.560000::Well, little people in the curtain,
0:40:53.560000 - 0:40:55.960000::this is the emergency episode.
0:40:55.960000 - 0:40:59.640000::And if it seems like Jack, you didn't really kind of go in.
0:40:59.640000 - 0:41:02.160000::You didn't really barbecue anybody this episode.
0:41:02.160000 - 0:41:05.440000::You didn't really give your political take on what's going on.
0:41:05.440000 - 0:41:07.640000::Literally, Vivek Ramaswamy just dropped out of the race
0:41:07.640000 - 0:41:09.600000::and is going to end George Trump, even though he literally,
0:41:09.600000 - 0:41:11.560000::that's where we're at right now in the world.
0:41:11.560000 - 0:41:14.360000::It's probably very different from when this actually comes out.
0:41:14.360000 - 0:41:18.480000::Well, it's because we just recorded an episode 40 minutes ago.
0:41:18.480000 - 0:41:19.080000::But guess what?
0:41:21.840000 - 0:41:22.520000::Yeah, I don't know.
0:41:22.520000 - 0:41:26.200000::Do you guys want to keep talking about cars?
0:41:26.200000 - 0:41:28.880000::Or should we say what gave us joy?
0:41:28.880000 - 0:41:31.120000::This is an emergency episode.
0:41:33.120000 - 0:41:34.840000::Let's go into it.
0:41:34.840000 - 0:41:36.400000::Let's wrap it up.
0:41:36.400000 - 0:41:38.520000::OK, let's wrap it up with the cars first.
0:41:38.520000 - 0:41:39.520000::Let's wrap it up.
0:41:39.520000 - 0:41:41.440000::Because the last thing we forgot to do
0:41:41.440000 - 0:41:43.440000::is say what's our dream car?
0:41:43.440000 - 0:41:44.440000::OK.
0:41:44.440000 - 0:41:45.600000::Humber H2.
0:41:45.600000 - 0:41:47.720000::And that's what I don't want to miss out on.
0:41:47.720000 - 0:41:54.360000::Humber H2, yellow, ludicrous wrapping all over the size of it.
0:41:54.360000 - 0:41:55.840000::Is it banana yellow?
0:41:55.840000 - 0:42:00.160000::It's banana style, lafytaffy banana style yellow.
0:42:00.160000 - 0:42:02.800000::It's got the fucking grill in the back
0:42:02.800000 - 0:42:05.480000::where you could flip burgers docky way in the trunk.
0:42:05.480000 - 0:42:07.160000::It's got the freaking penis on it.
0:42:07.160000 - 0:42:09.560000::Is it how the Xbox is in the back of the...
0:42:09.560000 - 0:42:11.080000::This is like a Pimp My Ride.
0:42:11.080000 - 0:42:14.680000::This is a Pimp My Ride style.
0:42:14.680000 - 0:42:15.680000::That's the dream.
0:42:15.680000 - 0:42:16.560000::A Humber H2.
0:42:16.560000 - 0:42:19.360000::Every time I see a Humber H2 parked on the side of the road
0:42:19.360000 - 0:42:22.440000::in New York City, I literally want to stand there and wait
0:42:22.440000 - 0:42:25.280000::and camp out for that person to return so I could ask,
0:42:25.280000 - 0:42:27.920000::how the fuck did you get that thing?
0:42:27.920000 - 0:42:31::If you win the voice like you've been wanting to Jack this year,
0:42:31 - 0:42:38.480000::and you use the money to get electric a electric Humber,
0:42:38.480000 - 0:42:40.440000::that's going to be a failure.
0:42:40.440000 - 0:42:44.880000::I don't think that that thing can hold a candle to the H2, man.
0:42:44.880000 - 0:42:46.680000::It's the H2 or nothing.
0:42:46.680000 - 0:42:47.160000::That's it.
0:42:47.160000 - 0:42:49.400000::You wouldn't take a electric Humber.
0:42:49.400000 - 0:42:52.240000::I don't care if I got to go down into the dirt myself,
0:42:52.240000 - 0:42:56.240000::gover style with my teeth and dig that fucking oil up out of the ground
0:42:56.240000 - 0:42:58.240000::and put it in a fucking hammer.
0:42:58.240000 - 0:42:59.240000::I ain't done.
0:42:59.240000 - 0:43:03.200000::If it's my dream car, it's American muscle, it's all,
0:43:03.200000 - 0:43:06.320000::and it's yellow, and it's a Humber H2.
0:43:06.320000 - 0:43:07.680000::That's the car for me.
0:43:07.680000 - 0:43:13::H2, that one would smell, you know how they're about cars normal bad?
0:43:13 - 0:43:15.640000::Your car would smell good as fuck like candy.
0:43:15.640000 - 0:43:17.760000::Oh, my car would sting in nostrils when you get in it
0:43:17.760000 - 0:43:20.160000::because it's so mean to me.
0:43:20.160000 - 0:43:22.880000::Like getting into a fucking steam room with the eucalyptus in it.
0:43:22.880000 - 0:43:24.720000::Eucalyptus in it.
0:43:24.720000 - 0:43:28.880000::My car, getting in my car is like walking into like a halls,
0:43:28.880000 - 0:43:29.560000::you know what I'm saying?
0:43:29.560000 - 0:43:30.920000::Extreme strength halls.
0:43:30.920000 - 0:43:33.160000::Mm-hmm.
0:43:33.160000 - 0:43:34.800000::And I always keep friends in the back seat,
0:43:34.800000 - 0:43:37::no matter what time of day.
0:43:37 - 0:43:39.400000::Nice, they're stoked by there.
0:43:39.400000 - 0:43:41.400000::No, I don't like that.
0:43:41.400000 - 0:43:43.080000::Well, Eric, what's your dream car?
0:43:43.080000 - 0:43:43.920000::What's your dream car?
0:43:43.920000 - 0:43:45.760000::Don't play.
0:43:45.760000 - 0:43:47.200000::I'll say, you know what?
0:43:47.200000 - 0:43:50.560000::I'm not going to play, and I would never.
0:43:50.560000 - 0:43:52.360000::My dream car, I'm a little bit, you know,
0:43:52.360000 - 0:43:59.960000::I'm kind of in a transitionary period with my car taste where I hate to say it.
0:43:59.960000 - 0:44:07.240000::I hate to say it, but I'm liking these sort of classic cars.
0:44:07.240000 - 0:44:09.360000::J Leno style.
0:44:09.360000 - 0:44:13.920000::I see a classic car, a two-seater that's low to the ground
0:44:13.920000 - 0:44:20.080000::that I could barely fit in from the 60s Italian car, you know,
0:44:20.080000 - 0:44:23.840000::some Italian made two-seater, something about that.
0:44:23.840000 - 0:44:25.560000::You want a little one like that?
0:44:25.560000 - 0:44:27.760000::I want a little one, a tiny one.
0:44:27.760000 - 0:44:30.120000::One that would just get decimated in an accent.
0:44:30.120000 - 0:44:32.560000::Like if I got any wreck, it's over.
0:44:32.560000 - 0:44:34.680000::That car's exploding, I'm dead.
0:44:34.680000 - 0:44:38.600000::The person in definitely in the driver's seat is fucking dead,
0:44:38.600000 - 0:44:40.080000::and it's over, you know?
0:44:40.080000 - 0:44:42.320000::That's the type of car that I want to be in.
0:44:42.320000 - 0:44:45.400000::You want to be in this immersive, old style.
0:44:45.400000 - 0:44:46.560000::And I don't care how it smells.
0:44:46.560000 - 0:44:48.280000::You guys are always talking about the smell of the car.
0:44:48.280000 - 0:44:51.680000::I don't give a fuck as long as it's low, as long as it's tiny.
0:44:51.680000 - 0:44:53.600000::You want a low, right?
0:44:53.600000 - 0:44:55.600000::I want the low.
0:44:55.600000 - 0:44:57.800000::I want it to be sparks flying.
0:44:57.800000 - 0:44:59.960000::If you want to be face up.

0:45:00 - 0:45:04.800000::You want to have a mirror on the ceiling that lets you see forwards because you're lying flat on your back
0:45:05.840000 - 0:45:13.500000::The lowest car so you want a low-riding Cadillac and you want that painted candy candy style candy
0:45:16.800000 - 0:45:18.800000::Be careful now, man
0:45:20.400000 - 0:45:22.400000::Your dream card yourself happens to be
0:45:30.560000 - 0:45:36.160000::You bring out your new like fucking low as hell khaki shorts. You just have a tall white socks
0:45:40.320000 - 0:45:45.120000::Yep, okay, Eric what the fuck is your ass because you are in your dream car right now
0:45:45.120000 - 0:45:51.280000::So this is gonna be fun. You know what I'm not really. I mean, it's a great to find car. It does the trick, but I
0:45:52.200000 - 0:45:57.480000::Kind of I'll tell you what have you guys seen these like have you guys seen people take Lexus is from the 90s?
0:45:58.480000 - 0:46:01.080000::Or at least 2000 and turn them out into kind of offer
0:46:02.200000 - 0:46:04.200000::What is that Nate?
0:46:05.800000 - 0:46:13.760000::Another CBD cigarette CBD cigarette round two lie it now light that shit now Scooby-Doo buddy smokes
0:46:14.600000 - 0:46:19.200000::Look at this one. This is a 1999 Lexus LX 470
0:46:20.360000 - 0:46:25.700000::Look how sick that looks what the hell looks almost like a Jeep or almost a
0:46:25.700000 - 0:46:28.340000::Lexus SUV
0:46:29.300000 - 0:46:31.460000::Can I say something with off-road capabilities?
0:46:31.460000 - 0:46:39.100000::Can I say something about the Lexus real quick because you think that what do you think that Alexis is on par with a Mercedes-Benz?
0:46:41.540000 - 0:46:43.540000::You think they're
0:46:43.940000 - 0:46:45.940000::Do you know Lexus is a luxury car?
0:46:46.740000 - 0:46:51.640000::Lexus is you know Lexus is the luxury version of Toyota. They're owned by this in company
0:46:51.640000 - 0:46:59.280000::My exactly and I found this out recently and I thought I thought that like Lexus was like in Audi it was like a
0:47:00.200000 - 0:47:04.680000::All the same level is like a BMW. It's not it's more like I
0:47:05.600000 - 0:47:08.240000::Don't know what it's compared to but it's definitely that they're
0:47:13.520000 - 0:47:20.360000::Talking about the history of Lexus with like a CBD cigarette burning like the whole cigarette is burning like aren't you like the whole thing?
0:47:21.640000 - 0:47:26.820000::You are getting ready for the road experience
0:47:27.320000 - 0:47:31::Like this is the this is a practice. Baby. You're right, man
0:47:32.600000 - 0:47:37.680000::But wait you're disappointed that Lexus is actually like I was lied to by the branding
0:47:37.680000 - 0:47:43.160000::I feel like that I want to say shout out to the Toyota branding and marketing team because they've convinced me that Lexus is
0:47:43.480000 - 0:47:45.480000::nicer than it actually is
0:47:45.800000 - 0:47:49.920000::Yeah, but listen Lexus is to everybody
0:47:50.040000 - 0:47:55.240000::I mean people want to hear my takes on this shit. Alexis like a Toyota like a Honda
0:47:55.880000 - 0:47:59.640000::The what I recently read is that these cars are built like appliances
0:48:00.320000 - 0:48:04.480000::Okay, they are built to fucking last they might not be that crazy fun to drive
0:48:04.680000 - 0:48:08.280000::They might not have that much pickup or our horsepower whatever
0:48:08.600000 - 0:48:12.600000::But these cars are built to last and they have crazy resale value
0:48:13.080000 - 0:48:19.720000::So get get a grip if you're gonna come make fun of Lexus or Toyota cut very what color?
0:48:19.920000 - 0:48:21.920000::I
0:48:24.800000 - 0:48:26.800000::Can really see that
0:48:31.240000 - 0:48:33.240000::This one's gonna get a lot of cancellations
0:48:37.240000 - 0:48:42.320000::Yeah, maybe so that's the emergency up for you. We like it that way. That's the emergency up
0:48:42.720000 - 0:48:45.200000::Well, and so what gave us joy here? Oh
0:48:45.200000 - 0:48:52.360000::I hate to make it about food, but you know Jets pizzas so good we talked about it
0:48:52.360000 - 0:48:59.840000::Oh, but you know what they got that if you order Jets pizza you better be buying this what they sell ranch in a little
0:48:59.840000 - 0:49:01.840000::Squeeze bottle have you seen this? Oh
0:49:02.880000 - 0:49:11.080000::It's like in like a diner style like mustard or ketchup like yeah, but it's ranch and it's like so fun
0:49:11.280000 - 0:49:15.240000::No, no, so that's it. They have great ranch by the way
0:49:15.240000 - 0:49:18.520000::I do really yeah, and the fact doesn't
0:49:18.520000 - 0:49:25.880000::Yeah, it does so what what brought me joy was I got my cat a new toy and when you're when
0:49:26.400000 - 0:49:28.320000::these cats only have a couple of
0:49:28.840000 - 0:49:31.560000::toys in their life span, you know and
0:49:32.800000 - 0:49:37.720000::My cat is so jacked whenever she gets a new toy to play with and
0:49:38.200000 - 0:49:41.280000::It's just a little hook that you put on top of this
0:49:42.040000 - 0:49:44.040000::It's like a it's called
