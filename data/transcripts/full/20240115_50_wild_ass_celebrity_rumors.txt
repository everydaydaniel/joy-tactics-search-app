0:09:49.640000 - 0:09:50.400000::All right.
0:09:50.400000 - 0:09:51.240000::I'm just joking.
0:09:51.240000 - 0:09:52.560000::I stole that joke from my girlfriend.
0:09:52.560000 - 0:09:53.240000::God damn it.
0:09:53.240000 - 0:09:54.800000::Why did I even fucking do that?
0:09:54.800000 - 0:09:57.200000::Well, here's the celebrity rumor.
0:09:57.200000 - 0:10:00.040000::They're bringing Harry Potter to HB.

0:10:16.400000 - 0:10:20.680000::Because she's what you call turf. What do you say?
0:10:20.680000 - 0:10:25.480000::She's a turf. She's a turf. She's a University of Maryland football fan or whatever.
0:10:26.200000 - 0:10:28.200000::Now I'm just playing.
0:10:28.200000 - 0:10:32.520000::So she's a turf. Do you know what happens to turf when it dries out?
0:10:32.520000 - 0:10:35.320000::It gets all fire.
0:10:35.320000 - 0:10:38.160000::Because.
0:10:38.160000 - 0:10:41.360000::Okay, chill.
0:10:41.360000 - 0:10:44.920000::By the way, Jack is threatening to set JK Rowling on fire.
0:10:44.920000 - 0:10:48.080000::This is not a threat. We're not gonna walk this back. This isn't a threat.

0:10:57.960000 - 0:11:01.960000::Dripping in the air.
0:11:01.960000 - 0:11:03.400000::You dress as a scarecrow.
0:11:03.400000 - 0:11:07.240000::Your dress is like, you know, the most terrifying that you can imagine all kind of dress.
0:11:07.240000 - 0:11:14.240000::Dressed as a scarecrow going to that's what nobody's done within assassination is try to make it as scary as possible, right?
0:11:14.240000 - 0:11:19.320000::Like if fucking George, what's his name who killed John Lennon?
0:11:19.320000 - 0:11:20.840000::Jared let out the Jit guy.
0:11:20.840000 - 0:11:23.280000::Yeah, Jared let out.
0:11:23.280000 - 0:11:34::Mark David Jettman. Mark David Jettman had showed up like what you're saying as like a fucking bird with like human fucking bones sticking out of his neck and like.
0:11:34 - 0:11:36.160000::He's got the plague Dr. Mask on.
0:11:36.160000 - 0:11:38.720000::Yeah, he's got all long sticking out the top.
0:11:38.720000 - 0:11:41.080000::How did it get out there so far?
0:11:41.080000 - 0:11:42.080000::How long is that time?
0:11:42.080000 - 0:11:45.080000::Yeah, if you're gonna take somebody out, get a little scary with it.
0:11:45.080000 - 0:11:49.720000::Get a little creative because you only get one shot at this and you're gonna be dead or in jail.
0:11:49.720000 - 0:11:54.200000::I'm not making it crazy and fascinating in a way.
0:11:54.200000 - 0:11:55.200000::Yeah.
0:11:55.200000 - 0:11:56.680000::Dress up.
0:11:56.680000 - 0:12:02.640000::There's something so funny about I know I've maybe said this before but being so scared to.
0:12:02.640000 - 0:12:03.640000::Terrified.
0:12:03.640000 - 0:12:05.640000::That's really funny.
0:12:05.640000 - 0:12:08.200000::No, it's not funny.
0:12:08.200000 - 0:12:12.440000::Actually, it's horrible and that's a horrible thing that I don't want to advocate.
0:12:12.440000 - 0:12:18.040000::But there's something about you imagine going to be with your grandparents and they peacefully go and it's no problem in there.
0:12:18.040000 - 0:12:20.640000::You're ready to go and they squeeze your hand and it's over.
0:12:20.640000 - 0:12:25.040000::But to be screaming as you're in the hospital bed like you like it so you don't want to go.
0:12:25.040000 - 0:12:26.040000::No, no, no, no.
0:12:26.040000 - 0:12:27.360000::You try, you're like no things.
0:12:27.360000 - 0:12:28.360000::Kind of falling.
0:12:28.360000 - 0:12:34.200000::Yeah, I'm gonna give people jobs when I'm dying because they're gonna have to hire extra people to like hold me down.
0:12:34.200000 - 0:12:36.120000::You're gonna be ripping out the IVs.
0:12:36.120000 - 0:12:39.600000::I'm gonna be fueling whatever hospital industrial comp.
0:12:39.600000 - 0:12:46.600000::I'm gonna be a nurse is gonna get a check from specifically because I'm in there, you know, because they're gonna have to hire like.
0:12:46.600000 - 0:12:53.160000::Yeah, they're gonna get it to hold me down just because I'm gonna be shaking and fucking right.
0:12:53.160000 - 0:12:58.760000::I'm gonna be so afraid to go that I'm gonna be so interested in seeing you the purie.
0:12:58.760000 - 0:13:03.640000::So I'm gonna be crawling in my, on my boney, knees and elbows down to the.
0:13:03.640000 - 0:13:09.240000::And, and I see you the neonatal intensive care unit and just checking out that.
0:13:09.240000 - 0:13:12.440000::So much hope for them little babies.
0:13:12.440000 - 0:13:14.040000::And then look at me.
0:13:14.040000 - 0:13:15.960000::I'm near the end.
0:13:15.960000 - 0:13:20.120000::And I'm gonna be on stage.
0:13:20.120000 - 0:13:24.440000::12 people in the audience 71 years old never worked out.
0:13:24.440000 - 0:13:26.520000::Still trying to hit the open mics.
0:13:26.520000 - 0:13:32.760000::And I'm gonna tell a joke that's gonna make somebody so mad that they're gonna fucking come up on stage and try to kick me off.
0:13:32.760000 - 0:13:35.800000::And I'm gonna have fucking heart attack.
0:13:35.800000 - 0:13:39.240000::And that's how you want to go.
0:13:39.240000 - 0:13:40.840000::Oh, is that I want to go?
0:13:40.840000 - 0:13:43.960000::Oh, okay, so here I, this is how I want to go.
0:13:43.960000 - 0:13:45.880000::Oh, shit, I just got shot.
0:13:45.880000 - 0:13:50.040000::Well, somebody put a bandaid on this shit, Carmen Electric, Jessica Simpson.
0:13:50.040000 - 0:13:51.720000::Things like that.
0:13:51.720000 - 0:13:53.560000::It looks like I just got shot in the neck.
0:13:53.560000 - 0:13:57.080000::It looks like the only bandaid might be your mouth.
0:13:57.080000 - 0:14:01.160000::I can't remember the ass.
0:14:01.160000 - 0:14:02.120000::That's sick.
0:14:02.120000 - 0:14:04.840000::Oh, here's what I want to care about the ass.
0:14:04.840000 - 0:14:06.200000::Try, that makes sense.
0:14:06.200000 - 0:14:10.120000::Here's what I want to say about murderers, right?
0:14:10.120000 - 0:14:11.480000::Can I make a point about murderers?
0:14:11.480000 - 0:14:12.280000::Can I do it?
0:14:12.280000 - 0:14:13::Can I say something?
0:14:13 - 0:14:17.160000::Please, man, then we cannot talk about death for 40 episodes.
0:14:17.160000 - 0:14:17.960000::All right.
0:14:17.960000 - 0:14:18.920000::Okay.
0:14:18.920000 - 0:14:20.360000::Well, all right.
0:14:20.360000 - 0:14:25.480000::So, we're one, we're sitting here and we're wondering why has murderers never done it in
0:14:25.480000 - 0:14:27.240000::an interesting way, right?
0:14:27.240000 - 0:14:31::I mean, that guess it's been an interesting way, but not like as creative as we are.
0:14:31 - 0:14:33.240000::And here's why.
0:14:33.240000 - 0:14:37.560000::If you come to the conclusion that murders the right answer, you must not be very creative
0:14:37.560000 - 0:14:39.800000::at all.
0:14:39.800000 - 0:14:43.480000::If you come to the conclusion that you should kill and somebody's life and that's the only
0:14:43.480000 - 0:14:50.600000::solution to your problems, you must not be able to outline a ladybug on a piece of paper
0:14:50.600000 - 0:14:59.240000::because a toddler with the creativity of a chicken nugget could show a new other option
0:14:59.240000 - 0:14:59.960000::than to

0:15:00 - 0:15:04.160000::Bees suing something so selfish. You know what I'm
0:15:05.160000 - 0:15:10.580000::Inline in the firing squad saying the shit right before they just don't go a fucking shit you mid sit sentence
0:15:10.580000 - 0:15:12.580000::Oh, but then I eat all the fucking bullets
0:15:14.520000 - 0:15:22.780000::No, that's not possible, but do you know what I'm saying like yeah, or is suck of course a murder is the last thing that I should do yeah
0:15:23.720000 - 0:15:25.960000::So now oh, I want to say oh
0:15:26.360000 - 0:15:34.400000::Walla there goes you do it. You just want to plug this a bit of an awa everybody's losing their minds over these Stanley water bottles
0:15:34.400000 - 0:15:39.600000::Well guess what I have one and guess what I think it shit my fucking tooth and when I didn't notice
0:15:40.600000 - 0:15:46.840000::People what is up with what I don't get why a water bottle can become popular
0:15:46.840000 - 0:15:55.840000::You know a shape of a water bottle how the hell is water a water bottle like a shoe like it's not
0:15:55.960000 - 0:16:00.200000::Well, okay an Air Force one. It's a fucking water bottle dude
0:16:00.760000 - 0:16:08.840000::Why do some people this is their whole personality dude they don't have much if you're a whole personality is a fucking water bottle
0:16:10.040000 - 0:16:13.440000::like I was gonna say something really bad
0:16:15.440000 - 0:16:20.540000::You said you can guess what you said it that is so I don't know it was uncalled for like it just in the moment
0:16:20.540000 - 0:16:25.920000::I felt like saying something really bad, but I'm not gonna say it and that's and that's how much
0:16:26.200000 - 0:16:32.160000::Awareness I have right now a lot of people will run their fucking mouth and say something they don't want to say I'm
0:16:32.680000 - 0:16:39.160000::I'm like a live TV like you know on live TV when there's like a seven-second delay. I kind of had that when I speak right there
0:16:39.160000 - 0:16:42.280000::Seven seconds right see what I'm saying in edit
0:16:42.280000 - 0:16:46.920000::That don't say wow racist shit. I wish I had that when I said Matt Damon
0:16:46.920000 - 0:16:50.360000::He puts you at the beginning of the episode. Yeah, I wish we hadn't said that because
0:16:52.040000 - 0:16:54.360000::His lawyers are gonna be contacting us. Oh
0:16:54.760000 - 0:16:59.040000::He's really serious too. I don't know if you guys saw Oppenheimer
0:16:59.400000 - 0:17:03.340000::But yeah, we you don't want to mess with someone like that
0:17:04.160000 - 0:17:11.360000::Wait, you said let me just give a quick go and do watch it. I just want to give a quick break out of the water bottle history of it all, okay?
0:17:12.400000 - 0:17:15.880000::2000s. What are we rocking with we're rocking with GNC
0:17:16.560000 - 0:17:18.360000::shaker water
0:17:18.360000 - 0:17:26.520000::Protein shake bottles that have a little metal whisk ball on the bottom and that shit smells like way protein no matter how many times you wash it
0:17:26.520000 - 0:17:28.520000::Okay, remember those and we had the
0:17:28.520000 - 0:17:33.600000::That's extra BPA your BPA pure 100%
0:17:34 - 0:17:36::Dosed BPA
0:17:36 - 0:17:38::Darcia blind
0:17:40.280000 - 0:17:44.560000::Then we move into the 2010s what's hitting well in Colorado
0:17:44.560000 - 0:17:51.040000::This has been hitting for a while the Nal jeans you put the stickers on them you put your fleet foxes stickers on there
0:17:51.200000 - 0:17:54.360000::You're going to tam and Paula with thrown a sticker on there
0:17:55.040000 - 0:18:01.360000::That that's what I was on the cruise ship with that and I did never cleaned it out and I was using that water from the
0:18:02.200000 - 0:18:04.200000::And it got all brown inside
0:18:06.200000 - 0:18:10.800000::Then you get the corporate swag water bottles remember the
0:18:11.040000 - 0:18:16.080000::What it was like a they weren't like they're like skinny at the top and then they get that
0:18:23.200000 - 0:18:26.560000::Nate man, why would you say that skinny at the top
0:18:30.680000 - 0:18:36::Dude Nate I'm not kidding. That's a fucking good song idea. That's it. I've been thinking at the top just a side bar
0:18:37 - 0:18:43.800000::How amazing is it to like just say have an intro to a song, you know that with no music and then the beat
0:18:43.800000 - 0:18:49.440000::I've been thinking in intros two songs lately. What would be fun to anyways go ahead?
0:18:49.440000 - 0:18:53.960000::Sorry, you're breaking down history at so sorry. No, no, I mean that sounds really interesting too
0:18:53.960000 - 0:18:57.080000::But I have a couple more water bottles to talk about
0:18:57.840000 - 0:19:03.280000::I guess I'll just go really quick as this isn't interesting to you guys then we hit the hydroflask era, okay
0:19:04.280000 - 0:19:11.720000::That's essentially like a Nalgene but we're just coming out of that the hydroflask area right and now
0:19:11.720000 - 0:19:16.360000::Yeah, he's in the mix too a little bit then we get the Stanley shit going on, okay?
0:19:16.680000 - 0:19:22.440000::What's that with the straw that's the one everybody's gonna crazy about right now that I have I don't even like now
0:19:22.440000 - 0:19:25.160000::I think it's I think it is a wall of time
0:19:25.720000 - 0:19:30.280000::Get a fucking life get a fucking man. You would love the fuck out of this water bottle
0:19:30.280000 - 0:19:32.640000::This is the first one where I go the features are excellent
0:19:33.240000 - 0:19:40.160000::You could just sit it or you could chug it so you could sip on that there's a straw in there, but it doesn't stick out
0:19:40.160000 - 0:19:47.240000::It's contained we need to disrupt the water bottle industry right now and I'm calling for a satchel type of
0:19:48.680000 - 0:19:54.960000::Going on the oh dude the prairie you know what I'm talking about like a sheep skin
0:19:54.960000 - 0:20:00::Canvas one of those where you squirt it in and it's a satchel

0:20:00 - 0:20:09.120000::water model. That's made of buffalo bison stomach lining. You know, and you can barely fit any
0:20:09.120000 - 0:20:15.120000::fucking liquid in it. There's not enough justify happening. Jack's raising your hand. I'm dying to
0:20:15.120000 - 0:20:20.640000::weigh in on this thing. I knew you would let me weigh in on this. Are you talking about inventing a
0:20:20.640000 - 0:20:27.040000::product that's a new way to deliver and include water into your system? Oh, off-king. You guys have seen
0:20:27.040000 - 0:20:35.120000::these, right? Vains. Not my little fucking bumps. Vains. Yeah. This is something that you can stick
0:20:35.680000 - 0:20:41.520000::that fully looks like fucking veins. Little ass, clear, flat tubes that go all over your
0:20:41.520000 - 0:20:48.080000::fucking body. Yeah. Okay. And it goes up here. You have a little like, you know what I'm saying?
0:20:48.080000 - 0:20:53.920000::Basically, you look at water bottles. Are you saying? No, it's external. It's external veins. So
0:20:53.920000 - 0:20:58.080000::it looks like your veins are popping out on the vascular. And maybe there could be a LED on them so
0:20:58.080000 - 0:21:03.920000::you can like floor light style from fast and furious, like the fucking cars like that. You could like
0:21:03.920000 - 0:21:08.560000::light change the color of your veins and shit. And you could have water just on your camel style,
0:21:08.560000 - 0:21:13.120000::but in your veins. I'm imagining that we have Chris Katana as a guest and we have to ask him one
0:21:13.120000 - 0:21:20.960000::question and it's 20 minutes in. He's listening. He's a special guest coming up. Oh, we do have a guest.
0:21:20.960000 - 0:21:28.080000::We're recording it next Thursday. Oh, yeah. Wow. I just teased something. Fucking nuts. You guys
0:21:28.080000 - 0:21:33.360000::don't know who it is. That's so so. You want to never guess this? You wish.
0:21:34.400000 - 0:21:40.800000::Okay. So we have not done basically one celebrity. All right. Let's get into it. I have a rumor.
0:21:40.800000 - 0:21:47.520000::Fucking shit. I heard a fucking rumor. You want to hear it? Jason Mamoah. Oh, yeah. Jason Mamoah,
0:21:47.520000 - 0:21:51.200000::Lisa Bane, split, split up. Wow.
0:21:51.200000 - 0:21:55.520000::I'm curious. I always, when that happens, I wonder what happened.
0:21:58.720000 - 0:22:00.080000::I'm so sorry. You know what?
0:22:03.040000 - 0:22:11.360000::I feel like Jason Mamoah is like the modern day romance novel type of caricature of
0:22:12.160000 - 0:22:19.120000::a wild style, like a wild sexual man. Yeah. He's a probably wild creature. When you think of him,
0:22:19.120000 - 0:22:24.080000::you think he's like, he smells kind of like grimy but like in a way that it's like his
0:22:24.080000 - 0:22:30.480000::pheromones are like really getting getting to you. You know, and he's got a swing in his bedroom.
0:22:30.480000 - 0:22:37.120000::And he's like really all about the female body and pleasure in you and in this, in every type of
0:22:37.120000 - 0:22:41.280000::way, it's all about you, baby. And this is all about you, queen. You know,
0:22:42.720000 - 0:22:46.960000::is that what people think of him? He is like that, man. That's what he wants to. That's what he wants to
0:22:46.960000 - 0:22:51.760000::put out into the world with his, you know what I'm saying? Course. He looks like a guy who was doing
0:22:51.760000 - 0:22:57.600000::work from home like decades before it started and his house was just like unentered for years and
0:22:57.600000 - 0:23:03.280000::years and years by anybody but him. And it's just like, oh, yeah, man, you think about good.
0:23:03.280000 - 0:23:09.680000::Like a haircut, like your shit looks kind of nuts. Like all of your shirts smell a lot. Like,
0:23:09.680000 - 0:23:16.080000::like whatever you're cooking every night and we're worried about you. I don't get healthy vibes
0:23:16.080000 - 0:23:21.840000::when I look at Jason Mahmoha. I look at somebody who's rescued by Hollywood. I like, I won't stand for
0:23:21.840000 - 0:23:26.560000::this type of conversation. Yeah, we can talk about rumors. Yeah, we can talk about how we think
0:23:26.560000 - 0:23:32.320000::someone might be sexually playful, whatever. No, we cannot put someone down and make them feel bad
0:23:32.320000 - 0:23:36.320000::because if they listen to this, I don't want anybody to ever feel bad and not even Jason Mahmoha
0:23:36.320000 - 0:23:42.160000::Aquaman. Okay, listen, I need this draw line in the sand right there. I won't talk shit on
0:23:42.160000 - 0:23:45.920000::any but I never talk shit. I'm gonna fill that line back in. I'm gonna fill that line back in.
0:23:45.920000 - 0:23:49.040000::Sorry Nate, but I've just been called out and I need to address it. Please, thank you.
0:23:50.800000 - 0:23:56.560000::I can't help what makes somebody else feel bad. Okay, some people don't like the taste of banana
0:23:56.560000 - 0:24:02.080000::peppers. I like them on pizza. But some people you put a banana pepper near them and they want to
0:24:02.640000 - 0:24:08.240000::bring them back to a memory of their mother hurting them. That's right. So if somebody chooses to
0:24:08.240000 - 0:24:11.840000::get hurt, when I say fuck Jason Mahmoha, he looks like a fucking futon. He looks like a
0:24:11.840000 - 0:24:17.600000::fucking wet futon. He looks like, you know what I'm saying? He looks like my neighbor that I don't
0:24:17.600000 - 0:24:23.200000::let my friends look at in the eyes when we walk by. I will say if he went to a steam punk convention
0:24:23.200000 - 0:24:27.840000::and dressed up to the nines with all of them buttons and tall boots with the hell of
0:24:27.840000 - 0:24:34.480000::places and the goggles, he would be getting it like nobody else. Even if he wasn't famous,
0:24:34.480000 - 0:24:42::just walking in there six foot. That's steam punk sex. But with his burly build, yeah he looks like
0:24:42 - 0:24:47.760000::I just one of them, air balloon engineers that they have in the steam punk worlds. Oh yeah,
0:24:47.760000 - 0:24:53.360000::he's definitely. He's definitely collected some rings that fellow steam punk travelers have given
0:24:53.360000 - 0:24:59.840000::to him along his journey. Yeah, you could say that. You could.

0:25:00 - 0:25:04.160000::I'm not sure if you guys want to know their eggs.
0:25:04.160000 - 0:25:06.240000::Oh yeah, wait, didn't you have some gossip?
0:25:06.240000 - 0:25:08.800000::Oh yeah, here's some gossip.
0:25:08.800000 - 0:25:11.880000::Robert Downey Jr. says his Iron Man performance
0:25:11.880000 - 0:25:15.320000::in Marvel movies is some of his greatest acting work.
0:25:15.320000 - 0:25:18.160000::Quote, it went a little bit unnoticed
0:25:18.160000 - 0:25:19.600000::because of the genre.
0:25:21.280000 - 0:25:22.640000::That's what I'm hearing.
0:25:22.640000 - 0:25:24.360000::That's the rumor I'm hearing.
0:25:24.360000 - 0:25:26.520000::The rumor is that Robert Downey Jr. thinks
0:25:26.520000 - 0:25:29.280000::people aren't giving him enough respect for Iron Man.
0:25:29.320000 - 0:25:30.680000::Yeah.
0:25:30.680000 - 0:25:33::Well, that's interesting.
0:25:33 - 0:25:34.480000::So I would just get that.
0:25:34.480000 - 0:25:36.760000::I know, I'm glad he said that because a lot of people
0:25:36.760000 - 0:25:39.800000::would just let that slide.
0:25:39.800000 - 0:25:42.800000::I'm saying dude, take your fucking check.
0:25:42.800000 - 0:25:44.040000::Was that enough?
0:25:44.040000 - 0:25:44.880000::Is that enough?
0:25:44.880000 - 0:25:46.120000::Why do you need praise?
0:25:46.120000 - 0:25:47.880000::I just brought this up on the last episode
0:25:47.880000 - 0:25:49.360000::of the fucking The Cinematic Achievement Award.
0:25:49.360000 - 0:25:50.640000::You got your fucking check.
0:25:50.640000 - 0:25:51.880000::You got the bag.
0:25:51.880000 - 0:25:53.360000::You get nothing more than you.
0:25:53.360000 - 0:25:54.320000::You don't get praise.
0:25:54.320000 - 0:25:55.680000::You chose the bag.
0:25:55.680000 - 0:25:58.400000::You didn't choose the praise, all right?
0:25:58.400000 - 0:25:59.240000::Yeah.
0:25:59.240000 - 0:26:00.560000::That's right.
0:26:00.560000 - 0:26:01.400000::It's right.
0:26:01.400000 - 0:26:03.440000::You can't let yourself eat cake, right?
0:26:03.440000 - 0:26:05.360000::That's what that means, right?
0:26:05.360000 - 0:26:07.080000::I think so.
0:26:07.080000 - 0:26:09.480000::I think that's what that means.
0:26:09.480000 - 0:26:11.320000::But let me just say this
0:26:11.320000 - 0:26:13.040000::because I don't want to throw praise on this guy
0:26:13.040000 - 0:26:14.720000::that seems to need it so bad.
0:26:14.720000 - 0:26:17.680000::But that first Iron Man movie,
0:26:17.680000 - 0:26:20.200000::shhh, shhh, shhh,
0:26:20.200000 - 0:26:21.040000::pretty good.
0:26:21.040000 - 0:26:22.040000::It's your life.
0:26:22.040000 - 0:26:26.040000::And when Iron Man plays in that movie,
0:26:26.880000 - 0:26:29.880000::I don't know.
0:26:29.880000 - 0:26:32.120000::Oh, you're doing the Iron Man.
0:26:32.120000 - 0:26:34.360000::I'm getting not kidding you.
0:26:34.360000 - 0:26:36.040000::Singing that just gave me chills.
0:26:36.040000 - 0:26:37.680000::Oh, don't.
0:26:37.680000 - 0:26:39.280000::Don't tell me something, Eric.
0:26:39.280000 - 0:26:40.760000::You need to go out there.
0:26:40.760000 - 0:26:41.600000::You need to go out there.
0:26:41.600000 - 0:26:42.600000::That's not good news.
0:26:42.600000 - 0:26:46::You do have, and I'm not saying this to be fucking edgy
0:26:46 - 0:26:46.760000::or anything, man.
0:26:46.760000 - 0:26:47.520000::I hate to even say it,
0:26:47.520000 - 0:26:52.120000::but you do have a mutation or a variant of autism
0:26:52.120000 - 0:26:55.440000::because you spoke about water bottles for 31 minutes.
0:26:55.440000 - 0:26:59.880000::You met the history of water bottles over the last two decades.
0:26:59.880000 - 0:27:01.040000::And then you gave it used,
0:27:01.040000 - 0:27:03.480000::and then you started stimming when you sang Iron Man.
0:27:03.480000 - 0:27:05.680000::I don't know.
0:27:05.680000 - 0:27:06.880000::So, you know what?
0:27:06.880000 - 0:27:08.960000::I think I'm just bad thing.
0:27:08.960000 - 0:27:11.120000::It's why we love you, in fact.
0:27:11.120000 - 0:27:14.160000::Yeah, maybe that's something I need to ponder on.
0:27:14.160000 - 0:27:20.160000::I mean, you may be right, but when he comes out of that,
0:27:20.160000 - 0:27:22.600000::that, that, that, that, that,
0:27:22.960000 - 0:27:28.200000::and he's in the, he's built out the Iron Man suit out of metal
0:27:28.200000 - 0:27:29.720000::in the fucking cave.
0:27:29.720000 - 0:27:30.560000::Remember that?
0:27:30.560000 - 0:27:31.920000::And it's like a janky Iron Man.
0:27:31.920000 - 0:27:34.520000::I don't remember a goddamn thing.
0:27:34.520000 - 0:27:35.400000::I think I saw that.
0:27:35.400000 - 0:27:38.080000::Oh, well, then you need to be very brain-changed.
0:27:38.080000 - 0:27:41.040000::I remember eating popcorn in there.
0:27:41.040000 - 0:27:42.280000::So, isn't it ironic?
0:27:42.280000 - 0:27:44.560000::Well, first of all, why'd they go with Iron?
0:27:44.560000 - 0:27:46.320000::Because there's way hell of stronger metals
0:27:46.320000 - 0:27:47.160000::that I could lay in.
0:27:47.160000 - 0:27:48.400000::Collatium right off the back.
0:27:48.400000 - 0:27:48.940000::Would you say,
0:27:48.940000 - 0:27:49.720000::collatium.
0:27:49.720000 - 0:27:50.720000::Collatium.
0:27:50.720000 - 0:27:51.760000::Collatium.
0:27:51.800000 - 0:27:52.600000::Is that fake?
0:27:52.600000 - 0:27:53.680000::No, I just made that up.
0:27:53.680000 - 0:27:54.680000::That's, it doesn't sound like that.
0:27:54.680000 - 0:27:55.600000::You know what I though?
0:27:55.600000 - 0:27:56.680000::You know what I fucking like.
0:27:56.680000 - 0:27:59.840000::I know I'm a pig, a pig iron.
0:27:59.840000 - 0:28:01.040000::What's that?
0:28:01.040000 - 0:28:01.880000::Is that a food?
0:28:01.880000 - 0:28:03.920000::Pig iron, I think is some type of,
0:28:05.720000 - 0:28:08.280000::some type of kind of busted iron.
0:28:08.280000 - 0:28:10::That's just like easy to make.
0:28:10 - 0:28:11.240000::There's something in there.
0:28:11.240000 - 0:28:12.080000::Right.
0:28:12.080000 - 0:28:17::So, if any steel workers, metal workers know what pig iron is.
0:28:17 - 0:28:17.840000::Let us know.
0:28:17.840000 - 0:28:18.760000::Come on the podcast.
0:28:18.760000 - 0:28:20::We want to pick your brain.
0:28:20.920000 - 0:28:25.240000::Eric wants to read another 30 minute Wikipedia chunk.
0:28:25.240000 - 0:28:27.280000::Lightning us to his latest interest.
0:28:28.720000 - 0:28:30::Well, this is fucking interesting.
0:28:30 - 0:28:31::I'm fucking with you, man.
0:28:31 - 0:28:33.680000::This was interesting me this room right here.
0:28:33.680000 - 0:28:34.520000::What could it be?
0:28:34.520000 - 0:28:36.720000::You know, we don't, we never talk about this person.
0:28:36.720000 - 0:28:38.400000::I think ever on the podcast.
0:28:38.400000 - 0:28:43.400000::So, and Taylor Swift and Travis Kelsey,
0:28:43.920000 - 0:28:48.120000::I feel like they get so much press, so much,
0:28:48.960000 - 0:28:53.960000::like media attention is thwarted towards this relationship
0:28:55.880000 - 0:28:58.440000::in a disproportionate way, in my opinion.
0:28:58.440000 - 0:29:03.440000::But they said they have no plans to get engaged soon.
0:29:03.440000 - 0:29:06.040000::And I'm saying, let's start with the band dating.
0:29:06.040000 - 0:29:10.240000::That really disturbs me to not be having any plans
0:29:10.240000 - 0:29:11.080000::to be able to get.
0:29:11.080000 - 0:29:11.920000::Why?
0:29:11.920000 - 0:29:13.880000::Because of their age or what?
0:29:13.880000 - 0:29:17.720000::It just, it just seems to me to highlight a dark path
0:29:18 - 0:29:20.120000::that a lot of couples in this country are going down.
0:29:20.120000 - 0:29:22.520000::Oh, we don't need to become married.
0:29:22.520000 - 0:29:26.080000::Oh, we don't need this ancient tradition of bonding
0:29:26.080000 - 0:29:27.640000::in a ceremony.
0:29:27.640000 - 0:29:30.080000::Yeah, see what fucking happens if you stay together
0:29:30.080000 - 0:29:31.800000::for too long, become domestic partners.
0:29:31.800000 - 0:29:33.160000::See what hell you'll enter.
0:29:35.160000 - 0:29:36.200000::Yeah, play your games.
0:29:36.200000 - 0:29:37.040000::Have a little fun.
0:29:37.040000 - 0:29:38.040000::Don't make that commitment.
0:29:38.040000 - 0:29:39.120000::See what happens.
0:29:40.120000 - 0:29:43.400000::They are dedicating their lives to Satan.
0:29:43.400000 - 0:29:46.160000::And then it is interesting to not get married
0:29:46.160000 - 0:29:48.480000::after all these years of human beings doing it.
0:29:48.480000 - 0:29:49.880000::They didn't stop doing it.
0:29:49.880000 - 0:29:51.920000::If you don't want to taste one of the best flavors
0:29:51.920000 - 0:29:54.920000::that the human God version of Ben and Jerry's
0:29:54.920000 - 0:29:58.320000::or something that I'm trying to say like that has made.
0:29:58.320000 - 0:29:59.160000::Yeah, we get you.
0:29:59.160000 - 0:30:00::So be my guest.

0:30:00 - 0:30:08.280000::I do want to bring this up as you bring up Satan. I feel like Travis Kelsey has whatever sort of deal there is whether it is like
0:30:08.960000 - 0:30:14.360000::You know, I don't know what happens behind those closed doors with the illuminati deal type of thing
0:30:14.360000 - 0:30:21.360000::But I feel like Travis Kelsey has made that deal whatever that is he just all of a sudden started

0:33:02.840000 - 0:33:08.680000::Pain for a horse for horses. I gotta be honest horses don't really do it for me in terms of
0:33:09.840000 - 0:33:12.880000::You're not right. Nate. I feel like you'd be afraid of a horse
0:33:13.880000 - 0:33:19.840000::You got too close to a horse. I feel like you would feel fear I know like you know how you you

0:33:54.480000 - 0:34:00.040000::You wouldn't feel bad about that if you were out on the racetrack and nobody had the courage to take this part of me Nate
0:34:02 - 0:34:09.680000::You like burgers. No, it's that you haven't had the time if you put your forehead to a horse's forehead just for five seconds

0:52:42.480000 - 0:52:46.200000::Chop it up and that kind of just looked like shorter Barry's in cream.
0:52:46.200000 - 0:52:50.920000::And then I had my mom kind of chop up the sides and it's still just looked all not quite

0:53:06.280000 - 0:53:10.200000::Like there was a glitch going on inside of the barber shop where we would be having a
0:53:10.200000 - 0:53:11.200000::glitch in.
0:53:11.200000 - 0:53:12.200000::Yeah.

0:53:21.520000 - 0:53:23.920000::But what we were talking, just talking having a great conversation.
0:53:23.920000 - 0:53:28.440000::I said, what were we talking about haircuts and how cutting hairs like one of the oldest
0:53:28.440000 - 0:53:30.800000::professions to exist in humanity.
0:53:30.800000 - 0:53:34.240000::And it's really a spiritual thing for him and he loves doing it and making people feel
0:53:34.240000 - 0:53:35.240000::right.
0:53:35.240000 - 0:53:36.240000::Yeah.
0:53:36.240000 - 0:53:39.720000::I was just rocking with him and we were talking and he's so cool.
0:53:39.720000 - 0:53:44.400000::And then I think I just said like, yeah, did you hear about the, are like, yeah, oh, yeah,
0:53:44.400000 - 0:53:45.400000::man.
0:53:45.400000 - 0:53:46.760000::Oh, wait, did you see the cat Williams interview?
0:53:46.760000 - 0:53:53.520000::And then there was this really like unexplained moment of silence in the whole barber shop where
0:53:53.520000 - 0:53:55.760000::it seemed like everything paused.
0:53:55.760000 - 0:54:00.320000::And I was like, what the fuck is going on?
0:54:00.320000 - 0:54:04.680000::And then all of a sudden he responded and it truly felt like somebody had hit pause and
0:54:04.680000 - 0:54:06.840000::then he started talking again and I was like, you know who did that?
0:54:06.840000 - 0:54:07.840000::Oh, yeah.
0:54:07.840000 - 0:54:08.840000::You know who hit pause?

0:54:19.920000 - 0:54:22.120000::He is like a Jiminy cricket type of figure.
0:54:22.120000 - 0:54:23.640000::It could have also been right.
0:54:23.640000 - 0:54:24.640000::Have you all seen that?

0:54:36.600000 - 0:54:41.320000::They're messing with the wrong people because if America couldn't even take out Afghanistan,
0:54:41.320000 - 0:54:44.440000::I mean, good luck to the aliens.
0:54:44.440000 - 0:54:46.240000::Jellyfish, space ship.
0:54:46.240000 - 0:54:50.320000::I'll show you right after this end and you're going to have to read the sentence.
0:54:50.320000 - 0:54:54.040000::Did you see the 10 foot alien in Brazil on the hike?
0:54:54.040000 - 0:54:58.040000::Yeah, I did see that on the top mount top, but I feel like you can see the strings where
0:54:58.040000 - 0:54:58.880000::it looks like a puppet.

0:55:00 - 0:55:01.760000::I'm looking at the yellow fish right now.
0:55:01.760000 - 0:55:03.120000::I was gonna be a real guy.

0:56:42.840000 - 0:56:45.640000::Well, I think it has to be making that chicken tinga
0:56:45.640000 - 0:56:47.720000::in the instant pot last night.
0:56:47.720000 - 0:56:49.080000::So easy.
0:56:49.080000 - 0:56:52.120000::You could either boil it in a big pot and then shred it,
0:56:52.120000 - 0:56:54.320000::or you could just put it all in an instant pot
0:56:54.320000 - 0:56:58.720000::for 12 minutes, make the sauce on the side, then go crazy.
0:56:58.720000 - 0:56:59.920000::Okay.
0:56:59.920000 - 0:57:00.760000::That is easy.
0:57:00.760000 - 0:57:02.640000::Look up, chicken tinga, New York Times recipe.
0:57:02.640000 - 0:57:03.520000::Throw that in the cell.
0:57:03.520000 - 0:57:04.720000::Throw that in a bowl.
0:57:04.720000 - 0:57:08.120000::Put it in a burrito, whatever you'd like.
0:57:08.120000 - 0:57:09.880000::You got leftovers too?
0:57:09.880000 - 0:57:11::Oh, yeah.

0:57:12.240000 - 0:57:13.400000::Oh, yeah.
0:57:13.400000 - 0:57:14.840000::Are you going to eat them?
0:57:14.840000 - 0:57:16.920000::I think I am right after this.
0:57:16.920000 - 0:57:17.680000::Mm.
0:57:17.680000 - 0:57:19.040000::Yep.
0:57:19.040000 - 0:57:20.560000::And I'm not stalling trying to think.
0:57:20.560000 - 0:57:22.120000::Well, should I go now?
0:57:22.120000 - 0:57:22.960000::I could just try.
0:57:22.960000 - 0:57:23.800000::Go now.
0:57:24 - 0:57:27.680000::So I went to see a documentary last night,
0:57:27.680000 - 0:57:29.720000::and it was presented by Friend of the Podcast.

0:57:31.880000 - 0:57:36.680000::And I can't really talk about what the documentary was.
0:57:36.680000 - 0:57:40::It was like a private screening for this doc.
0:57:40 - 0:57:44.840000::But it was just, I can't tell you how much I loved watching this.
0:57:44.840000 - 0:57:46.080000::And it felt special.
0:57:46.080000 - 0:57:49.840000::It was something that like can't be released to the public.
0:57:49.840000 - 0:57:52.920000::And it was just, it was so, and what was the,
0:57:52.920000 - 0:57:54.360000::I need to give this place a shout out.

0:58:08.840000 - 0:58:10::Just looking at the house.
0:58:10 - 0:58:14.440000::Oh shit, my mic is, but anyways, it was just a lovely event.
0:58:14.440000 - 0:58:16.400000::And I just had a fucking blast.
0:58:16.400000 - 0:58:22.640000::Oh, it's called the Now Instant Image Hall.
0:58:22.640000 - 0:58:24.800000::It was in Chinatown, LA.
0:58:24.800000 - 0:58:30::So they have a lot of like cool movies and screenings.
0:58:30 - 0:58:33.640000::It's a bookstore and it was just a really awesome space.

0:58:45.360000 - 0:58:46.720000::With Gabapentin.
0:58:46.720000 - 0:58:47.960000::With Gabapentin.
0:58:47.960000 - 0:58:49.680000::Oh, you were there for round one.
0:58:49.680000 - 0:58:50.440000::Yeah.
0:58:50.440000 - 0:58:52.520000::Wait, did you get all sleepy?
0:58:52.520000 - 0:58:53.360000::Nope.
0:58:53.360000 - 0:58:54.160000::It didn't work on her.
0:58:54.160000 - 0:58:56.600000::Gabapentin alone, I feel like doesn't.
0:58:56.600000 - 0:58:58.680000::Is that thing the bubbles is on?
0:58:58.680000 - 0:58:59.880000::Yeah, bubbles is on it.
0:58:59.880000 - 0:59:02.040000::Yeah, bubbles on Gabapentin.
0:59:02.040000 - 0:59:03.840000::What do you mean she's on everything, man?
0:59:03.840000 - 0:59:05::Every day she's on it?
0:59:05 - 0:59:05.840000::Yeah.
0:59:05.840000 - 0:59:07.120000::Holy shit.
0:59:07.120000 - 0:59:09.600000::But frankly, I don't think the Gabapentin
0:59:09.600000 - 0:59:12.240000::is that crazy effective on her.
0:59:12.240000 - 0:59:16.240000::Yeah, well, definitely is not that effective at all on our cat birdie.
0:59:16.240000 - 0:59:18.640000::Because when we gave her that first dose,
0:59:18.640000 - 0:59:22.280000::and she was basically like, DBC style, like absorbed it,
0:59:22.280000 - 0:59:24.960000::and then spit it back out, and it turned into actually more arms.
0:59:24.960000 - 0:59:26.120000::You know what I'm saying?
0:59:26.120000 - 0:59:26.960000::Good girl.
0:59:26.960000 - 0:59:28.120000::You can't tame cats, man.
0:59:28.120000 - 0:59:29.120000::You can't.
0:59:29.120000 - 0:59:31.120000::You can't tame cats, man.
0:59:31.120000 - 0:59:32.440000::But it was fun.
0:59:32.440000 - 0:59:35.800000::I love, because I don't, I generally respect her physical space,
0:59:35.800000 - 0:59:38::because she doesn't like to be petted too much
0:59:38 - 0:59:38.880000::or cuttle-learned anything.
0:59:38.880000 - 0:59:39.880000::Oh, really?
0:59:39.880000 - 0:59:40.400000::Right.
0:59:40.400000 - 0:59:43.120000::And so when I do get to get the okay from my girlfriend
0:59:43.120000 - 0:59:45.160000::to go and wrestle this fucking cat,
0:59:45.160000 - 0:59:47.360000::and pick it up like a little baby and put it on my lap.
0:59:47.360000 - 0:59:49.960000::Is she not shredding your arms?
0:59:49.960000 - 0:59:50.760000::You know what?
0:59:50.760000 - 0:59:53.240000::She's not, because I'm grabbing them.
0:59:53.240000 - 0:59:54.640000::Nice.
0:59:54.640000 - 0:59:57.920000::Yeah, but she is kind of rocking back and forth.
0:59:57.920000 - 0:59:59.920000::Yo, so that's what gave me joy is.
