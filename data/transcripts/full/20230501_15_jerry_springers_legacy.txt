0:00:34 - 0:00:36::It's a somber one.
0:00:36 - 0:00:40::We lost somebody close to us, somebody who raised us,
0:00:40 - 0:00:45::somebody who helped us get through lunch, helped us when we were sick,
0:00:45 - 0:00:47::and home from school.
0:00:47 - 0:00:51::Somebody who helped us discover our sexualities,
0:00:51 - 0:00:58::as uncomfortable as it is to say, and discover mistakes that can be made
0:00:59 - 0:01:02::through learning about other people making mistakes instead of having to go through
0:01:02 - 0:01:04::them ourselves.
0:01:04 - 0:01:06::And that person is Jerry Springer.
0:01:06 - 0:01:13::Gerald Springer passed away very badly, passed away very painfully at the age of
0:01:13 - 0:01:15::what did he pass away from?
0:01:15 - 0:01:17::Something in his seventh pancreatic cancer.
0:01:17 - 0:01:22::Oh my goodness, I heard that just what they're saying in the news with that.
0:01:22 - 0:01:24::What?
0:01:24 - 0:01:25::What did you hear?
0:01:25 - 0:01:26::What did you hear?
0:01:26 - 0:01:29::I heard somebody from the show was mad at him and came in.
0:01:29 - 0:01:33::He was about to die from pancreatic cancer, and they came in with a baseball bat
0:01:33 - 0:01:34::and let him know.
0:01:34 - 0:01:38::No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't even joke about that.
0:01:38 - 0:01:39::I wish I was joking.
0:01:39 - 0:01:41::I wish I was joking, man.
0:01:41 - 0:01:42::I wish I was joking, man.
0:01:42 - 0:01:48::You're instinct to go make light of someone being dead.
0:01:48 - 0:01:50::This is the problem with comedians.
0:01:50 - 0:01:51::Oh, wow.
0:01:51 - 0:01:55::Y'all cannot fucking just be serious for one fucking second.
0:01:55 - 0:01:57::We're trying to have a moment right now.
0:01:57 - 0:02:03::I'm trying to fucking, I'm trying to put somebody I looked up to and we're trying to pay respect
0:02:03 - 0:02:05::to your, and you can't help but make a fucking joke about it.
0:02:05 - 0:02:06::You know what?
0:02:06 - 0:02:07::That's just so awesome.
0:02:07 - 0:02:08::I'm sorry.
0:02:08 - 0:02:09::I'm a comedian.
0:02:09 - 0:02:10::It's what I do.
0:02:10 - 0:02:13::I just fucking joke, man, no matter what.
0:02:13 - 0:02:14::Like, you just can't strike me down.
0:02:14 - 0:02:15::It doesn't matter what.
0:02:15 - 0:02:20::So I do it out of respect, but I do it out of the love for the craft and making jokes about somebody
0:02:20 - 0:02:23::is how I show that I love them post you mislead.
0:02:23 - 0:02:24::Well, that's right.
0:02:24 - 0:02:25::That's right.
0:02:25 - 0:02:26::We got about that.
0:02:26 - 0:02:27::That's how we kind of show love.
0:02:27 - 0:02:31::Whereas people, you know, other people will, you know, be kind of somber and respectful,
0:02:31 - 0:02:32::but comedians got to go in.
0:02:32 - 0:02:33::What?
0:02:33 - 0:02:34::You're dead.
0:02:34 - 0:02:35::Jerry Springer.
0:02:35 - 0:02:37::That's how we show respect.
0:02:37 - 0:02:39::You know, in a weird way.
0:02:39 - 0:02:40::Totally.
0:02:40 - 0:02:41::But a lot of people can't get that.
0:02:41 - 0:02:42::I'm a comedian.
0:02:42 - 0:02:44::So why come or why?
0:02:44 - 0:02:49::Why do I deal with this so much more reverently?
0:02:50 - 0:02:52::Because you're not a comedian there.
0:02:52 - 0:02:56::Well, you mean by that, dude?
0:02:56 - 0:02:59::You, my friend, are an artist.
0:02:59 - 0:03:00::Artist.
0:03:00 - 0:03:05::Why did I always think I'll be an artist and I didn't know how to paint.
0:03:05 - 0:03:06::I did not draw.
0:03:06 - 0:03:07::He's so bad at it.
0:03:07 - 0:03:08::He's calling.
0:03:08 - 0:03:10::Literally, he tried so hard.
0:03:10 - 0:03:14::I made me the worst drawer around.
0:03:14 - 0:03:17::Oh, my handwriting is so busted.
0:03:18 - 0:03:20::I have no hand.
0:03:20 - 0:03:22::I went to a handwriting tutor.
0:03:22 - 0:03:24::Did you guys ever have to go to this?
0:03:24 - 0:03:26::I went to school, but no, never a tutor.
0:03:26 - 0:03:30::No, I went to a place just for my handwriting because it was so fucking bad.
0:03:30 - 0:03:33::And they said there's nothing we can do for him after about eight hours with me.
0:03:33 - 0:03:35::We got to put him down.
0:03:35 - 0:03:36::Well, you know this area.
0:03:36 - 0:03:37::What?
0:03:37 - 0:03:40::Opposite to track because guess what?
0:03:40 - 0:03:43::I won a handwriting contest.
0:03:43 - 0:03:44::Oh, no.
0:03:44 - 0:03:45::Oh, no.
0:03:45 - 0:03:46::Oh.
0:03:46 - 0:03:47::Third grade, man.
0:03:47 - 0:03:48::No.
0:03:48 - 0:03:49::And guess what?
0:03:49 - 0:03:51::I am an excellent drawer.
0:03:51 - 0:03:53::You are an excellent drawer.
0:03:53 - 0:03:54::You're a wonderful drawer.
0:03:54 - 0:03:55::Drarer.
0:03:55 - 0:03:58::Yeah, let's just say I got you a start, Nate.
0:03:58 - 0:04:00::Well, that's a good question.
0:04:00 - 0:04:07::It actually stemmed from my sister was into drawing and I thought everything was a competition
0:04:07 - 0:04:10.840000::when I was a little kid and I was like, okay, I'm going to try and be better than you
0:04:10.840000 - 0:04:12::at everything that you're doing.
0:04:12 - 0:04:16::So she was kind of getting attention for being the drawer and I was like, watch this
0:04:16 - 0:04:17::shit.
0:04:17 - 0:04:21::So I went into the lab and I fucking worked on my technique and I came out and I was like,
0:04:21 - 0:04:24::guess what, Mel, I'm better than you.
0:04:24 - 0:04:26::And you're your whole thing that you're an artist.
0:04:26 - 0:04:29::Now it's on now I'm the artist in the family.
0:04:29 - 0:04:31::Kind of sadistic, huh?
0:04:31 - 0:04:32::Did it work?
0:04:32 - 0:04:36::Did she like never dare touch our ever again?
0:04:36 - 0:04:37::It did.
0:04:37 - 0:04:38::It actually did.
0:04:38 - 0:04:43::I like there was a there was drawing and video games were two of things that she was
0:04:43 - 0:04:51::into and then I was like, I made it into a competition and then kind of sourd the creative
0:04:51 - 0:04:54::act for both of those things for her.
0:04:54 - 0:04:55::Right.
0:04:55 - 0:04:58::Just because I was really competitive as a as a child for some reason.
0:04:58 - 0:05:00::And yet you do them both both of

0:05:00 - 0:05:03.480000::these things beautifully, man, both your video games and your art.
0:05:03.760000 - 0:05:09.920000::So that be a lesson that you may start into a process for bad reasons,
0:05:10.720000 - 0:05:18::but down the line, you may be experiencing all that harmoniously,
0:05:18 - 0:05:24.840000::enjoyfully. Right. Right. Like you might. No, yeah, it sounds like,
0:05:25.080000 - 0:05:27.840000::it sounds like you're listening to someone that you don't know that is like a
0:05:27.840000 - 0:05:31.200000::big, penier work and it's trying to tell you a big cause. Or you're like,
0:05:31.640000 - 0:05:33.920000::just trying to appease them like, right, right, right.
0:05:33.920000 - 0:05:37.640000::And of course, right. Anyway, it's a nice meeting, man. Yeah.
0:05:37.640000 - 0:05:42.840000::So anytime that'll be 250 for the hour and then life coaching, you know,
0:05:42.840000 - 0:05:45.840000::we'll do that in my house next time. Right. Right.
0:05:47.120000 - 0:05:50.720000::God, what do you all say when you're not listening? I'm hungry. Wait, what?
0:05:52.320000 - 0:05:54.240000::You just said it then. That's the answer.
0:05:54.400000 - 0:05:58.640000::Is it interesting? I'm you say I'm hungry or I'm tired.
0:05:59.520000 - 0:06:04.680000::All the time. That's my mantra. That's my mantra. I'm tired. I'm tired.
0:06:06.840000 - 0:06:13.440000::Rest in peace, Jerry Springer. RIP, dude, a fellow high one, you know what I'm saying?
0:06:13.440000 - 0:06:19.720000::Yeah, then what was his legacy? His legacy was he was, he was a statesman and he was a freak,
0:06:20 - 0:06:22.480000::right. Well, he was the mayor of, I guess, in Sinetti.
0:06:23.160000 - 0:06:25.760000::And he was a bit too much of a freak. Freak. Freak.
0:06:25.760000 - 0:06:31.240000::He was a daytime freak, the daytime freak. He's kind of a bad man, but instead of a bat,
0:06:31.240000 - 0:06:37.720000::he turned to a freaky little man with some activities going on against.
0:06:37.720000 - 0:06:42.680000::I mean, he really did change the landscape of daytime TV because we have before that,
0:06:42.680000 - 0:06:48.280000::we have fucking Barbara Walters, Regis Philbin. Like it's just a good, clean fun for the,
0:06:48.600000 - 0:06:53.160000::you know, whoever's around a daytime and it was like, yo, there's a bunch of freaks that are like
0:06:53.160000 - 0:06:57.560000::watching TV right now. Like where's our shit? You know what I'm saying? That's what he did.
0:06:57.560000 - 0:07:02.760000::He was like, you know how many freaks are watching network TV at 2 p.m.
0:07:03.480000 - 0:07:07.880000::Almost all of them that don't want to watch Ellen, you know, all of them very much.
0:07:07.880000 - 0:07:10.120000::They're forced to watch this fucking bullshit.
0:07:10.120000 - 0:07:13.640000::We want to see people grab each other by the hair and mop the floor with their sweat.
0:07:14.520000 - 0:07:19.720000::Kind of. I've legit used to watch a lot of Jerry Springer. Yeah, I did too.
0:07:21 - 0:07:25.240000::I would watch it if there was like a mass shooting in Virginia or something and we all had to go home.
0:07:26.920000 - 0:07:30.440000::Right. It was kind of like special occasions when you were a little kid.
0:07:32.680000 - 0:07:38.520000::I would fake sick. I would fake sick so often to not go to school. So I was very familiar with
0:07:39.240000 - 0:07:45.800000::prices right. Jerry Springer reading Rainbow. Additionally, I was watching shows.
0:07:46.520000 - 0:07:49.960000::I think we talked about this on a earlier episode, but we didn't have cable. So we just had
0:07:50.760000 - 0:07:56.840000::you know, regular network TV. So we had PBS. And I was watching shows for children way past the
0:07:56.840000 - 0:08:03.560000::age that I should have been. So your advance? Uh, no, no. The opposite where I was watching them.
0:08:03.560000 - 0:08:10.040000::You were past the age to be like, damn, I wonder what DW's up to.
0:08:10.440000 - 0:08:16.120000::But don't you feel like getting those, you got those fundamentals so crazy on lock now?
0:08:16.120000 - 0:08:20.920000::Like, oh, somebody's smiling. That means they're happy or if it's raining, I'm going to need umbrella.
0:08:22.360000 - 0:08:26.040000::Right, right. I guess I do. Do you have that down really?
0:08:26.040000 - 0:08:29.560000::Because people say that about you that you have the fundamentals on lock here.
0:08:29.560000 - 0:08:35.160000::I have the kind of fundamentals of being functional. Yeah. Yeah.
0:08:36.280000 - 0:08:42.040000::Like, uh, don't be selfish. It's like a big lesson that you might learn in one of those shows.
0:08:43.080000 - 0:08:48.040000::Right. Don't be sharing sharing is important cleaning. Yeah. Yeah.
0:08:48.040000 - 0:08:53.880000::Sharing is so it's crazy important. And when I see someone not sharing, I want it.
0:08:54.520000 - 0:09:03.560000::It makes you make me go crazy. Yeah. Sharing is like, uh, sharing is the whole point of
0:09:03.560000 - 0:09:10.280000::existence. You share, we're sharing right now. We're sharing thoughts and ideas are like, you know,
0:09:12.040000 - 0:09:17.560000::sharing. Well, that's all I can think of. I don't know. Is there a version of sharing that you
0:09:17.560000 - 0:09:22.120000::could do where you're not profiting off of it? Because like, we're profiting off of this version
0:09:22.120000 - 0:09:26.920000::of sharing. I can't think of any. But the way we profit is different. You know what I'm saying?
0:09:26.920000 - 0:09:30.840000::Yes, we are making money, but it's like, it feels like different. You know what I'm saying?
0:09:30.840000 - 0:09:36.440000::Like, because it's going back into. It feels like, like a phone over and over again.
0:09:36.840000 - 0:09:41.400000::Right. It feels kind of like how you tied that church. You know what I'm saying? Like, it's a
0:09:41.400000 - 0:09:47.160000::cheerful, you have to be, it's a cheerful giving. You know, it's not like a, uh, utilities bill.
0:09:47.160000 - 0:09:56.120000::Tive, tithing, which is in Christian churches, you give 10% of your income. Oh, shit.
0:09:56.120000 - 0:09:59.880000::A church. You have to do with the smile on your face. This is not an

0:10:00 - 0:10:04.880000::Doge is here. Here's 10% of my fucking Wendy's check right right
0:10:06.280000 - 0:10:11.720000::Jesus it's just so man the church some churches are so predatory
0:10:13.320000 - 0:10:15.320000::Yeah, you need to relax
0:10:16.040000 - 0:10:20.120000::Hey people wonder why atheism is dominating the charts right now
0:10:20.640000 - 0:10:26.840000::Godless America is coming around because people are tired of this nonsense the church has been doing for years
0:10:27.480000 - 0:10:34.840000::Yeah, look at spot like the movie spotlight and the cross is a shape people are sick of I mean all our top celebrities right now are

0:10:50.320000 - 0:10:55.120000::Yes, we have separation of church and state but like God matters and Justin Timberlake's out here being like dude
0:10:55.280000 - 0:11:00.560000::No, and I'm my if my kids say under God when they stand for the pledge. They're not my kids

0:11:49.580000 - 0:11:51.580000::Oh

0:12:39.740000 - 0:12:47.740000::You know and they all are so fucking crazy about how good you did in the short films and they love the fuck out of you
0:12:48.060000 - 0:12:53.300000::And then you get booked like booked and busy like crazy. Yeah, Eric. Can I ask you a question?
0:12:55.100000 - 0:13:01.780000::When I mean I feel like everyone's kind of wondering this, but you've been doing short films for decades now
0:13:01.780000 - 0:13:03.780000::Yeah, about probably
0:13:03.780000 - 0:13:12.900000::You've been doing so many and it's I mean it's going really well like everyone's loving the work that you've been
0:13:12.900000 - 0:13:17.220000::Right doing and it's weird to feel heat on your name, you know, right?
0:13:17.220000 - 0:13:23.220000::Right, you I work in silence. I move in silence and I wear a metaphorical
0:13:23.220000 - 0:13:30.540000::Swole cover, you know what I mean like a big sweatshirt over my muscles. So nobody knows how good I'm getting right right pump
0:13:30.540000 - 0:13:38.940000::And oh the pump cover yeah, right, but what I want what I think everyone wants to know is like you know when are you going to make the leap to
0:13:39.820000 - 0:13:47.780000::Something that's longer some someone say you know a feature film when would you be possibly making that sort of leap
0:13:48.900000 - 0:13:50.900000::Some may say I can never speak about that
0:13:51.940000 - 0:13:56.380000::Well, or and you might actually just have to find that out on Deadline.com
0:14:00.540000 - 0:14:02.540000::I
0:14:02.540000 - 0:14:04.540000::You don't know what deadline is
0:14:04.540000 - 0:14:09.900000::Jack dude, I might be thinking a day line. I'm thinking a day line. I must be is that something is that some
0:14:10.940000 - 0:14:15.460000::I need a media literacy bootcamp for one year. I need it
0:14:17.460000 - 0:14:21.260000::No, it's not but I feel like you're savant like with certain you two you
0:14:21.780000 - 0:14:23.780000::You are in just a different corner of media
0:14:23.780000 - 0:14:30.500000::That's the truth here's a true media. I a lot of people a lot of people's brains and ears
0:14:30.540000 - 0:14:35.420000::And ability to understand things is a very wide vacuum
0:14:35.620000 - 0:14:43.300000::It's a big hole and a wide vacuum with a soft pressure where they can take a little bit of everything in but my knowledge is
0:14:44.340000 - 0:14:50.780000::Like a basically reverse laser beam sniper rifle where I'm not gonna see or understand just about anything
0:14:50.780000 - 0:14:57.580000::In the entire world, but if something comes into my line of sight where I want to know about it

0:15:00 - 0:15:06.380000::It's gonna fucking black hole into my mind to the point where I'm immediately gonna be what basically almost a
0:15:07.360000 - 0:15:09.360000::Thought leader in the subject
0:15:09.720000 - 0:15:12.320000::Right, right so for example

0:19:19.200000 - 0:19:23.760000::I don't like that when when when I hear about like you're doing your thing
0:19:23.760000 - 0:19:27.080000::You're going through the Eric Raheel method of acting, you know
0:19:27.080000 - 0:19:32.520000::You have your own kind of school and you develop your own style and I hear about after you know
0:19:32.520000 - 0:19:38.200000::We come on this podcast where like how's your week and everything you're like damn this like director was just being like such
0:19:38.680000 - 0:19:43.160000::So mean to me. It was telling me how disrespectful I was to ever all the crew in the set
0:19:43.560000 - 0:19:47.880000::But and I'm like what the fuck like this is your this is what you need to know get it
0:19:47.880000 - 0:19:49.880000::Do you want the Raheel performance?
0:19:50.360000 - 0:19:55.320000::Right. I'm sorry. Do you well then this is the price that you have to pay is that he's gonna be like
0:19:55.720000 - 0:19:59.960000::Shaking the equipment around and you know like there's gonna be some rentals that get

0:20:00 - 0:20:01.600000::fucked up, you know, there's going to be some
0:20:01.600000 - 0:20:02.560000::gapers. Yeah. Yeah.
0:20:02.880000 - 0:20:06.240000::So like, uh, you know, traumatized, right, you know,
0:20:06.240000 - 0:20:09.300000::right. So 22 year old PAs are going to end up with
0:20:09.300000 - 0:20:11.200000::frappuccino over their heads because they got the wrong
0:20:11.200000 - 0:20:11.440000::flavor.
0:20:13.200000 - 0:20:16.680000::It just, I mean, like, it's a tradeoff. And it's like, what do
0:20:16.680000 - 0:20:20.440000::you want some fucking dumb ass fucking actor who's just off
0:20:20.440000 - 0:20:22.920000::a Craigslist off, you know, like, no, you don't.
0:20:22.920000 - 0:20:25.800000::No, you don't. And what you need is, by the way, because
0:20:25.800000 - 0:20:29.520000::these directors don't know how to handle actors as amazing as
0:20:29.600000 - 0:20:33.560000::our calibers. And the problem is not the actor who's
0:20:33.560000 - 0:20:36.480000::behaving that way. It's think about it like actors are
0:20:36.480000 - 0:20:40::cooking a food. They're a fire, right? And these
0:20:40 - 0:20:43.720000::directors, they don't have the oven technology to contain it
0:20:43.720000 - 0:20:47.320000::because you can't cook food without that fire that and that
0:20:47.320000 - 0:20:50.680000::fire has the power and capacity to destroy your home, to
0:20:50.680000 - 0:20:53.840000::ruin your life, to change your face, melt your eyeballs out
0:20:53.840000 - 0:20:57.480000::and put you in a weird documentary. But if you can be the
0:20:57.480000 - 0:21:00.720000::oven, if you can contain that, if you can be prepared for
0:21:00.720000 - 0:21:04.280000::it, so that you could turn it up to 500, 700 degrees all day
0:21:04.280000 - 0:21:08.360000::long and let it slow roast. That's how you're going to, you
0:21:08.360000 - 0:21:13.560000::know, be able to get that final product. That's worth
0:21:13.560000 - 0:21:18.240000::whatever injuries, casualties, electric electric
0:21:18.280000 - 0:21:23.040000::right, events, right, happen, right? That's this like, well,
0:21:23.080000 - 0:21:26.920000::what they say is the most respectful, easygoing, fun sets to
0:21:26.920000 - 0:21:31.760000::work on are actually the most boring, most mediocre, milk toast
0:21:32.800000 - 0:21:33.480000::uh, uh, uh,
0:21:33.480000 - 0:21:36.600000::blueberries and products. Yeah. Okay. But then you look at
0:21:36.600000 - 0:21:39.920000::something like one of the best films all time Titanic. And
0:21:39.920000 - 0:21:44.160000::that's I saw on 3D, by the way. Congrats. They did it
0:21:44.160000 - 0:21:47.280000::like that to the Titanic. They did the Titanic re-released in
0:21:47.280000 - 0:21:49.840000::3D, especially people who were in North Carolina at the
0:21:49.840000 - 0:21:55.200000::time. What the hell? Yeah. That movie, I remember them, I do
0:21:55.200000 - 0:21:59.120000::remember this, I met our family, friends house, all the older
0:21:59.160000 - 0:22:04.200000::girls are watching Titanic on the on the TV, um, whatever,
0:22:04.200000 - 0:22:08.520000::six years old, seven years old. My mom says, turn around, Eric,
0:22:09.320000 - 0:22:13.080000::I'm like, why would I need to turn around? She's just do it now.
0:22:13.280000 - 0:22:18::She's max, max me. Uh, no, I don't know why I said that she
0:22:18 - 0:22:22::didn't do that. But, um, but I turn around and I don't know
0:22:22 - 0:22:25.480000::what's happening. But there's a mirror pointing at the TV.
0:22:25.480000 - 0:22:29.720000::And what do I see? I see Kate Winslet being all nakedly painted
0:22:30.200000 - 0:22:34.600000::by Leo Naruto de Caprio. Wait a minute. See Daisy.
0:22:34.600000 - 0:22:39.400000::Your mom is she said, don't look at the TV. She says, look,
0:22:40.080000 - 0:22:43::no, no, no, she should turn around. Don't, don't look.
0:22:43.040000 - 0:22:46.040000::I thought your mom, I literally thought you were saying that your
0:22:46.040000 - 0:22:49.080000::mom was standing like you weren't watching the movie and she
0:22:49.080000 - 0:22:51.560000::was standing holding a mirror on the other side of the room.
0:22:54.080000 - 0:22:56.680000::Like forcing me to see this to grow up immediately.
0:22:58.200000 - 0:23:00.840000::But I, but I'm not that was an excellent moment.
0:23:01.880000 - 0:23:04.280000::Yeah, to like pretty, pretty, pretty cool.
0:23:04.320000 - 0:23:07.160000::You got to see that. That's amazing. That's a
0:23:07.160000 - 0:23:10.960000::James Cameron. Shout out to James. He knew what he was doing.
0:23:10.960000 - 0:23:12.960000::He knew what he was doing. He knew what he was doing.
0:23:13.960000 - 0:23:16.920000::Well, what do you guys and just just to say this Titanic, I heard
0:23:16.920000 - 0:23:18.960000::was one of the worst most violent sets on the planet.
0:23:19 - 0:23:22.040000::Sure. People were actually being frozen to death up in that
0:23:22.040000 - 0:23:25.280000::water. Yeah. Yeah. And what you have.
0:23:25.280000 - 0:23:28.880000::So I'll type of gun violence on that set. Well, but look at what
0:23:28.880000 - 0:23:33.360000::happened. It became an amazing feature. Legendary, some would say,
0:23:33.480000 - 0:23:37.840000::solidify James Cameron's career. The worst environments create
0:23:37.840000 - 0:23:44.480000::the best art. Hard times. It's just, I mean, it's just a fact.
0:23:44.480000 - 0:23:48.640000::And I just justify the means. I feel like I'm saying I feel like
0:23:49.640000 - 0:23:53.560000::Eric, you're kind of like the reverse Stanley Kubrick, where you are,
0:23:54 - 0:23:56.720000::you know how you hear about the shining and Shelley DeVal.
0:23:56.720000 - 0:24:00.400000::He was like, again, like we need to do it. Fucking 70 takes drove her and
0:24:00.400000 - 0:24:03.400000::saying, I feel like you're that on the actor side where you're like,
0:24:03.760000 - 0:24:07.040000::you're trying to do like you're yelling at the director and you're like,
0:24:07.400000 - 0:24:10.440000::let's do a fucking other one, man. Like I got more gas in the
0:24:10.440000 - 0:24:15.760000::man. Hey, man, the camera person like came and hold the fucking rig up
0:24:15.760000 - 0:24:20.040000::anymore. Like, like, they're like just trying to keep all their body
0:24:20.040000 - 0:24:22.320000::just lying on the ground permanently ruining their body.
0:24:22.320000 - 0:24:25.080000::You're standing there on the ground. Collapse passed out. Eric, you're just
0:24:25.080000 - 0:24:27.680000::standing over the camera. Get I don't even give a shit with the
0:24:27.680000 - 0:24:32.120000::angle is just let me look into it. Yeah, I'll do whatever it fucking
0:24:32.120000 - 0:24:35.840000::takes to get the shot though. So many actors these days are so weak
0:24:35.920000 - 0:24:38.440000::and they pay for these classes where, oh, here are the maze you've
0:24:38.440000 - 0:24:42.760000::got such a talent. Psych. I don't care if you're talented. I want to see
0:24:42.760000 - 0:24:46.680000::you suffer acting is humiliating. Yeah, you need to suffer on
0:24:46.680000 - 0:24:50.400000::screen and you should be walking away feeling horrible about what you
0:24:50.400000 - 0:24:54.160000::did. You should be walking away with. Yep, because you did. Yeah, tears
0:24:54.160000 - 0:24:56.920000::coming out of your eyes. That's what people want to and your life
0:24:56.920000 - 0:24:59.840000::outside of acting should be a fucking hell.

0:25:00 - 0:25:03.880000::If she's a nightmare, it should be a nightmare because when you do for
0:25:03.880000 - 0:25:05.400000::every production, you're in.
0:25:05.560000 - 0:25:10.040000::If you don't, if you don't have at least one surgery, non-elective for
0:25:10.040000 - 0:25:13.640000::every production that you've been in, you're wasting every one's time.
0:25:13.800000 - 0:25:14.440000::You're joking.
0:25:14.440000 - 0:25:17.400000::No, an essential, well, you can have non-essential if you'd like.
0:25:18.440000 - 0:25:19.120000::I would.
0:25:19.840000 - 0:25:23.440000::What I want to start doing is just doing exploratory surgery before every
0:25:23.440000 - 0:25:24.120000::single film.
0:25:24.120000 - 0:25:26.120000::So they get all up inside all my already.
0:25:26.120000 - 0:25:27.120000::Even though I'm about to know.
0:25:27.120000 - 0:25:34.320000::I feel sort of like broken down and sort of horrible before I start filming
0:25:34.320000 - 0:25:38.440000::because I always put in a vulnerable position because when people are in,
0:25:39.480000 - 0:25:41.200000::I just saw, you know what, this happened.
0:25:41.200000 - 0:25:43.240000::I watched the movie Air Jordan.
0:25:43.360000 - 0:25:43.800000::What's it called?
0:25:43.800000 - 0:25:44.800000::It's just called air.
0:25:44.800000 - 0:25:45.640000::It's just air.
0:25:46.040000 - 0:25:46.760000::It's called air.
0:25:47.080000 - 0:25:49.080000::I watched that last night, but it's about the air.
0:25:49.080000 - 0:25:50.240000::It's about the air, Jordan.
0:25:50.240000 - 0:25:52.440000::What is that funny that you said air Jordan?
0:25:52.560000 - 0:25:53.040000::I don't know.
0:25:53.240000 - 0:25:54::It's not funny.
0:25:54.760000 - 0:25:56.280000::I mean, it is not.
0:25:56.800000 - 0:25:57.400000::It's not.
0:25:57.760000 - 0:26:02.200000::So there's this moment speaking of like inserting injuries into your
0:26:02.200000 - 0:26:06.120000::performance and human, whatever is there just walking this is seen where two
0:26:06.120000 - 0:26:09.280000::people are walking down, talking to each other through a bunch of cubicles in the
0:26:09.280000 - 0:26:11.880000::office, beautiful office and whatever 70s.
0:26:12.320000 - 0:26:16.480000::And one of the characters, bonk, they hit their knee on a thing and they go,
0:26:16.480000 - 0:26:18.960000::ow, and it was like, this didn't need to happen.
0:26:18.960000 - 0:26:25.040000::But having that character for no reason hit their knee on a desk and in the
0:26:25.040000 - 0:26:28.440000::middle of a conversation and you could kind of tell like, oh, that's going to,
0:26:28.560000 - 0:26:31.120000::that's probably like slightly in the back of their head the whole time.
0:26:33.160000 - 0:26:34.080000::Very interesting.
0:26:34.640000 - 0:26:36.040000::Give it up for the director.
0:26:37.240000 - 0:26:41.400000::An athlete, Ben Affleck, who was also in that movie who made a lot of very
0:26:41.400000 - 0:26:43.800000::funny choices with his hair.
0:26:43.800000 - 0:26:44.720000::It's a good movie.
0:26:44.840000 - 0:26:46.560000::What's the, what's the, what's the score?
0:26:46.560000 - 0:26:47.760000::They've Jack Benziga score.
0:26:48.480000 - 0:26:49.560000::It's a great movie.
0:26:49.560000 - 0:26:50.840000::I give it a 10 out of 10.
0:26:51.200000 - 0:26:53.840000::No, it's really always snap.
0:26:54.120000 - 0:27:00.400000::No, it's probably too high, but it was a classic American movie where two,
0:27:01.040000 - 0:27:06.560000::kind of of the greatest old white men we got are telling a business story.
0:27:07.120000 - 0:27:08.280000::And it's not too serious.
0:27:08.280000 - 0:27:12.480000::I feel like if you remember the movie spotlight, they were like being all
0:27:12.480000 - 0:27:14.840000::serious because it was about something all serious and whatnot.
0:27:15.280000 - 0:27:18.240000::But in this one, they're kind of making fun of how stupid everybody is,
0:27:18.240000 - 0:27:19.880000::except for the Jordan family.
0:27:20.480000 - 0:27:23.720000::And I think they did an okay job, except for one thing I got to say,
0:27:23.720000 - 0:27:26.640000::I'm not going to say what the movie theater is, but I didn't fit in the chair.
0:27:26.680000 - 0:27:27.320000::What the hell?
0:27:27.560000 - 0:27:28.520000::It was so hot.
0:27:28.880000 - 0:27:31.600000::This movie theater was, you didn't fit in the chair.
0:27:31.600000 - 0:27:32.840000::What I didn't fit in the chair.
0:27:32.840000 - 0:27:33.520000::It was hot.
0:27:34 - 0:27:36.240000::I'm with the seats read by chance.
0:27:36.360000 - 0:27:37.440000::I couldn't even see him.
0:27:38.080000 - 0:27:41.600000::I was too busy sitting on him to even catch what color they were.
0:27:42.480000 - 0:27:45.960000::How is this name start with an A and end with a C?
0:27:46.280000 - 0:27:48.480000::It, I know it starts with an A, but I can't.
0:27:48.520000 - 0:27:49.400000::Oh, no, it's not AM.
0:27:49.400000 - 0:27:50.400000::And Zell.
0:27:51.720000 - 0:27:53.040000::Oh, Eric, don't do.
0:27:53.040000 - 0:27:54.960000::Oh, don't do that.
0:27:54.960000 - 0:27:56.160000::You want New York?
0:27:56.360000 - 0:28:03.080000::Well, we're little I just had a most amazing experience at maybe it was a different theater number at the Angelica.
0:28:03.080000 - 0:28:03.960000::And I thought it was great.
0:28:03.960000 - 0:28:05.640000::So well, I'm abnormally sized.
0:28:06.880000 - 0:28:07.320000::Not me.
0:28:07.320000 - 0:28:09.960000::I'm the most perfectly normal bodyweight.
0:28:10.200000 - 0:28:10.680000::Right.
0:28:10.680000 - 0:28:11.880000::A lot of products are good.
0:28:12.360000 - 0:28:14.960000::Sometimes I look at you in a chair at a restaurant.
0:28:14.960000 - 0:28:18.120000::I'm like, did they move his ass and back before we got here?
0:28:18.120000 - 0:28:18.640000::Right.
0:28:18.680000 - 0:28:22.840000::And when you put a fork in your mouth, I'm like, did they take a mold of your mouth and see how deep it was?
0:28:23.440000 - 0:28:29.800000::Or talk about talk about dream bodies for a second and Matt Damon, who was in air.
0:28:30.120000 - 0:28:30.320000::Yeah.
0:28:30.320000 - 0:28:38.680000::There is member that movie that talented Mr Ripley, which was a book, initially written by, I think,
0:28:38.680000 - 0:28:40.440000::my name is Patricia Heismeth.
0:28:40.880000 - 0:28:41.120000::Okay.
0:28:41.120000 - 0:28:44.200000::And I read that book in school that wires movie.
0:28:44.720000 - 0:28:49.200000::Press Jude Law, Matt Damon, Matt Damon plays like a psychopath that's like,
0:28:50.160000 - 0:28:59.760000::slowly becomes a psychopath and is like imitating this other guy and living his life as like a rich person in Italy,
0:28:59.760000 - 0:29:00.840000::like an ex-pat.
0:29:01.120000 - 0:29:05.960000::But Matt Damon in that movie is, he's probably 26, whatever he's so svelte.
0:29:06.400000 - 0:29:07::You know what I mean?
0:29:07 - 0:29:09.880000::He looks like he looks kind of perfect.
0:29:10.120000 - 0:29:12.600000::And I don't think I'll ever be able to get that body ever.
0:29:13.440000 - 0:29:14.240000::I don't say that.
0:29:14.600000 - 0:29:15.440000::No, I can't.
0:29:15.600000 - 0:29:17.880000::I don't think it's, I think I've reached up to old.
0:29:18.280000 - 0:29:22.440000::I'm looking more like Ben Affleck in that movie, the way back.
0:29:23.200000 - 0:29:26.680000::Remember this movie with Ben Affleck, where he plays a rapper.
0:29:28.080000 - 0:29:31.680000::Now he plays a overweight basketball coach.
0:29:32.280000 - 0:29:34.880000::They love basketball getting a second, getting a second shot.
0:29:35.080000 - 0:29:36.720000::Oh, dude, I watched the basketball game.
0:29:38.040000 - 0:29:40.040000::You went to one, no on TV.
0:29:40.440000 - 0:29:41.680000::Oh, oh, nice.
0:29:42.280000 - 0:29:42.680000::Thanks man.
0:29:42.680000 - 0:29:43.280000::Congrats.
0:29:43.720000 - 0:29:44.600000::Basketball is fun.
0:29:44.600000 - 0:29:45.960000::It's a fun sport to watch, you know.
0:29:45.960000 - 0:29:48.320000::I saw you watching out on the close friends either day at the time.
0:29:48.320000 - 0:29:51.840000::I thought, what the hell, Jack, you're in, you like that shit, nah?
0:29:52.400000 - 0:29:56::I was just expressing myself to my close friends that I'm having a good night.
0:29:56.200000 - 0:29:59.640000::I'm watching a basketball game, the Celtics versus

0:30:00 - 0:30:02::Atlanta
0:30:02.100000 - 0:30:04.100000::Wait what close friends
0:30:07 - 0:30:09.720000::I'm on Instagram all the time
0:30:12.900000 - 0:30:18.240000::Do you hear my feelings get weirdly hurt when I see that someone else I see like Jackson's to gamine
0:30:18.240000 - 0:30:21.700000::I see some as a close friends and I know for a fact I've never seen that green circle
0:30:21.700000 - 0:30:25.260000::You have a close friends you like what the hell

0:30:38.660000 - 0:30:45.860000::You are doing something wrong with your life if I am all your close friends if you have my phone number you are not doing well
0:30:47.940000 - 0:30:49.260000::Right
0:30:49.260000 - 0:30:53.060000::Okay, here's a question. Here's a fucking question. I love questions
0:30:53.420000 - 0:30:57.580000::In my opinion movies are back indie film is back indie rock is back
0:30:57.580000 - 0:31:04.340000::Sure films are skyrocketing and banana, but that's where people are age and there's people in our very kind of
0:31:04.900000 - 0:31:06.100000::niche communities
0:31:06.100000 - 0:31:09.500000::How do we get movies to become popular again?
0:31:10.260000 - 0:31:12.260000::Amongst the youth
0:31:12.260000 - 0:31:15.900000::Wow, because you know they ain't watching that shit. They got there. I'll tick-tocked out
0:31:15.900000 - 0:31:21.140000::They got about a 30 second intentions band there. You think they're gonna watch the four hour scores. Azy move
0:31:21.140000 - 0:31:25.620000::It coming out you know it's gonna be four hours the killers of the flower moon. Oh my goodness. What's funny?
0:31:25.620000 - 0:31:28.620000::Yeah, I was four hours. That's a
0:31:29.380000 - 0:31:35.060000::Year and a half to the tick-tock generation. They really don't have the attendance band that we do
0:31:38.060000 - 0:31:40.580000::But Eric what's funny is I
0:31:41.260000 - 0:31:48.740000::Feel like a lot of people assume these young kids they enjoy you know tick-tock silly little cartoons funny little memes
0:31:48.900000 - 0:31:52.840000::Vine this and that I think it's the opposite because I
0:31:53.840000 - 0:32:00.120000::Talked to some 13-year-olds sometimes walking around Manhattan for real and they are paying attention to politics
0:32:00.300000 - 0:32:06.860000::I'm a mental or these are my cousins and whatnot
0:32:08.060000 - 0:32:12.700000::My cut whatever and so they these people are plugged in
0:32:13.220000 - 0:32:15.860000::To where you know, I'm telling them like oh, I was just
0:32:15.860000 - 0:32:20.660000::interviewin' CalPan or whatever for tuning out the news and they're like, oh my gosh, I can't believe that.
0:32:20.660000 - 0:32:23.300000::That was really interesting. I'm wondering how the primaries are gonna go because
0:32:23.300000 - 0:32:29.300000::Rondus and this is, you know, pulling this way in that way. I really wonder with the wartime Ukraine. I'm thinking,
0:32:30.500000 - 0:32:32.500000::you're 13 and you know who?
0:32:33.540000 - 0:32:34.540000::CalPan is?
0:32:34.540000 - 0:32:35.540000::CalPan is?
0:32:35.540000 - 0:32:38.340000::How's that possible?
0:32:38.340000 - 0:32:40.140000::Harold and Kumar?
0:32:40.300000 - 0:32:43.980000::Harold and Kumar is something that only very smart people know about at this point.
0:32:43.980000 - 0:32:44.860000::Right. Yeah.
0:32:44.860000 - 0:32:47.020000::Both of them went into politics, essentially.
0:32:47.020000 - 0:32:50.220000::Have you guys ever looked at your demographics on Instagram?
0:32:50.860000 - 0:32:53.820000::99% female, 100% non-American.

0:33:07.020000 - 0:33:08.140000::And what is it about you?
0:33:08.140000 - 0:33:11.180000::Almost, it's like 0.1% under 18.
0:33:11.180000 - 0:33:17.420000::Thank God, that's how I designed it. I have mature sort of content that I'm putting out there.
0:33:17.420000 - 0:33:18.220000::Right.

0:33:47.420000 - 0:33:50.620000::I just thought of this, do you think I should have the bald, like,
0:33:51.500000 - 0:33:53.740000::you know how like Jay-Z has that like,
0:33:53.740000 - 0:33:56.220000::that rock nation brunch or whatever?
0:33:56.220000 - 0:33:59.340000::And it's like, it's like everyone comes and they're like,
0:33:59.340000 - 0:34:03.100000::powerful people like congregate at this brunch like once a year.
0:34:03.100000 - 0:34:05.260000::I want to do that for like, bald men.
0:34:05.260000 - 0:34:08.780000::And like, we all like get together at like one kind of like,
0:34:08.780000 - 0:34:11.020000::mansion or function or dinner.
0:34:11.020000 - 0:34:14.380000::And we, and it's just like a bunch of bald men just like, swagged out.
0:34:14.380000 - 0:34:18.860000::And like the craziest type of suits outfits, there's like red carpet.
0:34:18.860000 - 0:34:21.500000::There's like crazy like drinks going on.
0:34:21.500000 - 0:34:23.580000::And we're just like kind of exchanging like,
0:34:24.780000 - 0:34:28.460000::what we know with one another and uniting has one kind of.
0:34:28.620000 - 0:34:31.420000::You need some kind of blood, some not blood ritual,
0:34:31.420000 - 0:34:32.860000::but just regular ass ritual.
0:34:32.860000 - 0:34:34.620000::Human sacrifice type of shit.
0:34:34.620000 - 0:34:37.020000::Some thing to bind you guys.
0:34:37.020000 - 0:34:37.580000::Hair.
0:34:37.580000 - 0:34:39.500000::If you all kind of scratched your head a little bit,
0:34:39.500000 - 0:34:41.420000::get a little blood into everybody has blood.
0:34:41.420000 - 0:34:42.700000::Oh, yeah.
0:34:42.700000 - 0:34:43.980000::It could be a hair related.
0:34:43.980000 - 0:34:46.300000::Well, it could be like, okay, for one night only,
0:34:46.300000 - 0:34:49.100000::we're going to get all the bald people in the world in one room.
0:34:49.100000 - 0:34:52.460000::And we're going to put everybody in wigs and no one's going to know
0:34:53.020000 - 0:34:57.820000::what our true power is when we have this fucking poppy of shit going on.
0:34:57.820000 - 0:34:59.980000::And you're just going to go in there and lift weights and

0:35:00 - 0:35:01.840000::I hook up and listen that.
0:35:01.840000 - 0:35:02.680000::I hook up.
0:35:02.680000 - 0:35:04.080000::Is it my question?
0:35:04.080000 - 0:35:05.120000::Is it top secret?
0:35:05.120000 - 0:35:06.320000::Or are you going to sell tickets?
0:35:06.320000 - 0:35:09.360000::Because I'd love to watch it.
0:35:09.360000 - 0:35:11.160000::No, it'll be kind of like medieval times.
0:35:11.160000 - 0:35:12::You know what I'm saying?
0:35:12 - 0:35:14.480000::Oh, it's like a thing you can buy tickets.
0:35:14.480000 - 0:35:16.880000::Yeah, yeah, you'll have like a dinner and like, you know,
0:35:16.880000 - 0:35:18.160000::I'm like an arena.
0:35:18.160000 - 0:35:20.160000::So the bald men are all in a pen.
0:35:20.160000 - 0:35:22.400000::And then a bunch of hair people can come buy tickets
0:35:22.400000 - 0:35:23.400000::and eat chicken and all.
0:35:23.400000 - 0:35:24.720000::Did you call them hair?
0:35:24.720000 - 0:35:25.560000::Yeah.
0:35:25.560000 - 0:35:26.400000::Haird.
0:35:26.400000 - 0:35:27.400000::Haird.
0:35:27.400000 - 0:35:28.720000::Haird.
0:35:28.720000 - 0:35:31.280000::But once we unite, it's over.
0:35:31.280000 - 0:35:33.240000::It is over.
0:35:33.240000 - 0:35:33.760000::Yeah.
0:35:33.760000 - 0:35:35.640000::We have been separate for too long.
0:35:35.640000 - 0:35:38.800000::All of the bald men in America, they want us to be,
0:35:38.800000 - 0:35:40.120000::they want to divide us.
0:35:40.120000 - 0:35:42.920000::Because that's what they do to the most powerful groups is
0:35:42.920000 - 0:35:45.040000::because when we're talking to one another,
0:35:45.040000 - 0:35:48.720000::that's when the elite, the haired folks, that's when they win.
0:35:48.720000 - 0:35:49.920000::And they want to keep us separate.
0:35:49.920000 - 0:35:52.920000::They want to keep the rock and vending zeal separate.
0:35:52.920000 - 0:35:54.160000::They really do.
0:35:54.160000 - 0:35:56.160000::They do because they know once they unite,
0:35:56.160000 - 0:35:58.680000::it's once they run their heads together.
0:35:58.680000 - 0:36:00.360000::Well, let me say this.
0:36:00.360000 - 0:36:01.680000::Then you're going to have people in the mid,
0:36:01.680000 - 0:36:03.920000::there's going to be people like me and Jack who
0:36:03.920000 - 0:36:07::are being basically torn apart by the haired side
0:36:07 - 0:36:10.280000::and the balding side where you have to pick a side.
0:36:10.280000 - 0:36:12.080000::Yeah, well, we're trying to, man.
0:36:12.080000 - 0:36:16.040000::And it's not much of a nature's taken a certain path.
0:36:16.040000 - 0:36:18.880000::It's receding whatever.
0:36:18.880000 - 0:36:20.720000::But I think it's going to be so powerful.
0:36:20.720000 - 0:36:22.760000::You're going to have such a powerful event here, dude,
0:36:22.760000 - 0:36:25.880000::that me and Jack with our hairlines kind of going back
0:36:25.880000 - 0:36:27.360000::are going to be banging on the doors,
0:36:27.360000 - 0:36:28.960000::banging you to let us in.
0:36:28.960000 - 0:36:29.920000::You guys are going to be like,
0:36:29.920000 - 0:36:31.360000::you like shaved the top of your head.
0:36:31.360000 - 0:36:32.120000::Please.
0:36:32.120000 - 0:36:33.840000::And you guys see that little hairs and it's,
0:36:33.840000 - 0:36:35.760000::no, you still got a little left, dude.
0:36:35.760000 - 0:36:37::Well, Nate, what do you think it is?
0:36:37 - 0:36:41.760000::Why do you think hair makes people weak biologically?
0:36:41.760000 - 0:36:44.160000::I feel like there's got to be a reason that if it's
0:36:44.160000 - 0:36:47.080000::the extra weight on your head that's making you look down
0:36:47.080000 - 0:36:52.200000::or if it's the extra weight.
0:36:52.200000 - 0:36:55.600000::Or if it's the heat, you know, it's not meant for certain
0:36:55.600000 - 0:36:57.560000::climates or if it's thoughts literally,
0:36:57.560000 - 0:37:00.080000::if it's like a fair day cage, like blocking radio waves
0:37:00.080000 - 0:37:03.040000::from coming into your brain, like, why do the government
0:37:03.040000 - 0:37:04.680000::want to hold ball people back so much?
0:37:04.680000 - 0:37:07.360000::Because clearly, if you look at Hollywood, like,
0:37:07.360000 - 0:37:09.880000::it just so happens that everybody pretty much on the planet
0:37:09.880000 - 0:37:11.880000::has hair, except for these like the rock
0:37:11.880000 - 0:37:15.200000::and these literal beasts of burden who they're like, you know,
0:37:15.200000 - 0:37:18.040000::and they're basically intimidating to make it
0:37:18.040000 - 0:37:19.920000::as a bald man in Hollywood.
0:37:19.920000 - 0:37:22.840000::Why do you think I'm lifting weights like crazy?
0:37:22.840000 - 0:37:25.280000::You can do that.
0:37:25.280000 - 0:37:28.240000::You can do that.
0:37:28.240000 - 0:37:30.640000::Attractors certain good demonstrators.
0:37:30.640000 - 0:37:33.480000::Well, well, let's just say what?
0:37:33.480000 - 0:37:36.080000::Let's just say weights are good for you.
0:37:36.080000 - 0:37:39.440000::Yeah, why are weights so delicious to me?
0:37:39.440000 - 0:37:40.360000::I don't know.
0:37:40.360000 - 0:37:41.520000::Edible weights.
0:37:41.520000 - 0:37:42.400000::Edible.
0:37:42.400000 - 0:37:43.200000::Edible weights.
0:37:43.200000 - 0:37:44.040000::You get to eat that.
0:37:44.040000 - 0:37:47.360000::Oh, I would be in Caleb worked out yesterday.
0:37:47.360000 - 0:37:49.440000::Hit it hard, OK?
0:37:49.440000 - 0:37:51.800000::List are going up in a way.
0:37:51.800000 - 0:37:53.280000::By the way, too, I need to say this.
0:37:53.280000 - 0:37:56.680000::My baseline, like, lifts are going up.
0:37:56.680000 - 0:37:58.440000::The weight is going up on all of them.
0:37:58.440000 - 0:38:01.280000::But I've gained about 20-ish pounds
0:38:01.280000 - 0:38:03.400000::since I last was serious about lifting weights.
0:38:03.400000 - 0:38:06.200000::And in my head, I'm like, oh, I kind of body this.
0:38:06.200000 - 0:38:08.800000::Like, for some reason, my strength is so high.
0:38:08.800000 - 0:38:12.880000::Well, it's just because I got that weight put on my body.
0:38:12.880000 - 0:38:14.200000::Well, no, that's muscle.
0:38:14.200000 - 0:38:15.160000::It's probably muscle.
0:38:15.160000 - 0:38:17.240000::No, I don't know.
0:38:17.240000 - 0:38:17.880000::It could be.
0:38:17.880000 - 0:38:18.960000::You don't know.
0:38:18.960000 - 0:38:20.120000::But here's the thing I was going to say.
0:38:20.120000 - 0:38:23.240000::Caleb, when I were working out, what do we see on the bench?
0:38:23.240000 - 0:38:27.960000::It's the most mildewy locker room that's ever existed.
0:38:27.960000 - 0:38:28.800000::It's a little dirty.
0:38:28.800000 - 0:38:29.640000::I love the gym.
0:38:29.640000 - 0:38:30.560000::I love the gym.
0:38:30.560000 - 0:38:31.720000::It's no shade.
0:38:31.720000 - 0:38:34.840000::But this guy is leaning over on one of the benches,
0:38:34.840000 - 0:38:36.400000::opening up a Tupperware.
0:38:36.400000 - 0:38:39.480000::And it's full of cheesy beef patties.
0:38:39.480000 - 0:38:41.760000::Just that they look so congealed and they're cold.
0:38:41.760000 - 0:38:43.080000::And it's hot.
0:38:43.080000 - 0:38:44.080000::What?
0:38:44.080000 - 0:38:45.520000::Wait, what?
0:38:45.520000 - 0:38:47.120000::Why has he got cheesy beef patties?
0:38:47.120000 - 0:38:49.160000::Because he's getting protein in before his lips.
0:38:49.160000 - 0:38:51.200000::Or like right after he lifted.
0:38:51.200000 - 0:38:54.600000::And he shirts off and he's clearly empty or just like.
0:38:54.600000 - 0:38:55.440000::He's not happy.
0:38:55.440000 - 0:38:57.400000::But what's that?
0:38:57.400000 - 0:38:58.240000::No, no patties.
0:38:58.240000 - 0:38:59.440000::There's no carbs, dude.
0:38:59.440000 - 0:39:02.240000::Do you think he'd sell him?
0:39:02.240000 - 0:39:03::I didn't ask.
0:39:03 - 0:39:04.720000::I felt revolting.
0:39:04.720000 - 0:39:06.640000::Man, that's fucked up to here.
0:39:06.640000 - 0:39:10.120000::But you got to respect it, too, because why?
0:39:10.120000 - 0:39:12.040000::You know, just eat where you got to.
0:39:12.040000 - 0:39:13.080000::Eat where you got to.
0:39:13.080000 - 0:39:14.400000::Listen to your body.
0:39:14.400000 - 0:39:15.840000::I was at the gym recently.
0:39:15.840000 - 0:39:18.200000::And I'm in a similar situation where
0:39:18.760000 - 0:39:22.880000::the locker room is like borderline disgusting at my gym.
0:39:22.880000 - 0:39:23.720000::At the Y?
0:39:23.720000 - 0:39:24.560000::At the YMCA.
0:39:24.560000 - 0:39:26.080000::OK, yeah, let's put them on blast area.
0:39:26.080000 - 0:39:27.240000::At the YMCA, Glendale.
0:39:27.240000 - 0:39:29.440000::Where's the hell of that one?
0:39:29.440000 - 0:39:33.160000::Yeah, come check me out if you know there, actually,
0:39:33.160000 - 0:39:34.200000::at these times.
0:39:34.200000 - 0:39:37.280000::But the locker room there is fucking atrocious.
0:39:37.280000 - 0:39:37.800000::All right.
0:39:37.800000 - 0:39:39::And they need to hear this, honestly,
0:39:39 - 0:39:41.480000::because they need to fix some shit in there.
0:39:41.480000 - 0:39:47.840000::And there is mysteriously, things get stolen in the locker room.
0:39:47.840000 - 0:39:49.640000::And you can't leave your stuff out.
0:39:49.640000 - 0:39:50.960000::You need to lock it up.
0:39:50.960000 - 0:39:52.800000::It's one of those places, you know?
0:39:52.800000 - 0:39:55.880000::And I put out a body wash, just have it out
0:39:55.880000 - 0:39:57.480000::while I'm in the sauna.
0:39:57.480000 - 0:39:59.880000::And it goes missing, OK?

0:40:00 - 0:40:00.840000::I'm like, what the fuck?
0:40:00.840000 - 0:40:02.440000::This is Dr. Bronner.
0:40:02.440000 - 0:40:03.280000::Dr. Bronner.
0:40:03.280000 - 0:40:04.120000::Yeah.
0:40:04.120000 - 0:40:08.600000::I'm coming in with the fucking pure dye, no dyes in it.
0:40:08.600000 - 0:40:09.440000::Like, you know what I'm saying?
0:40:09.440000 - 0:40:11.760000::I'm coming in with fresh, the good stuff.
0:40:11.760000 - 0:40:13.600000::And somebody fucking took it.
0:40:13.600000 - 0:40:17.840000::And a couple of weeks go by and I see that
0:40:17.840000 - 0:40:21.840000::same exact pure Dr. Bronner's spot on your eyes.
0:40:21.840000 - 0:40:24.280000::That's when you got the gun out, didn't you?
0:40:24.280000 - 0:40:27.640000::You're like, and I look in the shower and there's more.
0:40:27.640000 - 0:40:29.880000::Or is Takashi Six and I.
0:40:29.880000 - 0:40:30.880000::Yeah.

0:42:45.040000 - 0:42:46.920000::Oh, and I want to call this out.
0:42:46.920000 - 0:42:49.200000::I got a DM from two people.
0:42:49.200000 - 0:42:51.600000::And they said that they've been listening to joy tactics
0:42:51.600000 - 0:42:54.960000::and they want to joy-technic shrooms episode.

0:42:55.560000 - 0:42:57.360000::And they're saying that they were talking about us
0:42:57.360000 - 0:42:59.240000::on their shroom trip.
0:42:59.240000 - 0:43:02.960000::And I don't have the heart to tell them, I never done that stuff.
0:43:02.960000 - 0:43:04.840000::Well, let me tell them something.
0:43:04.840000 - 0:43:09::We are going to get Eric in a hotel in Vegas.
0:43:09 - 0:43:12.400000::And we are going to dose this man, whether he likes it or not.
0:43:12.400000 - 0:43:15.040000::And I know you're listening to it right now.
0:43:15.040000 - 0:43:17.800000::We're going to find whatever's after heroic dose.
0:43:17.800000 - 0:43:18.600000::Dose X.
0:43:18.600000 - 0:43:19.440000::You know what I mean?
0:43:19.440000 - 0:43:23::Like you're about to get the experimental dose.
0:43:23 - 0:43:26.640000::And can you imagine with my arms tied with ropes to the bedposts?
0:43:26.640000 - 0:43:27.640000::It's going to be tough.
0:43:27.640000 - 0:43:28.640000::Can't believe it.
0:43:28.640000 - 0:43:29.640000::But we're going to do it.
0:43:29.640000 - 0:43:33.440000::It's putting binaural beats on my head to try to relax me.
0:43:33.440000 - 0:43:35.360000::With dripping water in your arms.
0:43:35.360000 - 0:43:36.560000::Frothing at the mouth.
0:43:36.560000 - 0:43:41.480000::And I know if you're those two people who DM you, you're probably still coming down.
0:43:41.480000 - 0:43:44.200000::You're probably still tripping a little bit because when did they do the mushroom
0:43:44.200000 - 0:43:45.200000::plastic?
0:43:45.200000 - 0:43:46.200000::They did.
0:43:46.200000 - 0:43:47.200000::They did 48 hours?
0:43:47.200000 - 0:43:48.200000::It depends.
0:43:48.200000 - 0:43:49.200000::It depends.
0:43:49.200000 - 0:43:50.200000::You know, that's a fun thing.
0:43:50.200000 - 0:43:54.600000::There really is the before you did the shrooms and the after.
0:43:54.600000 - 0:43:59.040000::And then all the sudden, there's also before you had that, whatever.
0:43:59.040000 - 0:44:01.480000::I want to give you so much for the hummus.
0:44:01.480000 - 0:44:04.240000::I want to give you so much rooms, Eric.

0:44:12.560000 - 0:44:13.560000::I want to give you a shroom.
0:44:13.560000 - 0:44:14.560000::Yeah.
0:44:14.560000 - 0:44:15.560000::I want to give you a shroom.
0:44:15.560000 - 0:44:17.840000::I want to give you hella shrooms.

0:44:31 - 0:44:35.320000::espresso, put you in a straight jacket and then put you on like a roller coaster or something
0:44:35.320000 - 0:44:40.200000::and just like when you get off of this trip, you will have received information that
0:44:40.200000 - 0:44:42.120000::human beings have never received before.
0:44:42.120000 - 0:44:45.440000::It's like that we need to focus.
0:44:45.440000 - 0:44:46.960000::We need you to focus for this, Eric.
0:44:46.960000 - 0:44:52.080000::And remember the questions that we want you to ask, why are we here?

0:44:55.920000 - 0:44:56.920000::How are you?
0:44:56.920000 - 0:44:58.920000::I saw a TikTok.

0:45:13.440000 - 0:45:18.100000::I found the code behind everything. And he starts going through it. He's like, he went
0:45:18.100000 - 0:45:23.600000::into the DMT trip so hard that he went behind a wall in the DMT trip and it was all code.

0:45:30.560000 - 0:45:33.920000::Well, we don't even need that because look at DNA. It's literally code.
0:45:33.920000 - 0:45:35::Like there is code.

0:48:17.200000 - 0:48:18.440000::Our legs are moving so slowly.
0:48:21.760000 - 0:48:22.360000::Right.
0:48:22.600000 - 0:48:27.400000::So, and we look at it and it looks like it's moving fast, right?
0:48:31.840000 - 0:48:33.120000::I really don't have anything for this.
0:48:33.120000 - 0:48:33.560000::I'm trying to.
0:48:33.560000 - 0:48:34.600000::I'm trying to beat you.
0:48:34.600000 - 0:48:36.840000::I just, I think there's a lot there.
0:48:37.400000 - 0:48:38.280000::There's something there.
0:48:38.280000 - 0:48:39.360000::I don't know what it is.
0:48:39.920000 - 0:48:40.840000::I hate that, man.
0:48:40.840000 - 0:48:44.880000::Sometimes I get mad at my brain that it would give me such a fruitful setup for no, no
0:48:44.880000 - 0:48:45.800000::reason whatsoever.
0:48:46 - 0:48:47.720000::How do you guys say that for a reason?
0:48:47.720000 - 0:48:52::Because like, ants are such a good metaphor for zooming out, you know what I'm saying?
0:48:52.040000 - 0:48:57.560000::And it's a good, it's a good metaphor for a perception, you know what I'm saying?
0:48:57.560000 - 0:49:02.040000::Like ants, they have no idea that we have New York City, that we have Las Vegas,
0:49:02.440000 - 0:49:08.240000::that we have all these crazy, yeah, and they're just going about their time.
0:49:08.280000 - 0:49:12.560000::They're, they're, their days, you know, and I feel like that's kind of how we view the alien world,
0:49:13.160000 - 0:49:18.600000::you know, that there might be some crazy alien species that dips in.
0:49:18.600000 - 0:49:24.560000::And once we see a UFO, that's like a leg coming down, you know, and the UFOs are like, what?
0:49:24.560000 - 0:49:25.360000::Oh, shit.
0:49:25.360000 - 0:49:26.880000::We don't even care about these ants.
0:49:26.880000 - 0:49:28.240000::And you know what's funny?
0:49:28.240000 - 0:49:28.720000::People over.
0:49:28.720000 - 0:49:33.920000::If you think about your entire life, that's one giant step.
0:49:34.880000 - 0:49:38.080000::And you know, Jerry Springer to bring it back.
0:49:38.080000 - 0:49:38.800000::Right.
0:49:38.800000 - 0:49:40.960000::He basically just took his first step.
0:49:42.720000 - 0:49:48.480000::You know, that was, that feels like a long time, long swing, but he just took his first step.
0:49:48.480000 - 0:49:50.960000::And as far as we know, his soul just,
0:49:51.920000 - 0:49:54.240000::something just got my throat just like,
0:49:55.360000 - 0:49:56.480000::I'm doing another body.
0:49:56.480000 - 0:49:57.200000::That was the spirit of Jerry.
0:49:57.200000 - 0:49:58.320000::He's going to take another step.
0:49:58.320000 - 0:50:00::Oh my god, Jerry Springer is a great person.

0:50:00 - 0:50:01.360000::It feels like some dust.
0:50:04.040000 - 0:50:07.840000::Gary Springer is probably getting ignorant in heaven right now.
0:50:07.840000 - 0:50:10.080000::Oh, he probably is.
0:50:10.080000 - 0:50:12.080000::Oh my, he's probably getting milked.
0:50:12.080000 - 0:50:12.920000::He's stirring.
0:50:12.920000 - 0:50:16.120000::Oh, he's probably getting the...
0:50:17.920000 - 0:50:20.720000::Do you think he's doing the dirty Springer show in heaven?
0:50:20.720000 - 0:50:22.560000::Oh, I don't know.
0:50:22.560000 - 0:50:23.800000::Or is he doing a different show?
0:50:23.800000 - 0:50:24.320000::With who?
0:50:24.320000 - 0:50:25.640000::Babe Ruth.
0:50:25.640000 - 0:50:27.320000::Babe Ruth?
0:50:27.320000 - 0:50:28.480000::Lou Garreg.
0:50:28.480000 - 0:50:31.720000::Babe Ruth is like the baby daddy to all these angels.
0:50:31.720000 - 0:50:32.720000::Well, this is funny.
0:50:32.720000 - 0:50:34::Hey, you know what?
0:50:35.080000 - 0:50:36.240000::Guess what?
0:50:36.240000 - 0:50:40.400000::Jerry Springer now knows who the father is.
0:50:40.400000 - 0:50:41.560000::You know what I'm saying?
0:50:41.560000 - 0:50:43.640000::Oh, yo.
0:50:43.640000 - 0:50:45.800000::He has met the father.
0:50:45.800000 - 0:50:46.960000::We did.
0:50:46.960000 - 0:50:47.800000::We did.
0:50:47.800000 - 0:50:49.960000::That is the legendary.
0:50:49.960000 - 0:50:52.400000::Dear God, we are the father.
0:50:52.400000 - 0:50:53.800000::Yeah.
0:50:53.800000 - 0:50:55.360000::A little way too late.
0:50:55.360000 - 0:50:56.920000::I bet God tried to save us.
0:50:56.920000 - 0:50:57.760000::I bet.
0:50:57.760000 - 0:51:00.320000::Dude, I bet God said that shit right when Jerry got there
0:51:00.320000 - 0:51:02.640000::and Jerry was like, ha ha ha.
0:51:02.640000 - 0:51:03.480000::Like, yeah.
0:51:03.480000 - 0:51:04.480000::Let me see all my friends.
0:51:04.480000 - 0:51:06.840000::Yeah, I miss my parents.
0:51:06.840000 - 0:51:08.480000::Yeah, I miss my parents.
0:51:08.480000 - 0:51:10.080000::I miss my parents badly.
0:51:10.080000 - 0:51:11.040000::I miss inventors.
0:51:11.040000 - 0:51:11.880000::I want to meet my dad.
0:51:11.880000 - 0:51:12.640000::Let's see Daisy.
0:51:12.640000 - 0:51:15.400000::My dog just entered the room.
0:51:15.400000 - 0:51:17.080000::Give it up for Eric's dog bubbles.
0:51:17.080000 - 0:51:17.920000::Bubbles.
0:51:17.920000 - 0:51:18.680000::Bubbles, the producer.
0:51:18.680000 - 0:51:20.200000::Yeah, bubble is the producer.
0:51:20.200000 - 0:51:23.880000::She's kind of saying, I think she wants to play badly.
0:51:25.280000 - 0:51:27::You've been electing her.
0:51:27 - 0:51:28.120000::Yeah, I haven't.
0:51:28.120000 - 0:51:29.960000::To ground a crazy white this morning.
0:51:29.960000 - 0:51:35.120000::You see, you are not picked up to be a pet owner.
0:51:35.120000 - 0:51:36.320000::You are.
0:51:36.320000 - 0:51:38.440000::So you can barely take care of yourself.
0:51:38.440000 - 0:51:40::No, not true anymore.
0:51:40 - 0:51:42.320000::And now you have another living creature.
0:51:42.320000 - 0:51:43.440000::Do it anymore.
0:51:43.440000 - 0:51:44.280000::Yeah.
0:51:48.920000 - 0:51:50.200000::Now, Eric's a great father.
0:51:50.200000 - 0:51:51.680000::Any one of our listeners would be
0:51:51.680000 - 0:51:54.160000::lucky to be owned by Eric as a pet.
0:51:54.160000 - 0:51:55.240000::I would too.
0:51:55.240000 - 0:51:56.080000::Yeah.
0:51:56.080000 - 0:51:57.760000::I'd like to give him Hello Organic stuff.
0:51:57.760000 - 0:52:00.680000::I feel like if anything, Nate, the opposite is true.
0:52:00.680000 - 0:52:04.920000::You and I have zero business ever being responsible for life.
0:52:04.920000 - 0:52:06.160000::Oh, absolutely.
0:52:06.160000 - 0:52:07.160000::Yeah.
0:52:07.160000 - 0:52:08::Good God.
0:52:08 - 0:52:09.920000::If you ever see my ass with a fucking child,
0:52:09.920000 - 0:52:11.600000::take that child away.
0:52:11.600000 - 0:52:12.760000::I will not.
0:52:12.760000 - 0:52:13.600000::I will not.
0:52:13.600000 - 0:52:15.200000::This is all detective services.
0:52:15.200000 - 0:52:17.400000::Take that child and keep it.
0:52:17.400000 - 0:52:20.240000::Because I think this is going to be played
0:52:20.240000 - 0:52:21.800000::at your first custody trial.
0:52:21.800000 - 0:52:23.040000::And it's going to lose you.
0:52:23.040000 - 0:52:24.240000::Get out or do it.
0:52:26.680000 - 0:52:28.320000::Oh, my God.
0:52:28.320000 - 0:52:29.640000::Oh, shit.
0:52:29.640000 - 0:52:31.040000::Well, then let me try this one.
0:52:31.040000 - 0:52:33.080000::OK, this is for Gucci glasses on.
0:52:33.080000 - 0:52:34.080000::Oh, my God.
0:52:36.960000 - 0:52:41.320000::Damn, that makes me want to do a video to be used like in court.
0:52:41.320000 - 0:52:44.320000::Like, hey, what's the, like, man, Nate, Eric,
0:52:44.320000 - 0:52:47::I just wanted to randomly express to you guys how sane I am,
0:52:47 - 0:52:47.840000::how capable I am.
0:52:47.840000 - 0:52:48.360000::Yeah, yeah.
0:52:48.360000 - 0:52:48.840000::Not to blame.
0:52:48.840000 - 0:52:49.680000::Oh, that's good.
0:52:49.680000 - 0:52:50.520000::I should cover our asses.
0:52:50.520000 - 0:52:52.960000::I love everybody, everyone in my family.
0:52:52.960000 - 0:52:53.960000::I would never hurt anyone.
0:52:53.960000 - 0:52:55.520000::I would never steal a vehicle.
0:52:55.520000 - 0:52:57.560000::I would never put any.
0:52:57.560000 - 0:52:58.080000::Right.
0:52:58.080000 - 0:53:01.280000::Jack, I just wanted to say this that I feel like you would,
0:53:01.280000 - 0:53:03.040000::you're one of my friends that I'm like, well,
0:53:03.040000 - 0:53:05.200000::how could this person ever murder somebody?
0:53:05.200000 - 0:53:06.480000::He's such an awesome person.
0:53:06.480000 - 0:53:07.640000::He would never murder somebody.
0:53:07.640000 - 0:53:08.720000::And I'm always busy.
0:53:08.720000 - 0:53:09.880000::I'm always busy.
0:53:09.880000 - 0:53:11::You're always doing stuff.
0:53:11 - 0:53:13.680000::And whenever there's a murder, it's like, I would have been there,
0:53:13.680000 - 0:53:14.720000::but I wasn't.
0:53:14.720000 - 0:53:15.440000::Right, right.
0:53:15.440000 - 0:53:17.560000::Like, you have no time to even murder anybody.
0:53:17.560000 - 0:53:18.600000::You're so busy.
0:53:18.600000 - 0:53:19.120000::Right.
0:53:19.120000 - 0:53:20.840000::And Eric, you don't even allow yourself
0:53:20.840000 - 0:53:23.240000::to be around people under 21.
0:53:23.240000 - 0:53:24.800000::No, no, I don't.
0:53:24.800000 - 0:53:26.720000::No, not at all.
0:53:26.720000 - 0:53:27.560000::Not even for me.
0:53:27.560000 - 0:53:30.240000::I had a video on a video on a make really quick.
0:53:30.240000 - 0:53:31.080000::OK.
0:53:31.080000 - 0:53:32.880000::OK, watch this.
0:53:32.880000 - 0:53:34.320000::I like fire.
0:53:34.320000 - 0:53:35.560000::Oh.
0:53:35.560000 - 0:53:39.160000::I like burning things and seeing the red flames.
0:53:45.160000 - 0:53:46.160000::That's a little more.
0:53:46.160000 - 0:53:48.160000::I'm so, so bad.
0:53:48.160000 - 0:53:51.560000::I'm trying to do it for the arson, if I ever get cover arson.
0:53:51.560000 - 0:53:54::Well, don't joke about arson, because you know how it happens.
0:53:54 - 0:53:55::Yeah.
0:53:55 - 0:53:56::I know the game.
0:53:56 - 0:53:57::Why my ears red?
0:53:57 - 0:54:00.400000::Like, why did I just didn't feel too good?
0:54:00.400000 - 0:54:02.440000::I'm thinking about this podcast.
0:54:02.440000 - 0:54:04::We try things and we fail.
0:54:04 - 0:54:05.720000::And guess what failure is?
0:54:05.720000 - 0:54:06.720000::Attack the building.
0:54:06.720000 - 0:54:07.720000::The building blocks.
0:54:07.720000 - 0:54:08.720000::The foundation.
0:54:08.720000 - 0:54:10.040000::There's no such thing as failures.
0:54:10.040000 - 0:54:11.240000::There's only lessons.
0:54:11.240000 - 0:54:12.240000::That's correct.
0:54:12.240000 - 0:54:13.720000::So what gave my ass?
0:54:13.720000 - 0:54:14.840000::Oh, sorry, Jack.
0:54:14.840000 - 0:54:16.080000::No, I actually didn't have anything.
0:54:16.080000 - 0:54:17.360000::Go ahead.
0:54:17.360000 - 0:54:19.720000::Well, I wanted to ask myself what gave me joy this week.
0:54:19.720000 - 0:54:20.960000::And I have a quick ass answer.
0:54:20.960000 - 0:54:22.120000::Do you want to know what it is?
0:54:22.120000 - 0:54:23.120000::Please.
0:54:23.760000 - 0:54:26.200000::It's my new favorite easy meal.
0:54:26.200000 - 0:54:27.040000::OK?
0:54:27.040000 - 0:54:28.200000::It's all the listeners.
0:54:28.200000 - 0:54:29.960000::And to you guys, I would say try this.
0:54:29.960000 - 0:54:33.240000::We just got a rice cooker.
0:54:33.240000 - 0:54:34.240000::OK?
0:54:34.240000 - 0:54:36.240000::And it's not the same as an instant pot.
0:54:36.240000 - 0:54:37.440000::This is a real deal thing.
0:54:37.440000 - 0:54:40.640000::And it makes sweet little noises, little jingles for you
0:54:40.640000 - 0:54:43.360000::when the rice is cooking and when it's done.
0:54:43.360000 - 0:54:45.440000::And we have all this rice now.
0:54:45.440000 - 0:54:47.320000::And here's the thing.
0:54:47.320000 - 0:54:49.560000::You can have a pantry meal in seconds.
0:54:49.560000 - 0:54:50.720000::You cook the rice.
0:54:50.720000 - 0:54:51.360000::You have it.
0:54:51.360000 - 0:54:53::You store it in the fridge.

0:58:44.820000 - 0:58:46.380000::Blood pressure alcohol.
0:58:46.380000 - 0:58:46.900000::All right.

0:59:18.460000 - 0:59:19.460000::I was using analogy.
0:59:19.460000 - 0:59:25.260000::I was filling the water up every single day from the little water station.
0:59:25.260000 - 0:59:29.500000::And I was thought I was cleaning it out by like shaking around like Don dish soap in it
0:59:29.500000 - 0:59:32.420000::with hot water and just like pouring it out and whatever.
0:59:32.420000 - 0:59:33.780000::But I had never wiped it out.
0:59:33.780000 - 0:59:37.260000::And it's very vulnerable by the way of sharing story.

0:59:38.900000 - 0:59:42.980000::I don't it could have led to permanent damage because of what I found inside about right
