0:00:46.920000 - 0:00:50.800000::Perra is with us today. Can you believe it? Celebrities
0:00:51.040000 - 0:00:53.920000::all around us. Welcome, Joe.
0:00:53.920000 - 0:00:55.360000::Hopefully, hopefully, you'll hear.
0:00:55.360000 - 0:00:56.200000::Okay.
0:00:57.360000 - 0:00:59.200000::Joe, have you ever listened to smart lifts?
0:01:00.800000 - 0:01:05::No, I just saw the trailer for the documentary for the right
0:01:05 - 0:01:08.160000::around in the airplane, in the private plane in black and white.
0:01:08.360000 - 0:01:11.760000::In black and white. They have it like that. They got it like
0:01:11.760000 - 0:01:16.560000::that monetarily. But they talk for if you listen to it, they
0:01:16.560000 - 0:01:19.440000::talk for about eight minutes before they bring the guest on
0:01:19.440000 - 0:01:23::the guest is just on zoom silent. So it's fun to imagine like
0:01:23.120000 - 0:01:25.560000::Matthew McCommer, hey, being silent and like notting.
0:01:27 - 0:01:27.840000::Oh my God.
0:01:28.440000 - 0:01:31.120000::Let's come on really hot then because he probably has so many
0:01:31.120000 - 0:01:34.320000::ideas he does. Right. Well, Joe specifically, we were going to
0:01:34.320000 - 0:01:37.800000::do that and kind of riff. And I was going to do my show plug.
0:01:37.800000 - 0:01:39.840000::And we were going to talk about, but Joe was like, I need to
0:01:39.840000 - 0:01:43.160000::like get it up on the conversation like fucking immediately.
0:01:43.360000 - 0:01:47.040000::And it was like very demanding about how it would go down
0:01:47.040000 - 0:01:50.120000::before. But it has a rise to you. We want you to have a good,
0:01:50.560000 - 0:01:52.640000::good episode. And we want you to feel good. You know,
0:01:52.640000 - 0:01:56.520000::I'm saying at the end of the day, there's just a lot to say about
0:01:57 - 0:02:00.440000::wilderness and politics, everything.
0:02:01.640000 - 0:02:05.040000::Well, and that is kind of just dropped it on you guys on
0:02:05.040000 - 0:02:07.600000::listeners. That's what we're talking about today. No, no,
0:02:07.600000 - 0:02:09.720000::it's going to be the title of the thing. So they already know,
0:02:09.720000 - 0:02:13.840000::but we're talking about the wilderness today. And that could
0:02:13.840000 - 0:02:16.520000::mean so many different things couldn't it? Because there's
0:02:16.520000 - 0:02:19.840000::the natural wilderness, which is trees and streams and rocks
0:02:19.840000 - 0:02:23.680000::and rivers, what have you? It's what was here before us.
0:02:25.360000 - 0:02:27.800000::But then there's sort of a mental wilderness, which we will get
0:02:27.800000 - 0:02:30.720000::into, which I know you actually you're very familiar with.
0:02:30.760000 - 0:02:34.600000::Joe, that's where you go creatively to write your stories and
0:02:34.600000 - 0:02:35.200000::your standup.
0:02:36.760000 - 0:02:38.040000::Bring it bring it bring it back.
0:02:38.040000 - 0:02:40.520000::Like tropical fruit from the jungle.
0:02:41.040000 - 0:02:44.880000::That's it. Wow. Wow.
0:02:44.880000 - 0:02:48.040000::The is our fruit that can't go bad. They can only get better at
0:02:48.040000 - 0:02:49.240000::with the time and thought.
0:02:50.760000 - 0:02:53.480000::That's what they're like shimmying up the coconut tree with a
0:02:53.480000 - 0:02:55.520000::with the belt to get the coconut.
0:02:56.560000 - 0:03:00::Yeah, yeah, yeah, up to coconut tree like Jack said, maybe
0:03:00 - 0:03:03.640000::there's some why some cows on island you milk.
0:03:03.880000 - 0:03:09.720000::And we bring fake song bill bill from that. That one cow that
0:03:09.720000 - 0:03:14.200000::ran away into the wild. You know, that one got the good milk.
0:03:14.600000 - 0:03:16.040000::Well, I'll kill milk.
0:03:16.080000 - 0:03:19.960000::Imagine this cow milk and into your mouth and one hand coconut
0:03:19.960000 - 0:03:23.320000::milking into the other hand and you're just experiencing so many,
0:03:23.560000 - 0:03:25.160000::so many different kinds of milk.
0:03:25.680000 - 0:03:28.880000::Do you guys think a drunk farmer has ever sucked the milk straight
0:03:28.880000 - 0:03:32.680000::from the coming home from the from the ale house and start sucking
0:03:32.680000 - 0:03:33.800000::milk on the other.
0:03:34.680000 - 0:03:38.040000::He said, we want to other jacked off the other one.
0:03:38.040000 - 0:03:42.240000::Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, it's not good after you know,
0:03:42.240000 - 0:03:43.080000::that's not it.
0:03:43.600000 - 0:03:44.600000::Yeah.
0:03:47.160000 - 0:03:50.720000::Well, sometimes it's like, it's literally a favor to the cow because
0:03:50.720000 - 0:03:53.320000::that shit hurts if you leave that milk in there because they can't
0:03:53.320000 - 0:03:56.080000::even get there because there are hands that can reach down.
0:03:56.400000 - 0:03:57.840000::Is that true? It hurts them.
0:03:57.840000 - 0:03:59.600000::Literally, you have to melt in there.
0:04:01.080000 - 0:04:03.200000::Well, Joe, do you know about this? You have to melt them.
0:04:04.360000 - 0:04:08.360000::I went to dairy farm and she gave them a time when I was worried
0:04:08.440000 - 0:04:11.440000::because they hit the mechanized system now.
0:04:11.440000 - 0:04:14.280000::They kind of creep you look and they put it on.
0:04:16.280000 - 0:04:17.480000::And they apparently love it.
0:04:17.480000 - 0:04:21.960000::They like way to the line to use it because it feels it's early for them.
0:04:22.040000 - 0:04:26.320000::So it's as yours looks. I think they, I mean, you could have
0:04:26.360000 - 0:04:30.040000::issued the whole system, but this really at least in the short
0:04:30.040000 - 0:04:32.920000::term. That's amazing news.
0:04:33.120000 - 0:04:36.440000::And I thought we were abusing these animals, but no, they like it.
0:04:37.440000 - 0:04:39::They like it like that.
0:04:44.440000 - 0:04:48.440000::So why do we think that we don't have something like that for
0:04:48.440000 - 0:04:51.840000::people? And I'm not saying sexually, I'm like,
0:04:51.840000 - 0:04:53.640000::regulation in that. No, of course not.
0:04:53.760000 - 0:04:57.680000::Just forgetting things like milk out because what do people
0:04:57.680000 - 0:05:00::don't have milk build up, but everybody that

0:05:00 - 0:05:06.480000::has built, every human is built up with something, whether it's saliva, whether it's negative
0:05:06.480000 - 0:05:09.280000::comments on something.
0:05:09.280000 - 0:05:18.400000::When it's trauma, trauma from getting flipped off by Jim Teachers and everyone needs a release,
0:05:18.400000 - 0:05:20.120000::I think is what you're saying.
0:05:20.120000 - 0:05:31.360000::It needs to release some sort of anger, fluids, insults, you need to release at some point.
0:05:31.360000 - 0:05:33.400000::How are you going to do it?
0:05:33.400000 - 0:05:36.120000::Are you going to do it in the kickboxing, Jim?
0:05:36.120000 - 0:05:38.840000::How do you get out of your energy?
0:05:38.840000 - 0:05:39.840000::You all pent up from...
0:05:39.840000 - 0:05:40.840000::We were talking about this before.
0:05:40.840000 - 0:05:44.520000::You all pent up from doing another sold that show.
0:05:44.520000 - 0:05:48.360000::You have all this energy from all the admiration.
0:05:48.360000 - 0:05:51.840000::What do you do to get that energy out?
0:05:51.840000 - 0:05:56.200000::Well, I have a couple of beers with Carmen.
0:05:56.200000 - 0:05:59.040000::Yesterday we went to the sauna.
0:05:59.040000 - 0:06:00.720000::Sometimes we look for a sauna.
0:06:00.720000 - 0:06:02.880000::It's a good thing to do.
0:06:02.880000 - 0:06:06.760000::The one in Portland was great.
0:06:06.760000 - 0:06:12.680000::But everybody thought we were the only ones that were actually wearing bathing suits.
0:06:12.680000 - 0:06:14.680000::It was a nude.
0:06:14.680000 - 0:06:15.680000::Yes.
0:06:16.040000 - 0:06:22.600000::Collette granted some of the only people there under 60 years old.
0:06:22.600000 - 0:06:23.600000::Wow.
0:06:23.600000 - 0:06:25.400000::I'm a Friday morning.
0:06:25.400000 - 0:06:30.360000::But I think that sweating in and out is a good thing to do.
0:06:30.360000 - 0:06:32.240000::And then I kind of was jealous.
0:06:32.240000 - 0:06:33.520000::There were some guys.
0:06:33.520000 - 0:06:34.520000::There were just...
0:06:34.520000 - 0:06:37.040000::There were two houses that were connecting.
0:06:37.040000 - 0:06:40.800000::It was in the back sun, backyard, one guy even had.
0:06:40.840000 - 0:06:43.320000::He was just being belly.
0:06:43.320000 - 0:06:46.080000::I shouldn't talk about everybody's body.
0:06:46.080000 - 0:06:48.120000::It kind of goes against sauna code.
0:06:48.120000 - 0:06:52.320000::But he was just laying there with his genitalia towards the sauna.
0:06:52.320000 - 0:06:54.040000::And it felt like that.
0:06:54.040000 - 0:06:55.880000::That would feel great.
0:06:55.880000 - 0:07:00.720000::That would be probably a better release than I got with my swimsuit on.
0:07:00.720000 - 0:07:02.480000::Well, let me just say this.
0:07:02.480000 - 0:07:07.360000::I'm having a John belly in the sauna is a status symbol that people who are walking
0:07:07.360000 - 0:07:10.280000::around confident, slapping their flat feet around.
0:07:10.280000 - 0:07:13.600000::This is me, by the way, because that's how I address them.
0:07:13.600000 - 0:07:17.800000::But it is like it's the one place where you feel like this is all good.
0:07:17.800000 - 0:07:18.800000::Did you...
0:07:18.800000 - 0:07:19.800000::The kings of the...
0:07:19.800000 - 0:07:20.800000::The kings of the...
0:07:20.800000 - 0:07:22.800000::Oh, did they have bars?
0:07:22.800000 - 0:07:24.280000::They've come butchered on tap.
0:07:24.280000 - 0:07:25.280000::But the kings of the...
0:07:25.280000 - 0:07:31::Oh, I think from a male perspective are the really skinny old man with the
0:07:31 - 0:07:37.960000::extremely large penis and the very large fat man with the very small penis.
0:07:37.960000 - 0:07:38.960000::Those guys...
0:07:38.960000 - 0:07:42.040000::They're like, those are the higher runners, man.
0:07:42.040000 - 0:07:44.240000::Those are the entrance of the widen.
0:07:44.240000 - 0:07:45.240000::You have a...
0:07:45.240000 - 0:07:49.360000::There's a different hierarchy in the sauna than in the real world, you know?
0:07:49.360000 - 0:07:50.360000::Those people...
0:07:50.360000 - 0:07:51.360000::I don't have a demo.
0:07:51.360000 - 0:07:53.200000::On the streets.
0:07:53.200000 - 0:07:54.200000::Right.
0:07:54.200000 - 0:07:58.720000::You never know when you're looking at somebody what their position would be in the sauna
0:07:58.720000 - 0:07:59.720000::hierarchy.
0:07:59.720000 - 0:08:01.480000::In the real world, right?
0:08:01.480000 - 0:08:03.160000::You see them whatever.
0:08:03.160000 - 0:08:04.160000::Mm-hmm.
0:08:04.160000 - 0:08:07.920000::Sitting and playing with their wedding ring and a subway by themselves.
0:08:07.920000 - 0:08:16.640000::That cut to later in 30 minutes, that's basically the Batman of the sauna.
0:08:16.640000 - 0:08:19.280000::Joe, how hot do you like it?
0:08:19.280000 - 0:08:21.280000::Skinny with a coat can is the...
0:08:21.280000 - 0:08:23.200000::You know what I'm saying?
0:08:23.200000 - 0:08:26.200000::That is the ultimate powerful move.
0:08:26.200000 - 0:08:28.480000::No one's a special...
0:08:28.480000 - 0:08:30.480000::No one's a special...
0:08:30.480000 - 0:08:36.760000::Who do you think wins out the skinny with soda can or figure man?
0:08:36.760000 - 0:08:38.600000::It depends on the situation.
0:08:38.600000 - 0:08:42.720000::That's a curious question that you raised, Joe, because in a foot race, it's the skinny
0:08:42.720000 - 0:08:44.240000::with the coat can.
0:08:44.240000 - 0:08:47.120000::But in a sort of...
0:08:47.120000 - 0:08:54.440000::If it's like a feast style, whatever, you know, environment and...
0:08:54.440000 - 0:08:56.200000::I think it then is a bigger guy.
0:08:56.200000 - 0:08:58.200000::If it's a hot dog...
0:08:58.200000 - 0:09:00.200000::No, but that's not true.
0:09:00.200000 - 0:09:01.200000::It's a long distance race.
0:09:01.200000 - 0:09:02.200000::It's not true.
0:09:02.200000 - 0:09:06.640000::Well, because the skinny guys sometimes can eat the most, which is so interesting to
0:09:06.680000 - 0:09:07.640000::me, I don't know how they can...
0:09:07.640000 - 0:09:10.480000::Like Joey Chessons, kind of skinny, right?
0:09:10.480000 - 0:09:11.480000::Well...
0:09:11.480000 - 0:09:12.480000::Yeah.
0:09:12.480000 - 0:09:14.480000::Or one of those guys is hell skinny.
0:09:14.480000 - 0:09:16.480000::That was a cute Kobayashi, of course, is...
0:09:16.480000 - 0:09:17.480000::Yeah, a secure Kobayashi.
0:09:17.480000 - 0:09:21.760000::A 8% body fat, I can't believe it.
0:09:21.760000 - 0:09:25.720000::On the latest meta-dead, I don't know.
0:09:25.720000 - 0:09:30.440000::So Joe, when is the last time speaking of wilderness, when's the last time you really touch
0:09:30.440000 - 0:09:35.080000::nature like that, and you really unplugged?
0:09:35.080000 - 0:09:37.320000::You went for a nice hike in Asheville.
0:09:37.320000 - 0:09:45.080000::That's a nice way to get the release onto a low mining or peas and pews for your
0:09:45.080000 - 0:09:50.080000::anglers and so forth, or not losing money at the casino online.
0:09:50.080000 - 0:09:51.080000::Okay, sorry.
0:09:51.080000 - 0:09:55.080000::I've never lost yet.
0:09:55.080000 - 0:09:59.240000::I'll probably lose some day, but I've never lost yet.
0:09:59.240000 - 0:10:00::Not one single day.

0:10:00 - 0:10:02.640000::That's been not one hand.
0:10:02.640000 - 0:10:05.400000::It's really well.
0:10:05.400000 - 0:10:06.480000::That's great.
0:10:06.480000 - 0:10:10.240000::Yeah, we go and try to find the hike when we got the energy.
0:10:10.240000 - 0:10:11.960000::Asheville was really nice.
0:10:11.960000 - 0:10:15.280000::We went swimming in Vancouver.
0:10:15.280000 - 0:10:18.480000::South-Earthville kind of well-renecy.
0:10:18.480000 - 0:10:21.800000::But those were probably Asheville was probably
0:10:21.800000 - 0:10:25.640000::the last time of the big hike.
0:10:25.640000 - 0:10:26.400000::Is it possible?
0:10:26.400000 - 0:10:26.600000::Do you?
0:10:26.600000 - 0:10:28.760000::I don't know.
0:10:28.760000 - 0:10:30.160000::I have a question, Joe.
0:10:30.160000 - 0:10:34.040000::Do you have any fear in nature when you're on that hike
0:10:34.040000 - 0:10:36.680000::or anywhere do you have a fear that you're
0:10:36.680000 - 0:10:40.040000::going to brush up against a plant that
0:10:40.040000 - 0:10:42.240000::has poison ivy on it?
0:10:42.240000 - 0:10:45.720000::Are you fearful of a mountain lion of snakes?
0:10:45.720000 - 0:10:47.680000::This wilderness is a sudden exposure.
0:10:47.680000 - 0:10:49.040000::It's not like we're talking about the piece of it,
0:10:49.040000 - 0:10:50.560000::but the bug.
0:10:50.560000 - 0:10:54.520000::The nature in reality, if we want to get real,
0:10:54.520000 - 0:10:56.640000::is a dangerous place.
0:10:56.640000 - 0:11:02.240000::And we sometimes are modern form that we don't belong there.
0:11:02.240000 - 0:11:04.720000::So do you have any fear when you go into nature
0:11:04.720000 - 0:11:08.480000::that you're going to get fucked up by some shit out there?
0:11:08.480000 - 0:11:09.840000::The snakes get me.
0:11:09.840000 - 0:11:10.840000::I know.
0:11:10.840000 - 0:11:14.640000::I was on hiking in Arizona.
0:11:14.640000 - 0:11:15.400000::Beautiful hike.
0:11:15.400000 - 0:11:16.880000::I forget the name of it.
0:11:16.880000 - 0:11:19.320000::But it was outside the Tucson the whole time.
0:11:19.320000 - 0:11:23.400000::I kept on looking under the rocks before I took another step.
0:11:23.400000 - 0:11:25.160000::I don't know where a beautiful guy like me
0:11:25.160000 - 0:11:29.560000::has such a fear of serpents.
0:11:29.560000 - 0:11:32.280000::It's I think it returns to a spiritual level.
0:11:32.280000 - 0:11:36.080000::I think our fear of serpents is spiritual.
0:11:36.080000 - 0:11:39.880000::But did you say that back to the engine of Eden spirit?
0:11:39.880000 - 0:11:41.760000::It must be.
0:11:41.760000 - 0:11:43.320000::But I get stressed.
0:11:43.320000 - 0:11:46.080000::I dream that there are snakes in my bed.
0:11:46.080000 - 0:11:47.280000::Oh, God.
0:11:47.280000 - 0:11:48.440000::Are you kidding me?
0:11:48.440000 - 0:11:50.240000::That's the devil.
0:11:50.240000 - 0:11:51.120000::It might be.
0:11:51.120000 - 0:11:53.520000::Or just I think it might remember that it
0:11:53.520000 - 0:11:54.520000::seemed from glad.
0:11:54.520000 - 0:11:56.520000::Or it gets obsessed.
0:11:56.520000 - 0:12:00.520000::I think I might have come from there.
0:12:00.520000 - 0:12:03.520000::Yeah, that's.
0:12:03.520000 - 0:12:10.520000::What's interesting is that there are human snakes as well, especially
0:12:10.520000 - 0:12:14.160000::in the entertainment industry, which I'm no, you're familiar with.
0:12:14.160000 - 0:12:15.520000::We're not name dropping anybody.
0:12:15.520000 - 0:12:16.520000::We're not even gossiping.
0:12:16.520000 - 0:12:21.480000::We're just acknowledging that there are dark energies in the entertainment industry.
0:12:21.480000 - 0:12:23.480000::And we call them snakes and rats.
0:12:23.480000 - 0:12:28.840000::But and I just you don't got a spilling tea, but I just wanted to bring that up to play.
0:12:28.840000 - 0:12:33.840000::Do you have you know you're at a you're at a very you're very power I would say I would
0:12:33.840000 - 0:12:38.480000::say you're a power player in the comedy world in Hollywood.
0:12:38.480000 - 0:12:39.480000::Okay.
0:12:39.480000 - 0:12:41.480000::I would seriously say that.
0:12:41.480000 - 0:12:43.480000::And I want you to answer this honestly.
0:12:43.480000 - 0:12:44.480000::Okay.
0:12:44.480000 - 0:12:51.280000::Have you ever had any contact signed any sort of contract with some sort of illuminati
0:12:52.280000 - 0:12:57.280000::you know there was you're at some crazy mansion party you went to a back room.
0:12:57.280000 - 0:13:00.280000::There was a fluffy sitting right there playing dice.
0:13:00.280000 - 0:13:01.280000::Luffy.
0:13:01.280000 - 0:13:11.280000::Gabriel, Gabriel Eglaceus has about $600 on his arm all laid out $100 bills.
0:13:11.280000 - 0:13:14.280000::Have you have you been in contact with these people Joe?
0:13:14.280000 - 0:13:17.280000::No, I will not.
0:13:18.280000 - 0:13:37.280000::There was the only time that it got weird was we were about to shoot the first shot of our adult swim show and the man in Milwaukee were in all black suit sunglasses walked on enemy a he said I want.
0:13:37.280000 - 0:13:44.280000::You know I want you to put this in the shot that he handed me a printed out picture of the devil.
0:13:44.280000 - 0:13:52.280000::I can't do that.
0:13:52.280000 - 0:13:53.280000::You stood up.
0:13:53.280000 - 0:14:00.280000::You made a choice that day so few actors and actresses make that choice would make that choice.
0:14:00.280000 - 0:14:03.280000::They would actually put the shot in the devil.
0:14:03.280000 - 0:14:04.280000::Yeah.
0:14:04.280000 - 0:14:06.280000::I'm not doing that for her paper.
0:14:06.280000 - 0:14:07.280000::Yeah.
0:14:07.280000 - 0:14:09.280000::So the men in black came to you.
0:14:09.280000 - 0:14:10.280000::Men in black.
0:14:10.280000 - 0:14:11.280000::I don't know.
0:14:11.280000 - 0:14:12.280000::I know he said fine.
0:14:12.280000 - 0:14:19.280000::In that case, you know, just know that the show is going to be limited to three seasons.
0:14:19.280000 - 0:14:21.280000::Oh, he was gracious.
0:14:21.280000 - 0:14:23.280000::He gave you three seasons.
0:14:23.280000 - 0:14:27.280000::Yeah, because he wanted to give you a shot at least he wanted to see some of that.
0:14:27.280000 - 0:14:28.280000::Yeah, what?
0:14:28.280000 - 0:14:29.280000::But not too much.
0:14:29.280000 - 0:14:31.280000::Not till you got your head too big.
0:14:31.280000 - 0:14:32.280000::Yeah.
0:14:32.280000 - 0:14:37.280000::Well, we said we do have time to take a moment before we do this.
0:14:37.280000 - 0:14:46.280000::And we can't put priests come on set, sprinkle holy water on the camera and Parmjanties.
0:14:46.280000 - 0:14:47.280000::And we continue.
0:14:47.280000 - 0:14:48.280000::Yeah.
0:14:48.280000 - 0:14:51.280000::And I just want to say this is completely unrelated.
0:14:51.280000 - 0:14:56.280000::If you're just listening to the audio, there is a fifth square that is a picture of the devil right now.
0:14:56.280000 - 0:14:57.280000::But it is not.
0:14:57.280000 - 0:14:58.280000::Right.
0:14:58.280000 - 0:15:00.280000::Right.

0:15:00 - 0:15:01.440000::that is just a glitch.
0:15:02.400000 - 0:15:03.400000::Probably iOS.
0:15:04.400000 - 0:15:05::I was.
0:15:05.840000 - 0:15:07.640000::Do you imagine Joe pair in hell?
0:15:08.440000 - 0:15:09.200000::That'd be correct.
0:15:09.600000 - 0:15:11.800000::No, I could never imagine you and hell, Joe.
0:15:11.800000 - 0:15:14.200000::Like you're, I don't care what your religion is.
0:15:14.200000 - 0:15:17.960000::Only with, listen, I could imagine showing hell, but with two
0:15:17.960000 - 0:15:21.080000::getlin guns firing off all the fucking demons.
0:15:24 - 0:15:27.360000::Wearing all fucking side by side like green,

0:15:30.480000 - 0:15:33.240000::You put yourself in a bucket like you're lowering yourself into a well from
0:15:33.240000 - 0:15:36.120000::heaven and you're kind of like riding this little rope down into hell.
0:15:36.960000 - 0:15:37.560000::Hello.
0:15:38.080000 - 0:15:40.800000::I imagine you on, where's the devil at?
0:15:41.400000 - 0:15:44.400000::You're, you're like on a helicopter and you know how like that,
0:15:45.480000 - 0:15:49.040000::a mind-free guy, he would put like hooks into his back, you know,
0:15:49.440000 - 0:15:50.920000::and like hang from the ceiling.
0:15:50.920000 - 0:15:53.440000::Like you'd be on a helicopter that's like we're riding you around.
0:15:53.440000 - 0:15:57.160000::You got hooks in your back and you have fucking two fucking AK
0:15:57.160000 - 0:15:57.880000::47s.
0:15:57.880000 - 0:16:02::There's all these, these fucking demons that are trying to go on top of
0:16:02 - 0:16:04.440000::each other to make a mountain on top of each other and you like
0:16:04.440000 - 0:16:07::fucking firing off like unlimited amount of ammo.
0:16:10.240000 - 0:16:11.240000::And it's not all bad.
0:16:11.240000 - 0:16:12.600000::And then you fucking run out of the gatling.
0:16:12.640000 - 0:16:15.200000::You run out of the bullets and then you find the devil.
0:16:15.240000 - 0:16:16.360000::Oh shit, I'm all out.
0:16:16.360000 - 0:16:16.880000::Whoops.
0:16:16.880000 - 0:16:21.280000::And then you take a metal whip and whip the whip is a stodeth,
0:16:21.560000 - 0:16:22.600000::a tiny whip though.
0:16:22.600000 - 0:16:24.080000::It's really small.
0:16:24.440000 - 0:16:24.960000::Like a no.
0:16:25.800000 - 0:16:27.160000::And by the way, you're not alone.
0:16:27.160000 - 0:16:29.560000::Cause right behind you and your back, because they think at one

0:29:45.320000 - 0:29:50.720000::Landlocked nobody knows what could have made that type of impact in the earth. There's a wealth
0:29:50.720000 - 0:29:52.720000::Well
0:29:54.880000 - 0:29:58.160000::It's my cold could be a meteor
0:29:59.360000 - 0:30:01.360000::civilization

0:30:00 - 0:30:02.040000::tried to think out to the center of the years.
0:30:02.760000 - 0:30:05.280000::Well, I didn't want to go there so fast, but that's what we were
0:30:05.280000 - 0:30:05.880000::suspecting.
0:30:06.720000 - 0:30:08.040000::That's one of our theories.
0:30:09.440000 - 0:30:11.640000::You know, there, of course, there was a civilization.
0:30:11.640000 - 0:30:12.920000::I was like, let's just keep digging.
0:30:12.920000 - 0:30:15.960000::Oh, of course, think about how a rock forms.
0:30:16.080000 - 0:30:18.960000::It doesn't form from the outside in like one of those chocolates,
0:30:18.960000 - 0:30:21.720000::lindor chocolates, but minus the inside, right?
0:30:21.720000 - 0:30:22.720000::It goes the other way.
0:30:23.160000 - 0:30:24.840000::Let me ask from a poor question.
0:30:24.840000 - 0:30:25.320000::The core.
0:30:25.360000 - 0:30:26.280000::Hold on a second.
0:30:26.320000 - 0:30:29.600000::It started with the core and layer by layer, there was
0:30:29.600000 - 0:30:31.280000::civilizations, see what I'm saying?
0:30:32.440000 - 0:30:34.920000::Jinx, you guys, well, we've never seen a rock form.
0:30:34.920000 - 0:30:35.440000::Have we?
0:30:36.520000 - 0:30:38.480000::We know they've just that I think that,
0:30:39.200000 - 0:30:44.400000::aside from volcanic rock, all the rock that there is on the earth,
0:30:44.840000 - 0:30:46.160000::there's no new rock coming.
0:30:46.360000 - 0:30:46.640000::Right?
0:30:46.640000 - 0:30:47.080000::No, no, no, no.
0:30:47.080000 - 0:30:47.920000::How's it start though?
0:30:48.120000 - 0:30:49.320000::You can't make new rock.
0:30:49.440000 - 0:30:50.600000::It starts with dust.
0:30:51.480000 - 0:30:55.360000::The dust comes together hard enough or dirt.
0:30:55.400000 - 0:30:56.240000::Is that fact?
0:30:56.280000 - 0:30:58.160000::Do you know how rock is formed?
0:30:58.840000 - 0:30:59.600000::Yeah, sure.
0:30:59.680000 - 0:31:01.040000::There are a variety of ways.
0:31:01.240000 - 0:31:06.720000::And I'm not for this check, but I don't think rocks grow as like,
0:31:08.480000 - 0:31:10.560000::you saying they start at the size they start at?
0:31:11.520000 - 0:31:12.680000::And then they densify?
0:31:14.160000 - 0:31:15.800000::Oftentimes bigger.
0:31:16.240000 - 0:31:18.360000::I mean, I guess you could say that,
0:31:18.720000 - 0:31:22.680000::anius rock could grow as the lava forms on top of it.
0:31:22.680000 - 0:31:24.280000::A lot of rock is,
0:31:25.240000 - 0:31:30.640000::the nether that says goes under pressure and then is broken apart for some reason.
0:31:31.280000 - 0:31:31.720000::Okay.
0:31:31.920000 - 0:31:33.840000::So that's what we know as sand.
0:31:33.920000 - 0:31:34.720000::Dandruff.
0:31:36.480000 - 0:31:36.840000::Sure.
0:31:36.840000 - 0:31:38.240000::Yeah, that's a rough rock.
0:31:38.360000 - 0:31:39.520000::Irrstyle, Dandruff.
0:31:41.400000 - 0:31:43.640000::I'm so glad we got into geology.
0:31:43.640000 - 0:31:45.520000::I didn't think we would get there this episode.
0:31:45.520000 - 0:31:47.400000::I didn't think we'd get as deep into,
0:31:47.880000 - 0:31:52::but I'm quite loving this, this, this, this, uh,
0:31:52.400000 - 0:31:54::crazy ass discussion right now.
0:31:54.920000 - 0:31:56.400000::Do you want to understand the world?
0:31:56.400000 - 0:31:58.320000::You got to know when it's made out.
0:31:59.320000 - 0:32:00.480000::That is so true.
0:32:00.480000 - 0:32:00.720000::Right.
0:32:02.360000 - 0:32:03.320000::Otherwise, you don't.
0:32:03.320000 - 0:32:08.680000::Well, you mentioned world war and I'm wondering, Joe,
0:32:08.680000 - 0:32:13.360000::do you have like any sort of, I guess what's your plan for when,
0:32:13.360000 - 0:32:18.440000::because we just, we just felt the impact of a power grid sort of tech,
0:32:18.440000 - 0:32:21::cyber strike, cyber strike could do.
0:32:21.240000 - 0:32:24.440000::We have the planes grounded, Microsoft.
0:32:24.440000 - 0:32:24.960000::What is this?
0:32:24.960000 - 0:32:26.040000::What, what was the story?
0:32:26.040000 - 0:32:27.040000::Eric, you broke this.
0:32:27.040000 - 0:32:29.440000::You're, you're like the breaking news, uh,
0:32:29.440000 - 0:32:31.440000::correspondent in my life right now.
0:32:31.440000 - 0:32:36.120000::You just somehow have the, you have like the minute, like update of like the
0:32:36.120000 - 0:32:38.240000::Trump assassination and well,
0:32:38.240000 - 0:32:39.360000::Lou Dobbs is dead.
0:32:39.400000 - 0:32:41.080000::Lou Dobbs passed away badly.
0:32:41.200000 - 0:32:45.680000::No, uh, day or two ago, the conservative media pundit.
0:32:46.240000 - 0:32:48.680000::And yeah, there were, there's a global outage.
0:32:48.680000 - 0:32:49.680000::Do you know about this, Joe?
0:32:49.680000 - 0:32:51.560000::Were you affected by this at the airport?
0:32:52.560000 - 0:32:53.280000::Almost.
0:32:53.600000 - 0:32:57.680000::I guess almost all our air can of the flight was fine,
0:32:57.680000 - 0:32:59.520000::but we were driving to the airport.
0:32:59.520000 - 0:33:04.320000::We got up at 5 a.m. to go to Vancouver Airport to come down and the
0:33:04.320000 - 0:33:08.840000::Uber driver kind of got excited when we told them that our,
0:33:09.160000 - 0:33:14.040000::we got a message that our center flight could be canceled and use like 800 bucks.
0:33:14.040000 - 0:33:16.600000::I'll drive you to Portland right now.
0:33:16.840000 - 0:33:18.840000::I'll have you there by 10 a.m.
0:33:19.400000 - 0:33:20.040000::Oh my god.
0:33:20.960000 - 0:33:22.200000::Luckily, we decided.
0:33:22.720000 - 0:33:24.080000::Yeah, it was pretty cool.
0:33:24.080000 - 0:33:28.560000::He was like, I want to know we were flight was okay.
0:33:28.560000 - 0:33:29.080000::Thank you.
0:33:29.440000 - 0:33:31.480000::Oh, air Canada somehow was in effect.
0:33:32.040000 - 0:33:34.080000::But somehow he said you don't.
0:33:35.440000 - 0:33:38.400000::Wonder where the strike came from because they're probably on Apple.
0:33:39.480000 - 0:33:41.320000::It was only Windows devices.
0:33:41.320000 - 0:33:43.080000::How curious they're coming for Android.
0:33:43.720000 - 0:33:48.360000::How curious that this only affected Windows devices and how curious Tim Cook
0:33:48.360000 - 0:33:49.200000::hasn't been seen.
0:33:49.920000 - 0:33:55.200000::I bet he's that's been hacking that in a downstairs layer for months to try to
0:33:55.200000 - 0:33:55.960000::get this shit right.
0:33:55.960000 - 0:33:57.320000::Telling out the Windows machines.
0:34:01.400000 - 0:34:05.840000::All hopped up all caffeinated all ecstasyed out hacking.
0:34:06.720000 - 0:34:09.520000::That is the upcoming war.
0:34:09.600000 - 0:34:12.520000::They're worried about Democrats first with public hands.
0:34:12.520000 - 0:34:16.200000::It's really Microsoft was Apple versus right.
0:34:16.880000 - 0:34:20::Yeah, that's going to be and they like to say it's going to be bloodless.
0:34:20 - 0:34:21.880000::But actually it's quite the opposite.
0:34:21.880000 - 0:34:23.320000::It's going to be very gory.
0:34:23.960000 - 0:34:25.160000::It's going to be worse.
0:34:25.160000 - 0:34:28.800000::It's going to be you're going to see brain matter more than blood even because it's just what.
0:34:29.760000 - 0:34:30.520000::All about the brain.
0:34:30.520000 - 0:34:34.720000::Yeah, when I got that notification though that the way it said the New York Times
0:34:34.720000 - 0:34:35.520000::didn't know what it was.
0:34:35.520000 - 0:34:41.840000::So it was like planes are down banks are down all infrastructures failing.
0:34:42.840000 - 0:34:45.480000::I remember just thinking like this is what we had predicted.
0:34:45.880000 - 0:34:47.400000::This is what we had predicted.
0:34:48.200000 - 0:34:50.080000::It's what I think we got off easy this time.
0:34:50.840000 - 0:34:51.320000::What did that?
0:34:51.320000 - 0:34:52.440000::What let me ask then?
0:34:52.760000 - 0:34:55.360000::So Joe, what's in your what's in your bug out bag?
0:34:56.320000 - 0:34:57.640000::What's in the bug out bag, Joe?
0:34:59.160000 - 0:35:00.040000::Life's strong.

0:35:00 - 0:35:01::Knife.
0:35:01 - 0:35:05::Is it a butterfly knife?
0:35:05 - 0:35:07::No, more.
0:35:07 - 0:35:09::I got a cryptillion.
0:35:09 - 0:35:12::There's a nice leather leather man.
0:35:12 - 0:35:17::You could buy the leather man that have fire starter on it.
0:35:17 - 0:35:21::So if you get a non you can buy a fire starter.
0:35:21 - 0:35:29::You hang around your neck that's the fire and steel and you could carry with you to make the spark.
0:35:29 - 0:35:40::So think if you got those things, it would be, you'd be at least had a stomach chance without a knife or a fire you'd been trouble.
0:35:40 - 0:35:43::But I told Carm because you're.
0:35:43 - 0:35:51::Could I add something to your bug out bag just to protect you because I think you're thinking of like survival right now, but I don't think you think about how much.
0:35:51 - 0:36:01::You know, like sort of mad max style like violence human to human violence is going to happen where people are going to be fighting over goods and produce.
0:36:01 - 0:36:10::So can I add, I think you should get that tank of gasoline in there. So you can pour it on somebody and then flick your, your flint on them and like that could be a thing.
0:36:10 - 0:36:17::You know, you're like, oh, this person just has like a little knife. They're chilled. They don't have any weapons and you just douse them with some gasoline.
0:36:17 - 0:36:21::Like that fucking flint on them. White. They're ass on fire.
0:36:21 - 0:36:23::That's something to keep in mind, Joe.
0:36:23 - 0:36:27::That's a mind for you. They're green onion. You get their fucking their their.
0:36:27 - 0:36:29::Well, but here's the thing.
0:36:29 - 0:36:33::Because I think you should also get a magnet with a scope.
0:36:33 - 0:36:38::And then after you've killed them, hit the head shot them with the magnet with the scope.
0:36:38 - 0:36:41::Don't even look at that shit.
0:36:41 - 0:36:53::I just wondered if like they like yesterday, you saw that the news had like that the air that some flights were canceled in a bank system went down.
0:36:53 - 0:36:58::And then it's like immediately go kind of start your neighbor on fire.
0:36:58 - 0:37:02::This is it. This is it.
0:37:02 - 0:37:06::It got his toiletries and you just.
0:37:06 - 0:37:09::Your neighbor who's on a reality television show.
0:37:09 - 0:37:12::Right. Right. My neighbors are reality television. Sorry.
0:37:12 - 0:37:14::On the new into the passenger.
0:37:14 - 0:37:21::You know what's funny about this? Can I point out to the to the national security of the United States of America?
0:37:21 - 0:37:33::I'm going to get out now because what do you not want to be having people bring on airplanes? A gun, a bomb, a squib, or a bad attitude, a bad attitude, a baby.
0:37:33 - 0:37:36::Sometimes those are suck, suck.
0:37:36 - 0:37:41::Do you think that you should be allowed to have fire starting tools on a plane?
0:37:41 - 0:37:47::Do you think you should be allowed to have matches a box of matches on an airplane?
0:37:47 - 0:37:54::I have been doing that every day for a long time, bringing matches onto an airplane.
0:37:54 - 0:38:00::And in the back of my head, I'm thinking I could light my self or not myself because I wouldn't do that.
0:38:00 - 0:38:03::But light, you know, right.
0:38:03 - 0:38:08::I could disguise gasoline in so many things. You could soak a bug in gasoline and keep it in a box.
0:38:08 - 0:38:11::What's that? Go through security because you know what I'm saying?
0:38:11 - 0:38:12::Right. Right.
0:38:12 - 0:38:15::I'm going to be able to bring it to the plane.
0:38:15 - 0:38:16::Right.
0:38:16 - 0:38:19::Illegalize and bring matches onto airplanes.
0:38:19 - 0:38:22::Yo, do you know?
0:38:22 - 0:38:24::I don't know.
0:38:24 - 0:38:27::You could get it up to that. Why?
0:38:27 - 0:38:32::You bring your cigar, your cigar case and a box of matches.
0:38:32 - 0:38:33::Yeah.
0:38:33 - 0:38:34::For one or four.
0:38:34 - 0:38:35::Yeah.
0:38:35 - 0:38:40::And then I'm going to put it on the airplane right because there's a really small hole.
0:38:40 - 0:38:44::If you put your head all the way into the toilet, it light a Cuban.
0:38:44 - 0:38:46::And you just keep pressing the flush.
0:38:46 - 0:38:50::Uh oh, no one's going to know. No one's going to smell it.
0:38:50 - 0:39:00::They're sure it's a squirm opener arresting and kicked off airplane for smoking a cigar on.
0:39:00 - 0:39:02::You call them Cubans, but they're just like the.
0:39:02 - 0:39:05::They're just like the ones who are those like clothes, cigarettes.
0:39:05 - 0:39:06::Yeah.
0:39:06 - 0:39:07::Yeah.
0:39:07 - 0:39:08::A lot of miles.
0:39:08 - 0:39:09::A lot of miles.
0:39:09 - 0:39:20::What are you afraid that planes can go down and jungle or something when you and Sarah Gorn tour in South America and you need your matches to survive for white.
0:39:20 - 0:39:21::Well, no.
0:39:21 - 0:39:25::The last thing I'm afraid of is a plane crash for some foremost.
0:39:25 - 0:39:30::I beg for it because I want a moment like that where I can rise to the occasion because you see it in the movies.
0:39:30 - 0:39:34::Like dang, I think I'd be good in a low gravity disaster scenario.
0:39:34 - 0:39:36::And here's another thing.
0:39:36 - 0:39:39::You know what's fun when this turbulence.
0:39:39 - 0:39:41::You kind of.
0:39:41 - 0:39:47::If you kind of lift up kind of do like a wall sit on your chair.
0:39:47 - 0:39:50::You can kind of feel it in a more interesting way.
0:39:50 - 0:39:52::Zero gravity.
0:39:52 - 0:39:54::I just shared something horrible.
0:39:54 - 0:39:58::I heard that remember the challenger explosion.
0:39:58 - 0:40:00::I don't want to but yeah.

0:40:00 - 0:40:06.560000::Yeah, it came apart in mid air and we all thought they passed away immediately. Oh, no turns out. Oh, no
0:40:09.840000 - 0:40:11.840000::Still in the air after it came apart
0:40:13.040000 - 0:40:15.840000::Oh my god, they were worse. Well
0:40:16.720000 - 0:40:22.400000::Incident that way you brought them up. You had suspected you brought up the jungle sort of crash scenario where it's like
0:40:23.040000 - 0:40:28.720000::The plane crashes and yeah, there's like five people that survive. You're on an island lost style
0:40:29.040000 - 0:40:31.040000::It's used Sarah Sherman
0:40:32.080000 - 0:40:36.320000::James Johnson Johnson Johnson Marcello and
0:40:37.120000 - 0:40:41.120000::And the whole cast of SNL it's all current cast of SNL, but some are dead
0:40:42.080000 - 0:40:44.080000::We won't say who
0:40:44.560000 - 0:40:52.880000::Well, I was gonna ask like what do you think of like surviving in a sort of like cannibalistic way because like a lot of times in the scenarios
0:40:53.040000 - 0:40:54.400000::somebody's
0:40:54.400000 - 0:40:58.560000::Somebody's gonna, you know, eat another person, you know, just to survive or would you be like
0:40:58.560000 - 0:41:02.080000::I'm just gonna tap out like I don't think I need to survive like a little bit longer
0:41:02.560000 - 0:41:09.040000::Like if it's getting too cannibalism like I don't know. Maybe I just need to just starve to death and just pass out on this island
0:41:11.280000 - 0:41:16.800000::I don't think I would try everything I could do to 90 people. I don't think I
0:41:18.400000 - 0:41:24.080000::I think I don't I think you could make a pretty good goal without doing it, but then again
0:41:24.400000 - 0:41:29.680000::There was the if you guys see that movie about the soccer team that had to do that in the andies
0:41:31.040000 - 0:41:35.040000::They were in a mountain, which is a little bit tougher survival situation
0:41:35.040000 - 0:41:37.600000::And I think they only ate their dead teammates right?
0:41:38.560000 - 0:41:42::The one story story is true. It's very real
0:41:43.440000 - 0:41:45.440000::It's very real Jack
0:41:46.480000 - 0:41:50.880000::Wow, can we all say right now whether we would want our friends to do that to each other
0:41:51.360000 - 0:41:53.360000::I
0:41:53.360000 - 0:41:55.360000::Mean sure
0:41:56.320000 - 0:42:01.920000::Yeah, sure I've been in fact because when you eat mushrooms you they say that you're giving the mushrooms a lens into the world
0:42:02.400000 - 0:42:06.080000::So it's actually maybe something we should do for every funeral to just let everybody
0:42:06.800000 - 0:42:09.840000::Keep the cycle going keep the consciousness alive
0:42:11.040000 - 0:42:15.520000::Hmm, not the worst that you would offer yourself up you would offer your corpse
0:42:16.720000 - 0:42:19.520000::If I had passed way way yeah, why not
0:42:21.040000 - 0:42:23.040000::But keep the head intact
0:42:23.200000 - 0:42:27.680000::Yeah, yeah, they're a part sound because for people maybe show a little respect to like
0:42:28.960000 - 0:42:30.960000::You guys don't need to eat my eyeballs
0:42:31.920000 - 0:42:37.440000::Right genitals, but you know the packs you've been working out on that fucking boflex dude those packs really
0:42:38.560000 - 0:42:43.760000::Oh, we made it this was like an Estonian podcast and you had to wait for the translator to like
0:42:45.920000 - 0:42:49.840000::To translate what you're saying long pause and then respond to those questions
0:42:51.840000 - 0:42:53.840000::We're strangers
0:42:53.920000 - 0:43:00.560000::Interestingly theory like if people you know say like bodybuilders are kind of selfish because they eat so much
0:43:01.040000 - 0:43:03.040000::Protein and stuff like that
0:43:03.840000 - 0:43:07.920000::I'm sure maybe they're just looking out for their loved ones if they get in a right
0:43:08.160000 - 0:43:09.360000::situation
0:43:09.360000 - 0:43:12.560000::Or that's interesting put it on flesh for my
0:43:13.920000 - 0:43:17.440000::Friends and what type of marinade do you think you would be good in?
0:43:17.680000 - 0:43:22.800000::Joe like what what what would you want what do you think the perfect like if we had like the Weber grill out
0:43:23.440000 - 0:43:29.520000::We joe's dead. We're fucking slicing up his his thighs and pay what kind of like marina dd
0:43:30.960000 - 0:43:32.960000::You want you want
0:43:33.120000 - 0:43:37.760000::Something lighter like you know like the suvar came here and ate something you know not to it
0:43:38 - 0:43:43.680000::I feel like if you're barbecue and a friend that's gone too far and you like try to say it's too celebratory
0:43:43.680000 - 0:43:45.680000::Yeah
0:43:45.760000 - 0:43:48.080000::It should be a celebration should be a celebration
0:43:48.080000 - 0:43:53.120000::I think that's what that's my pretty celebration because when do you barbecue dude when you don't give a shit about anything
0:43:53.360000 - 0:43:55.520000::I'm sorry to the July 4th holiday, but
0:43:56.080000 - 0:44:00.160000::Think about respectful foods you make a slider you put the slider at a funeral day long
0:44:00.880000 - 0:44:02.880000::You know what I'm saying what else is out of out of funeral?
0:44:03.600000 - 0:44:06.560000::Hmm, I guess it depends what country you're in but
0:44:07.840000 - 0:44:10.640000::I could imagine like a little cup of sag paneer some
0:44:11.280000 - 0:44:13.280000::Joe in it
0:44:13.680000 - 0:44:15.680000::You want to cry yeah joe paris sag paneer

0:45:30.160000 - 0:45:37.040000::Is it smart if we go to Italy for a week and bank like half a year worth of podcasts
0:45:37.040000 - 0:45:38.040000::or the episodes?
0:45:38.040000 - 0:45:40.320000::So it's like a whole year of Italy.

0:45:45.800000 - 0:45:46.800000::A room all day.
0:45:48.160000 - 0:45:50.120000::This is a very obvious.
0:45:50.120000 - 0:45:52.920000::We can't even tell that we're in Italy like at all.
0:45:52.920000 - 0:45:53.840000::There's no.
0:45:55.080000 - 0:45:56.640000::You know what, Joe, you had on our lot.
0:45:56.680000 - 0:46:01.280000::This was a Patreon episode, but you were on the live show, our first
0:46:01.280000 - 0:46:05.040000::live show at the bellhouse and you were, and you were like
0:46:05.640000 - 0:46:10::cracking up at the thought of us doing a USO.
0:46:10.120000 - 0:46:12.880000::I think about it like sometimes in laugh about it, but you were like,
0:46:12.880000 - 0:46:18.280000::if we were doing a live podcast for the troops, how disappointed they would be.
0:46:18.800000 - 0:46:19.800000::So pissed.
0:46:24.720000 - 0:46:25.240000::Yeah.
0:46:25.360000 - 0:46:27.520000::Murray really cracking up in the thought of us.
0:46:27.520000 - 0:46:28.680000::No, no, it's over.
0:46:30.160000 - 0:46:34.440000::What's funny is that's the truth last year, but since we've made some small television
0:46:34.440000 - 0:46:40.160000::appearances, now they legit would be fucking getting violent to get up front and push
0:46:40.160000 - 0:46:40.880000::into the river.
0:46:40.880000 - 0:46:44.960000::There'll be some stampeding deaths in the credit just to get close.
0:46:46.600000 - 0:46:52::Well, kind of tying things to the other car because he'd been talking about, you
0:46:52 - 0:46:58.960000::know, if perhaps Trump had been a Carmen puts compromise, he's talking like a FBI guy.
0:46:58.960000 - 0:47:04.360000::If Trump was compromised last week, and we went into a civil war, would we be nervous
0:47:04.360000 - 0:47:04.840000::about it?
0:47:04.840000 - 0:47:15.920000::And I said, oh, because he said that if Trump was passed, he, the attention, or I'm sorry.
0:47:16.400000 - 0:47:26.520000::Can I, let me just, Carmen said that if he's happy Trump was not killed because then all
0:47:26.520000 - 0:47:30.480000::the attention would be on that as opposed to the release of his new standup special.
0:47:31 - 0:47:38.200000::But I was saying, if the civil, if there was a civil war started by an assassination,
0:47:38.760000 - 0:47:44.560000::and it's anything like the last civil war won't be so bad for podcasts with comedians,
0:47:44.560000 - 0:47:49.040000::because if you think about it, the last civil war, most of the time you're fighting like
0:47:49.680000 - 0:47:51.480000::three to five percent of your time.
0:47:51.600000 - 0:47:56.640000::And the rest of your time has been marched around and camping in the woods with your
0:47:56.960000 - 0:47:58.520000::friends pretty much.
0:47:59 - 0:47:59.840000::And blanket.
0:47:59.840000 - 0:48:00.640000::Potry pot.
0:48:00.640000 - 0:48:04.080000::Some, some of these guys will entertain around the campfire.
0:48:04.080000 - 0:48:10.200000::But Carmen, Carmen can do his hour or you guys go camp campsite, the campsite,
0:48:10.200000 - 0:48:12.720000::the whole podcast for the guys.
0:48:12.720000 - 0:48:14.320000::That's why our material.
0:48:14.840000 - 0:48:16.160000::Wow.
0:48:16.160000 - 0:48:21.680000::And I also would say we just podcast for the, for the, for the troops just follow all the
0:48:21.680000 - 0:48:22.680000::Miranda.
0:48:23.160000 - 0:48:28.120000::Well, if we, we could also podcast from the front lines, you podcasting you much, your best
0:48:28.120000 - 0:48:29.760000::friend killed senselessly.
0:48:30.080000 - 0:48:35::You know how press have like a certain helmet and they like, it's like a illegal, they
0:48:35 - 0:48:39.200000::should, they should build that into the sort of international war crimes.
0:48:39.200000 - 0:48:43::Like, podcasters have like crazy forever dog press helmet.
0:48:45.800000 - 0:48:46.800000::Well,
0:48:46.800000 - 0:48:50.880000::I think I'm fucking black jacket larger like a three person Pope mobile.
0:48:50.920000 - 0:48:55.760000::And we could kind of put them inside and just kind of tractor around
0:48:55.760000 - 0:48:59.560000::invincible style in the in the middle of it all in the conflict and really get
0:48:59.560000 - 0:49:00.680000::putting a mic out.
0:49:01.080000 - 0:49:01.600000::Yeah.
0:49:01.600000 - 0:49:03.480000::Have a mic on.
0:49:03.480000 - 0:49:05.760000::Yeah.

0:49:11.160000 - 0:49:11.800000::plunges.
0:49:15.160000 - 0:49:16.040000::But it's got a flame.
0:49:16.040000 - 0:49:17.040000::They're on the front.
0:49:17.280000 - 0:49:20.800000::You see those tanks from World War One, those early tanks with the whips on the front.
0:49:20.840000 - 0:49:22::That's what we had in the front.
0:49:22.800000 - 0:49:26.760000::They had like crazy ass metallic whips that would just as horrible, but they would run
0:49:26.760000 - 0:49:32.400000::what if the podcasters on the other side were like, they were pod guys on their side.
0:49:32.400000 - 0:49:33.880000::And like they were beefing with us.
0:49:33.880000 - 0:49:36.920000::Do you think it would be okay for us to battle each other?
0:49:36.920000 - 0:49:41.440000::You know, like we could only fight, but we could we could kill, but only like other
0:49:41.440000 - 0:49:46.200000::podcasters and there's a whole other separate sort of like the satisfaction of the
0:49:46.200000 - 0:49:47.800000::war podcasters.
0:49:48.800000 - 0:49:49.280000::You know,

0:49:56.840000 - 0:49:59.320000::Well, to admit, what's interesting is it's becoming a mix.

0:50:00 - 0:50:05::much of the media has become. Yeah. Yeah.

0:51:31.120000 - 0:51:32.120000::Shadow South.
0:51:33.920000 - 0:51:34.920000::He can't even move.
0:51:35.120000 - 0:51:38.520000::Just a metal coffin just uncomfortable so hot.
0:51:39.120000 - 0:51:42.440000::You got the blue tooth plane. You have a full blasting in
0:51:42.440000 - 0:51:43.120000::the ears, but
0:51:47.720000 - 0:51:49.720000::listen to that. Yeah, you'll put speakers.
0:51:50.720000 - 0:51:53.520000::The speakers are fucking the JBLs.
0:51:54.120000 - 0:51:54.720000::Yeah.
0:51:55.120000 - 0:51:56.120000::They went to this.
0:51:56.320000 - 0:51:59.920000::I follow a company on Instagram that does speakers for boats.
0:51:59.920000 - 0:52:03.320000::And I wonder if they reached out to them when like we're doing a top
0:52:03.320000 - 0:52:04.120000::secret project.
0:52:05.120000 - 0:52:05.320000::Sob,
0:52:05.920000 - 0:52:07.720000::Fugel first in the mex.
0:52:08.320000 - 0:52:09.120000::No doubt.
0:52:09.320000 - 0:52:11.720000::We're about to get some new tech because that's how a new tech is
0:52:11.720000 - 0:52:14.920000::invented through substance subsidies through the government,
0:52:15.120000 - 0:52:17.320000::through military industrial complex.
0:52:17.920000 - 0:52:19.120000::You hear that term?
0:52:19.920000 - 0:52:20.320000::Nope.
0:52:20.320000 - 0:52:23.320000::Tell a lot of our tech comes from it's military first and then they say,
0:52:23.320000 - 0:52:27.120000::Oh, yeah, this fucking bed that we made for,
0:52:28.320000 - 0:52:32.820000::you know, the sergeants in the military so they could hook up on a bed that
0:52:32.820000 - 0:52:34.520000::just is like, doesn't move much.
0:52:34.520000 - 0:52:35.920000::Yeah, that's a temporary bed.
0:52:36.520000 - 0:52:38.120000::We don't have any more ways for that.
0:52:38.520000 - 0:52:39.920000::Here you go to the public.
0:52:39.920000 - 0:52:40.520000::Take that.
0:52:42.320000 - 0:52:47.120000::And so we've we've funded the development of temporary mattresses.
0:52:47.420000 - 0:52:49.120000::And they're still charging us.
0:52:49.220000 - 0:52:51.720000::$5,000 for wow.
0:52:51.720000 - 0:52:52.220000::Yeah.
0:52:52.220000 - 0:52:53.120000::That interesting.
0:52:53.220000 - 0:52:53.920000::Yeah.
0:52:54.020000 - 0:52:59.720000::Makes you almost want to start a coup makes you want to be violent.
0:52:59.920000 - 0:53:02.520000::Makes you want to be violent towards the officials.
0:53:02.520000 - 0:53:04.720000::The temper ptick is CEO's house.
0:53:08.720000 - 0:53:11.920000::With friends and just ask and just talk to them.
0:53:12.920000 - 0:53:13.720000::I like.
0:53:13.720000 - 0:53:17.120000::Have you guys be maybe in the other direction of you guys?
0:53:17.220000 - 0:53:22.220000::Like done the youtuber guys are sleeping on the floor and trying to get good sleeping on the floor.
0:53:22.420000 - 0:53:23.520000::That's kind of wilderness.
0:53:24.520000 - 0:53:24.720000::Right.
0:53:24.720000 - 0:53:29.720000::If you can sleep on the floor, that's worth more money than that type of peedig mattress.
0:53:30.520000 - 0:53:31.120000::Wow.
0:53:31.120000 - 0:53:33.920000::Is that good for your spine to sleep on the floor?
0:53:35.220000 - 0:53:36.420000::The guy's claim it is.
0:53:36.420000 - 0:53:39.920000::It takes your body some time to adjust for once you could do it.
0:53:40.020000 - 0:53:42.620000::I mean, I have campers to do it.
0:53:43.220000 - 0:53:54.020000::If you can learn how to be comfortable and attend or just have had in the woods, you can kind of, you know, you can adapt to not even meeting that.
0:53:54.720000 - 0:53:59.720000::That's why I think it would be I would rather that there's a silver war out.
0:54:00.020000 - 0:54:04.520000::Figure out a way to just get into the woods and hopefully be like a long.
0:54:05.520000 - 0:54:06.520000::You're off the grid.
0:54:07.620000 - 0:54:08.620000::During his.
0:54:09.620000 - 0:54:10.620000::Confident.
0:54:13.220000 - 0:54:13.720000::Wow.
0:54:14.220000 - 0:54:16.020000::A statement of peace from Joe Perry.
0:54:16.020000 - 0:54:16.420000::Right.
0:54:16.420000 - 0:54:17.220000::We love that.
0:54:17.720000 - 0:54:22.820000::Well, I like what you're looting to Joe and that's the fact that human beings are very adaptable creatures.
0:54:23.420000 - 0:54:28.720000::And if we weren't adaptable, we would have been killed off by some other type of animal that was competing for resources.
0:54:29.720000 - 0:54:30.020000::Right.
0:54:30.220000 - 0:54:32.520000::It's just something that we seem to forget a lot.
0:54:32.920000 - 0:54:36.820000::Well, we talk about habituating a lot and I think that's good to habituate.
0:54:37.720000 - 0:54:37.920000::Just.
0:54:37.920000 - 0:54:38.420000::Yeah.
0:54:42.220000 - 0:54:43.020000::Can I have a though?
0:54:43.120000 - 0:54:43.320000::Yeah.
0:54:44.120000 - 0:54:45.120000::You know, I think we have.
0:54:45.120000 - 0:54:49.320000::I think we really had it kind of covered it.
0:54:49.520000 - 0:54:50.920000::We kind of covered the wilderness.
0:54:51.120000 - 0:54:55.120000::Well, you know, we didn't get into the mental wilderness as much as I would like to, which you mentioned.
0:54:55.120000 - 0:54:55.620000::Right.
0:54:55.920000 - 0:54:59.320000::And we didn't get into the etymology because that's such a crazy word.

0:55:00 - 0:55:04.480000::wilderness. Why didn't they just call it the wild? I guess they did.
0:55:04.480000 - 0:55:06.880000::Right. In some cultures, it is called the wild.
0:55:08.320000 - 0:55:12.640000::Okay. Wow. Well, there's more. I think people like this where there's
0:55:12.640000 - 0:55:17.040000::there's much more to discuss. Like we don't fully cover everything because we want the
0:55:17.520000 - 0:55:23.040000::audience, you know, begging for the park to, you know, when Joe comes back or something,
0:55:23.040000 - 0:55:28::and we can talk about it further in a different way, you know what I'm saying? But um,
0:55:28.080000 - 0:55:33.040000::we'd love to, we'd love to hear what you guys' settlement in the woods would be like,
0:55:33.040000 - 0:55:35.280000::if you guys could run your own.
0:55:36.800000 - 0:55:41.040000::Is that good? I don't have. Yeah. And if there's like a civil war,
0:55:41.040000 - 0:55:45.680000::we would go, Joe, would you kind of come back on the podcast as like a correspondent and we can
0:55:45.680000 - 0:55:51.760000::kind of like talk to you. We can talk about like from your wilderness area, just your takes on it.
0:55:51.840000 - 0:55:52.400000::Like,
0:55:54.880000 - 0:56:01.600000::Sure. I don't know. That's the thing. Yeah. All these people like to dance
0:56:01.600000 - 0:56:07.440000::about the fighting and stuff. But you can just hang out with friends of the woods if you wanted to.
0:56:07.680000 - 0:56:11.440000::And if anybody wants to go out, I'll choke you from the front.
0:56:11.440000 - 0:56:20.720000::Choke it out because I don't know. I just, yeah. I guess I don't want to give people a way to
0:56:20.720000 - 0:56:27.040000::kill themselves through me. But this is, move on, move on. Wait, are you volunteering yourself to
0:56:27.040000 - 0:56:28.240000::do mercy killing?
0:56:31.280000 - 0:56:34::Exist to the slow mercy killing.
0:56:35.760000 - 0:56:45.840000::I'm here to be a high people. A lot of people they, all I'm saying is a lot of people choke people
0:56:45.840000 - 0:56:50.640000::out from the behind them. And I just think there could be a warmer way to do it from the
0:56:50.640000 - 0:56:58.320000::front. A smiling eye contact. Oh, okay. A belly. A belly. A belly. A belly choke out.
0:56:58.320000 - 0:57:03.760000::Death, Mercy Kill. You know, our belly, a belly theory, Joe, you know, about the belly,
0:57:03.760000 - 0:57:09.920000::the belly theory. The idea is men are naturally violent. Men naturally have conflict and so do
0:57:09.920000 - 0:57:15.440000::women. That's just a human thing. But if you go up to someone all naked and go belly to belly
0:57:15.440000 - 0:57:19.920000::and just sit in that feeling for a while, you touch the skin to skin like a mother to child.
0:57:20.880000 - 0:57:27.040000::That's natural. You will naturally start to laugh and giggle and be connected in a new way.
0:57:28.400000 - 0:57:33.600000::And it's very unlikely that that beef will continue after something like that. Right.
0:57:33.600000 - 0:57:39.440000::Well, it's pathetic. It's pathetic how under, under taken seriously, if there's a word for that,
0:57:39.440000 - 0:57:46.640000::the belly button has become because that is your original spiritual and the whole of love.
0:57:46.640000 - 0:57:52.320000::The poor connected to your mother and to the entire universe through your belly button. Now,
0:57:52.320000 - 0:57:55.760000::it's a fucking afterthought. We got Kyle X Y treating it like a fucking joke.
0:57:57.920000 - 0:58:03.200000::If Hitler and fucking Churchill went belly to belly, or even belly to ear,
0:58:05.040000 - 0:58:13.360000::you feel you feel Jack that we somehow had now, not be like tells that so often we could at one
0:58:13.360000 - 0:58:15.360000::point connect to.
0:58:18.480000 - 0:58:26.160000::Is it those proofs? It's proven. The belly, nobody knows what, so you have an umbilical cord
0:58:26.160000 - 0:58:29.840000::when you're born, nobody knows what that connects to on the inside because it's connected to the
0:58:29.840000 - 0:58:35.600000::belly. Maybe on the inside, we don't know. Right. We can't see inside of there. Right.
0:58:35.600000 - 0:58:40.640000::I have a theory that there's an organ inside of your heart that we don't know about. And maybe that's
0:58:40.640000 - 0:58:44.720000::where the soul comes from because what makes the heart tick salt. I don't fucking know.
0:58:45.440000 - 0:58:50.720000::But I just think back feeling there's a reason I'm sorry, I'll just end on this. There's a reason
0:58:51.280000 - 0:59:00.080000::that society wants us to wear shirts. Oh, interesting. I was going to say, do you think there's a
0:59:00.080000 - 0:59:06.160000::like really early on in human history? Like when we first developed our brains, like when the,
0:59:06.160000 - 0:59:10.400000::when people were pregnant, do you think there's one guy who was just like trying to peak up inside
0:59:10.400000 - 0:59:14.480000::to see like what was going on in there? They're probably more than one.
0:59:17.600000 - 0:59:25.600000::I would never do that. But okay, well, I feel like we've sort of broken it all down and Joe,
0:59:25.600000 - 0:59:28.880000::I appreciate you kind of helping us do this thought experiment today on wilderness.
0:59:31.200000 - 0:59:37.760000::But at the end of our podcast, Joe, we like to go around and sort of meditate on what has given us
0:59:37.760000 - 0:59:43.680000::joy. And so I guess we could start. You can think about your joy for a second,
0:59:43.680000 - 0:59:48.720000::but we're going to go around, around Robin and just go tell us what gave us joy, Jack.
0:59:48.720000 - 0:59:51.040000::I know you have some gambling winnings you'd like to report.
0:59:54.080000 - 0:59:59.760000::I admit real man doesn't talk about his money. So let's just say I'm the opposite of down.

1:00:00 - 1:00:06::But I will say that my joy, of course, how could it not be the arts?
1:00:06 - 1:00:09::Art makes me go crazy, makes me wonder how everybody in the world.
1:00:09 - 1:00:12::But there's a movie called La Cabina.
1:00:12 - 1:00:17::Okay? 1972, it's a TV short, and it's pretty funny.
1:00:17 - 1:00:23::It's a foreign film, and it's simple, and it's a peaceful and joyful remix on phone booth.
1:00:23 - 1:00:26::The movie would call it barrel, I believe.
1:00:26 - 1:00:30::Even though it's from the past, so technically that's a remix of the, you see what I'm saying?
1:00:30 - 1:00:37::But this one, the guy is ducking a phone booth for the whole movie, and he's just stuck.
1:00:37 - 1:00:39::And it's pretty funny what ends up happening.
1:00:39 - 1:00:42::It's fucking strange. I'll say it.
1:00:42 - 1:00:43::I don't want to spoil it.
1:00:43 - 1:00:45::Strange fucking strange art.
1:00:45 - 1:00:47::It's very strange.
1:00:47 - 1:00:50::I say something about phone booth real quick.
1:00:50 - 1:00:55::Yeah. Do you remember the, those like sound boards that they would have, like, early internet?
1:00:55 - 1:00:59::There was one like print call sound board that you could use.
1:00:59 - 1:01:04::And like all of them were kind of like peer-grip in like saying what's up or whatever.
1:01:04 - 1:01:08::And then one of them was like the monologue from phone booth with like this sniper calling.
1:01:08 - 1:01:13::Like, I have a sniper, like a sniper pointed at you.
1:01:13 - 1:01:16::I am like, and it's like really scary.
1:01:16 - 1:01:22::And that was like one of the print calls that you could make up through the, through the sound board.
1:01:22 - 1:01:25::Fuck wild.
1:01:25 - 1:01:29::Well, let me tell you about what gave me joy.
1:01:29 - 1:01:34::It was I made, I made some meatloaf.
1:01:34 - 1:01:35::Whoa.
1:01:35 - 1:01:39::Honestly, I honestly kind of forgot about that food item.
1:01:39 - 1:01:40::The meatloaf.
1:01:40 - 1:01:41::It's good.
1:01:41 - 1:01:42::So it's so easy to make.
1:01:42 - 1:01:50::Like you just, you just mix a bunch of meat and fucking, I made it with Greek yogurt, you know, kind of tried to make it a little healthier.
1:01:50 - 1:01:56::But I can't help but remit like I'm a person that do you, Eric, I feel like you cook a lot.
1:01:56 - 1:01:59::Do you really stay strict to the recipe?
1:01:59 - 1:02:00::Because do I know?
1:02:00 - 1:02:03::Listen, you got to mix it up remix it for yourself.
1:02:03 - 1:02:07::That's what I was remixing it in just.
1:02:07 - 1:02:08::I don't know.
1:02:08 - 1:02:13::A ways that I was scared of, you know, like is this going to totally fuck up the love, the meatloaf.
1:02:13 - 1:02:19::But I just take those breaking shaking, putting like a little extra dashes on.
1:02:19 - 1:02:22::I just, but it turned out really well.
1:02:22 - 1:02:23::It was good.
1:02:23 - 1:02:25::It was pretty moist, you know, it was cooked.
1:02:25 - 1:02:33::Well, but yeah, shout out to the, shout out to the meatloaf, man.
1:02:33 - 1:02:34::Meatloaf.
1:02:34 - 1:02:36::Okay, I'll go real quick.
1:02:36 - 1:02:39::We have moved into our new house and it has been infested.
1:02:39 - 1:02:42::Well, the neighbors have an infestation of bees right behind us.
1:02:42 - 1:02:44::So what a bad omen took them into right.
1:02:44 - 1:02:48::And I've been having to sweep about literally all Sunday.
1:02:48 - 1:02:49::You guys have a picture.
1:02:49 - 1:02:51::It's just hundreds of bees all dead on the ground.
1:02:51 - 1:02:53::And by the way, they're not in the neighbor's property.
1:02:53 - 1:02:56::They're no work to be found, except for our on our patio.
1:02:56 - 1:03:00::So I feel like this is a sign from someone to leave.
1:03:00 - 1:03:02::But anyways, last night, swept them all up.
1:03:02 - 1:03:07::I was feeling kind of down about that door patio, but swept them up, put their bodies into a puerta.
1:03:07 - 1:03:09::And then we made some margaritas.
1:03:09 - 1:03:11::And we sat on our back porch.
1:03:11 - 1:03:16::And we still despite the negative thing that happened, we still had a good time outside.
1:03:16 - 1:03:17::Wow.
1:03:17 - 1:03:22::And listen to some music on Bluetooth speakers in our dog ran all around.
1:03:22 - 1:03:25::And so that was a joyful moment.
1:03:25 - 1:03:33::And I said this before the pod, but I'll repeat it now, but that Eric's life is like a, it's like a horror movie that never starts.
1:03:33 - 1:03:34::It's just all these like kind of.
1:03:34 - 1:03:36::And I don't understand what that means fully.
1:03:36 - 1:03:38::I don't fully understand what that means.
1:03:38 - 1:03:40::But I think you're right.
1:03:40 - 1:03:44::Like the first 10 minutes of a horror movie were just kind of like things seem a little off.
1:03:44 - 1:03:46::Like what the hell is that?
1:03:46 - 1:03:47::Yeah.
1:03:47 - 1:03:48::Yeah.
1:03:48 - 1:03:49::It's a dead rack of the.
1:03:49 - 1:03:50::And on the doorstep.
1:03:50 - 1:03:52::Oh, yeah, Joe, you know about this.
1:03:52 - 1:03:56::Maybe I found some all these bones in my car.
1:03:56 - 1:03:57::In the grill of my car.
1:03:57 - 1:03:59::Like this is.
1:03:59 - 1:04:01::One day, I thought there were some sticks sticking out.
1:04:01 - 1:04:03::It's all these bones.
1:04:03 - 1:04:08::You gotta start saving it for when you get into a few.
1:04:08 - 1:04:10::All these bees.
1:04:10 - 1:04:12::You gotta put in the pocket.
1:04:12 - 1:04:14::You gotta put out the rat bones.
1:04:14 - 1:04:15::And rat bones.
1:04:15 - 1:04:16::Barat bones, bees.
1:04:16 - 1:04:17::You don't have to be nasty about it.
1:04:17 - 1:04:19::Put that on someone else.
1:04:19 - 1:04:20::Yeah, exactly.
1:04:20 - 1:04:21::Yeah.
1:04:21 - 1:04:26::Oh, you don't want to make my script and then it's like the guy who's not a boss head.
1:04:26 - 1:04:28::But except for you got your bottom of the beast.
1:04:28 - 1:04:31::And I don't know how they, producers work.
1:04:31 - 1:04:33::So I do it to a line producer who's.
1:04:33 - 1:04:35::Getting by.
1:04:35 - 1:04:37::You dump it all out.
1:04:37 - 1:04:38::You dump it all out.
1:04:38 - 1:04:41::Bucket of bees on your head in front of them and just screaming.
1:04:41 - 1:04:44::Oh, Jesus.
1:04:44 - 1:04:48::Okay, we're also curious.
1:04:48 - 1:04:57::Swimming for me, I'm the best thing you could do is have an afternoon to go swimming.
1:04:57 - 1:05:00::We went swimming in Nashville.

1:05:00 - 1:05:07.120000::and a reservoir by a dam. It was okay. It was pretty good, but it was nice. Then in Vancouver,
1:05:07.120000 - 1:05:14.160000::they got these pools right by the water, by the ocean, because I guess it's sometimes too cold in.
1:05:15.120000 - 1:05:20.240000::I guess they think they're in a little dirty in the day, so they swim in these pools. The
1:05:20.240000 - 1:05:27.280000::Carmen I got to swim in the pool and Vancouver. And then yeah, just open the keepswomen.
1:05:28 - 1:05:34::Every time we're in a new place this week, it'll be a great place for swimming,
