0:00:00 - 0:00:07.480000::I think that Michael Scott, I think that Steve Curel blows Ricky Gerrace out the water.
0:00:07.480000 - 0:00:09.160000::I'll just say it like that.
0:00:09.160000 - 0:00:11.320000::Don't just have to say it like that.
0:00:11.320000 - 0:00:13.160000::Dude, that's the go!
0:00:13.160000 - 0:00:14.560000::That's the go!
0:00:14.560000 - 0:00:16.200000::Are you kidding me?
0:00:16.200000 - 0:00:17.200000::Hey, sir!

0:00:37.280000 - 0:00:39.480000::Blu-blu-blu-blu-blu.
0:00:39.480000 - 0:00:47.600000::You remember rap battles of history where they would do like a president versus broccoli?
0:00:47.600000 - 0:00:48.800000::Oh my god, yeah.
0:00:48.800000 - 0:00:49.600000::Oh shit.
0:00:49.600000 - 0:00:53::Well, TV versus movies.
0:00:53 - 0:00:56.840000::I was trying to do a siren for emergency episode.
0:00:56.840000 - 0:00:57.840000::Oh yeah.
0:00:57.840000 - 0:00:58.840000::Alright, go ahead.
0:00:58.840000 - 0:01:01.360000::We just discussed when you were getting water.
0:01:01.360000 - 0:01:08.840000::Maybe we shouldn't mention that we're recording this previously.
0:01:08.840000 - 0:01:12.800000::This is an episode that we'll put out if we mess up when we hear something like that.
0:01:12.800000 - 0:01:15.040000::We could be slick about it.
0:01:15.040000 - 0:01:16.040000::People will never have to know.
0:01:16.040000 - 0:01:17.840000::It'll just go into the rotation.
0:01:17.840000 - 0:01:18.840000::So I'm ruining it.
0:01:18.840000 - 0:01:19.840000::So I'm ruining it.
0:01:19.840000 - 0:01:21.760000::Within two seconds of recording.
0:01:21.760000 - 0:01:26.560000::Is that the point where I'm getting sick of myself and you guys?
0:01:26.560000 - 0:01:29.840000::Or you don't know what it's like to be in a body that you want to destroy?
0:01:29.840000 - 0:01:31.840000::You know what I'm saying?
0:01:31.840000 - 0:01:32.840000::I don't know.
0:01:32.840000 - 0:01:35.280000::Yeah, I guess I could see that.
0:01:35.280000 - 0:01:37::I mean, be here any more.
0:01:37 - 0:01:40.160000::Well, let's just say that all was a joke.
0:01:40.160000 - 0:01:43.240000::Did we raise a while back or did we not?
0:01:43.240000 - 0:01:44.240000::Who knows?
0:01:44.240000 - 0:01:46.440000::Based on our facial hair, you might think.
0:01:46.440000 - 0:01:49.720000::And our head hair, you might think, is this old?
0:01:49.720000 - 0:01:54.480000::Based on the fact that I'm not in the streaming out of my car that I'll be living in after
0:01:54.480000 - 0:01:56.320000::I do what I do over the holidays.
0:01:56.320000 - 0:01:59.080000::Oh, Jack's back in the apartment who let him back in.
0:01:59.080000 - 0:02:00.080000::Nope.
0:02:00.080000 - 0:02:01.080000::Right.
0:02:01.080000 - 0:02:02.080000::We don't know.
0:02:02.080000 - 0:02:07.160000::Something tells me that there's going to be a big signifier that this is recorded months
0:02:07.160000 - 0:02:08.160000::ago.
0:02:08.160000 - 0:02:13.560000::Like you said, Jack's going to be living in the car or I have both my arms.
0:02:13.560000 - 0:02:14.560000::Nates off the metal.
0:02:14.560000 - 0:02:15.560000::Yeah.
0:02:15.560000 - 0:02:16.560000::Yeah.
0:02:16.560000 - 0:02:17.560000::And.
0:02:17.560000 - 0:02:18.560000::Yeah.
0:02:18.560000 - 0:02:19.560000::Yeah.
0:02:19.560000 - 0:02:22.400000::Well, let's listen.
0:02:22.400000 - 0:02:27.080000::We're both, I mean, all three.
0:02:27.080000 - 0:02:34.360000::All three of us are extremely well versed, not just in podcasting, not just in martial arts,
0:02:34.360000 - 0:02:39.640000::not just in fashion and not just in motivation and whatever.
0:02:39.640000 - 0:02:42.240000::More so to the point TV and movies.
0:02:42.240000 - 0:02:46.200000::These are things that we literally the three of us grew up watching.
0:02:46.200000 - 0:02:47.200000::Yeah.
0:02:47.200000 - 0:02:51.760000::So our history goes, how long does it take to get a degree in college four years?
0:02:51.760000 - 0:02:59.440000::If you're like me, four years, if you're like me, say six or seven.
0:02:59.440000 - 0:03:00.440000::Nope.
0:03:00.440000 - 0:03:04.800000::Four simple years is all it took for me to get a degree in journalism and theater, minor
0:03:04.800000 - 0:03:05.800000::and theater.
0:03:05.800000 - 0:03:07.920000::I just got a pretty funny text message.
0:03:07.920000 - 0:03:08.920000::What is it?
0:03:08.920000 - 0:03:09.920000::Say it now and don't.
0:03:09.920000 - 0:03:14.280000::This is from Brace, Belvin of true and I don't fuck with because he's a fucking weirdo.
0:03:14.280000 - 0:03:19::But he just texted me, do you know any producers?
0:03:19 - 0:03:20::Any producer?
0:03:20 - 0:03:22::That could mean so many.
0:03:22 - 0:03:23::I just think it's so many.
0:03:23 - 0:03:25.760000::Yeah, I know some producers.
0:03:25.760000 - 0:03:27.360000::This is a great segue.
0:03:27.360000 - 0:03:34.880000::This is a great fucking segue because we are, you know, we're one of the few people that
0:03:34.880000 - 0:03:37.800000::are, yes, we are podcasters, of course.
0:03:37.800000 - 0:03:38.800000::We love it.
0:03:38.800000 - 0:03:40.080000::We love doing this.
0:03:40.080000 - 0:03:46.360000::But we are one of the few podcasters that also have their toes dipped into the Hollywood
0:03:46.360000 - 0:03:53.040000::system in a way that is, that we are basically entrenched in it.
0:03:53.040000 - 0:03:55.040000::Our whole foot is in the pool.
0:03:55.040000 - 0:03:59.720000::We put our whole foot in the industry.
0:03:59.720000 - 0:04:04.480000::And a lot, see, Brace is somebody who is, he's just a, I don't want to say he's just
0:04:04.480000 - 0:04:09.240000::a podcaster, but like he's, that's his whole world, you know what I'm saying?
0:04:09.240000 - 0:04:14.920000::But in it's simple, it's literally just words on a fucking recorded audio track and put
0:04:14.920000 - 0:04:17.480000::onto line, online.
0:04:17.480000 - 0:04:22.840000::Whereas movies and TV, you were matching the visual with the audio at the same time.
0:04:22.840000 - 0:04:23.840000::Thank you.
0:04:23.840000 - 0:04:28.400000::So it's, thank you, man.
0:04:28.400000 - 0:04:31.680000::So I'll immediately hear you during a different ballpark.
0:04:31.680000 - 0:04:32.680000::Right.
0:04:32.680000 - 0:04:37.120000::Because of the visual, due to that element, it's because, but more so due to the intertwining
0:04:37.120000 - 0:04:38.520000::of the two elements.
0:04:38.520000 - 0:04:43.480000::The whole story telling, which is essentially storytelling is, well, why do they call it
0:04:43.480000 - 0:04:44.480000::that?
0:04:44.480000 - 0:04:49.240000::I guess it should be, well, it should be visual, visual and auditory telling.
0:04:49.240000 - 0:04:50.240000::Telling.
0:04:50.240000 - 0:04:51.240000::Yeah.
0:04:51.240000 - 0:04:54.640000::And let me ask you this, when did the radio come out?
0:04:54.640000 - 0:04:56.480000::Probably in 1910s.
0:04:56.480000 - 0:05:00.960000::Everything, I feel like every invention comes out like the, the, the, the, the, the, the
0:05:00.960000 - 0:05:01.960000::thing.
0:05:01.960000 - 0:05:02.960000::Yeah.
0:05:02.960000 - 0:05:03.960000::Yeah.
0:05:03.960000 - 0:05:04.960000::Yeah.
0:05:04.960000 - 0:05:05.960000::Yeah.
0:05:05.960000 - 0:05:06.960000::Yeah.

0:05:00 - 0:05:01.640000::30 years before you think it did.
0:05:01.640000 - 0:05:04.580000::Like I think the radio was popping in like 1830s
0:05:04.580000 - 0:05:07.280000::with Napoleon and like people just thought like,
0:05:07.280000 - 0:05:09.640000::oh this, what does this fucking dumbass
0:05:09.640000 - 0:05:11.880000::like little metal box?
0:05:11.880000 - 0:05:14.120000::Like we're never, we'll never use that, you know?
0:05:14.120000 - 0:05:15.780000::And it just kind of was all like muffled like,
0:05:15.780000 - 0:05:18.080000::rrr, rrr, rrr, you can't even hear anything.
0:05:18.080000 - 0:05:19.680000::Can I blow your guys' minds?
0:05:20.920000 - 0:05:22.760000::What can I blow your minds?
0:05:22.760000 - 0:05:23.600000::You can try.
0:05:23.600000 - 0:05:27::The radio came out in 1895.
0:05:27 - 0:05:29.960000::That's when they did the fucking drop.
0:05:29.960000 - 0:05:31.240000::Limited release,
0:05:32.640000 - 0:05:34.600000::Supreme style drop of the radio.
0:05:34.600000 - 0:05:36.400000::Good, the adventure was named
0:05:36.400000 - 0:05:41.400000::Gugli, Gugli Limmo, Macaroni, Macaroni, Maconi.
0:05:42.320000 - 0:05:43.680000::Italian.
0:05:43.680000 - 0:05:44.520000::Interesting.
0:05:44.520000 - 0:05:46.320000::How could you tell?
0:05:48.200000 - 0:05:50.120000::First in that now, first movie.
0:05:52.040000 - 0:05:53.760000::1903.
0:05:53.760000 - 0:05:56.120000::Oh, 19, fucking 11.
0:05:56.120000 - 0:05:58.680000::The first movie was 1888.
0:05:58.680000 - 0:06:03.080000::So frankly, movies are older than radios.
0:06:03.080000 - 0:06:04.080000::Bullshit.
0:06:04.080000 - 0:06:05.280000::Get the fuck out there.
0:06:05.280000 - 0:06:07.040000::Does that disturb you guys?
0:06:07.040000 - 0:06:10.320000::Now, is that one rock with your sense of time again?
0:06:10.320000 - 0:06:11.160000::When?
0:06:11.160000 - 0:06:13.280000::When was the first TV show?
0:06:13.280000 - 0:06:14.440000::First TV show?
0:06:14.440000 - 0:06:15.280000::1889.
0:06:17.480000 - 0:06:18.320000::That's not true.
0:06:19.840000 - 0:06:21.680000::Hey man, don't fuck with us dude
0:06:21.680000 - 0:06:23.520000::because people who are editing Wikipedia
0:06:23.520000 - 0:06:25::come into this podcast and
0:06:25.440000 - 0:06:27.680000::put out information.
0:06:27.680000 - 0:06:31.640000::It could have ripple effects beyond like, like, like, we know.
0:06:33.240000 - 0:06:34.840000::Should have been the shortest episode yet.
0:06:34.840000 - 0:06:37.160000::We stop it at seven minutes and don't ever address it.
0:06:37.160000 - 0:06:39.560000::Oh, no, what gave you joy this week, man?
0:06:41.160000 - 0:06:43.440000::What was the first television show?
0:06:44.920000 - 0:06:46.080000::I don't even do something.
0:06:46.080000 - 0:06:46.880000::It's a long essay.
0:06:46.880000 - 0:06:48.080000::There's no simple answer for one
0:06:48.080000 - 0:06:49.480000::the first television show was.
0:06:49.480000 - 0:06:50.640000::So.
0:06:50.640000 - 0:06:51.480000::Oh shit.
0:06:51.480000 - 0:06:52.800000::I got it for this idea.
0:06:53.800000 - 0:06:56.720000::We need to go so fucking hard on April Fool's like.
0:06:56.720000 - 0:06:57.720000::April Fool's.
0:06:57.720000 - 0:07:00.720000::We need to kill somebody who deserves it on April Fool's.
0:07:00.720000 - 0:07:01.920000::Does him.
0:07:05.200000 - 0:07:09.480000::Okay, but yeah, so TVs and movies color our lives.
0:07:09.480000 - 0:07:11.560000::We need them to distract us from the.
0:07:12.880000 - 0:07:14.400000::The fear of death.
0:07:14.400000 - 0:07:16.640000::The not knowing why we're here.
0:07:16.640000 - 0:07:18.480000::You know, they're just time fillers,
0:07:18.480000 - 0:07:20.440000::but they teach us about ourselves, don't they?
0:07:21.440000 - 0:07:24::They teach us about events as well if it's a documentary.
0:07:24 - 0:07:27.640000::But what's this is the age old question, which is better?
0:07:27.640000 - 0:07:29.480000::Right? TV or movies?
0:07:29.480000 - 0:07:34.080000::And I don't want to hear no BS about its personal choice
0:07:34.080000 - 0:07:37.240000::because there's an answer.
0:07:37.240000 - 0:07:39.360000::One of them is better.
0:07:39.360000 - 0:07:40.360000::So what do we have?
0:07:40.360000 - 0:07:41.800000::Where do you guys stand?
0:07:41.800000 - 0:07:44.600000::Jack TV versus movies, you have to pick one.
0:07:44.600000 - 0:07:46.280000::You have to pick one.
0:07:46.280000 - 0:07:47.440000::Which one of you pick in?
0:07:47.440000 - 0:07:49::Which one of you fucking gonna throw it down for?
0:07:49.920000 - 0:07:51.720000::We need to have a battle right now.
0:07:51.720000 - 0:07:52.560000::All right.
0:07:53.560000 - 0:07:56.480000::If you really want me to say it, it's movies.
0:07:56.480000 - 0:07:57.320000::It's movies.
0:07:58.240000 - 0:07:59.240000::It's my best bet.
0:07:59.240000 - 0:08:01.360000::In the air, where do you stand on this?
0:08:01.360000 - 0:08:06.360000::I stand on something tells me that you're gonna fucking say TV.
0:08:07.120000 - 0:08:08.120000::Television.
0:08:09.120000 - 0:08:13.960000::I think it might be TV, but just by a fucking hair
0:08:13.960000 - 0:08:16.720000::or half a hair's length, I'll just say that.
0:08:17.680000 - 0:08:18.520000::Okay.
0:08:19.160000 - 0:08:20::Where are you?
0:08:20 - 0:08:24::This might be my favorite sort of, this is gonna be good.
0:08:24 - 0:08:26.240000::This is how I know this is gonna be a good episode
0:08:26.240000 - 0:08:29.360000::because I'm on Team Jack movies.
0:08:29.360000 - 0:08:31.840000::Oh shit, be it in the class again.
0:08:31.840000 - 0:08:33.120000::That's like style.
0:08:33.120000 - 0:08:35.080000::Okay, you're fucking ass.
0:08:35.080000 - 0:08:37.760000::This is classic high school debate style
0:08:37.760000 - 0:08:41.360000::where the one kid is forced to argue the other opinion,
0:08:41.360000 - 0:08:43.440000::but really he just wants to be friends with the other guys
0:08:43.440000 - 0:08:46.920000::and he's intimidated by their argument to do style.
0:08:46.920000 - 0:08:49.840000::And so now it's gonna be a sad fight
0:08:49.840000 - 0:08:53.960000::where the fucking other point is all fucking hung over
0:08:53.960000 - 0:08:56.200000::and sick and you guys are fucking all juiced up
0:08:56.200000 - 0:08:59.800000::on the super soldier drugs beating the fuck out of me.
0:09:01.640000 - 0:09:04.880000::I'm gonna, you're gonna get your eyes open today actually.
0:09:04.880000 - 0:09:08.200000::No, no, no, no, not to movies man.
0:09:08.200000 - 0:09:09.520000::To what?
0:09:09.520000 - 0:09:12.520000::To a new style of debating, right?
0:09:12.520000 - 0:09:14.560000::There's an American called over here.
0:09:14.560000 - 0:09:18.840000::That's a very good idea.
0:09:18.840000 - 0:09:20.480000::And I don't know what it means, but I'm gonna do it.
0:09:20.480000 - 0:09:21.560000::I could tell you.
0:09:21.560000 - 0:09:22.400000::But man.
0:09:24.160000 - 0:09:25::Okay.
0:09:27.600000 - 0:09:28.800000::Actually tell me man.
0:09:28.800000 - 0:09:30::Oh, okay.
0:09:31.200000 - 0:09:33.600000::One kiss for every fucking sense.
0:09:37.840000 - 0:09:39.280000::All right, I was wondering what would happen
0:09:39.280000 - 0:09:40.640000::if we kept going that way.
0:09:40.640000 - 0:09:42.440000::I'll move on.
0:09:42.440000 - 0:09:46.040000::So what I'm meaning to say is we're not trying
0:09:46.040000 - 0:09:47.440000::to dominate you today.
0:09:47.440000 - 0:09:51.800000::We're trying to actually make you love us.
0:09:51.800000 - 0:09:53.160000::Okay, style of debate.
0:09:55.520000 - 0:09:57.320000::Give me some, so give me some movie.
0:09:57.320000 - 0:09:58.320000::Well, why movies?
0:09:58.320000 - 0:10:00.080000::Cause I'm an Almanne leaning.

0:10:00 - 0:10:02.080000::into my role here and say some things that I don't mean,
0:10:02.080000 - 0:10:03.520000::but it's for the sake of the argument.
0:10:03.520000 - 0:10:05.240000::Movies make me fucking sick.
0:10:05.240000 - 0:10:06.520000::The way that industry operates
0:10:06.520000 - 0:10:09.240000::and the way you pay your stars is out of control.
0:10:09.240000 - 0:10:10.960000::You guys as budgets are next level,
0:10:10.960000 - 0:10:14.240000::you're sucking yourselves off with your vanity projects
0:10:14.240000 - 0:10:15.840000::and your artistic BS.
0:10:15.840000 - 0:10:17.640000::TV is the real man's game.
0:10:17.640000 - 0:10:19.600000::This is the blue collars medium.
0:10:19.600000 - 0:10:23.680000::This is what men go home and watch with a gallon of whiskey,
0:10:23.680000 - 0:10:27.800000::a pint of beer, and a wife who don't love them no more.
0:10:27.800000 - 0:10:28.680000::You know what I'm saying?
0:10:28.680000 - 0:10:30.560000::You guys have the BS.
0:10:31.560000 - 0:10:32.400000::It's all my stuff.
0:10:32.400000 - 0:10:35::I know you said that you're gonna fit a little for the thing,
0:10:35 - 0:10:36.800000::but I think a lot of people who make movies are watching
0:10:36.800000 - 0:10:38.240000::and I would just be a little, you know,
0:10:38.240000 - 0:10:39.400000::turn it down a little.
0:10:39.400000 - 0:10:40.880000::Okay, to those who are watching,
0:10:40.880000 - 0:10:44.280000::I have some script ideas, I have some short films,
0:10:44.280000 - 0:10:47.120000::but many long-ass, three hour, four hour long movies
0:10:47.120000 - 0:10:48.360000::I'd love to make.
0:10:48.360000 - 0:10:49.200000::But go ahead.
0:10:49.200000 - 0:10:50.040000::And those will be short in a couple years.
0:10:50.040000 - 0:10:52.680000::All right, so let me say this about movies, man.
0:10:52.680000 - 0:10:53.680000::This is the thing.
0:10:54.680000 - 0:10:59.680000::A movie draws you in for a movie.
0:10:59.680000 - 0:11:02.680000::I just got the feeling that this is the worst podcast ever made.
0:11:02.680000 - 0:11:04.680000::A...
0:11:06.680000 - 0:11:07.680000::Let's do it.
0:11:07.680000 - 0:11:08.680000::Let's fuck it.
0:11:08.680000 - 0:11:09.680000::Let's just go in.
0:11:09.680000 - 0:11:13.680000::Let's make the absolute worst podcast that's ever been done.
0:11:13.680000 - 0:11:14.680000::Ever been done.
0:11:14.680000 - 0:11:15.680000::Ever been done.
0:11:15.680000 - 0:11:16.680000::I'm sorry.
0:11:16.680000 - 0:11:17.680000::Interrupted.
0:11:17.680000 - 0:11:18.680000::I know you were on a good train of thought, Jack.
0:11:18.680000 - 0:11:19.680000::Go ahead.
0:11:19.680000 - 0:11:20.680000::A movie is what?
0:11:21.680000 - 0:11:23.680000::Well, you're about to look like a fool
0:11:23.680000 - 0:11:25.680000::because I'm going to drop one of my phrases.
0:11:25.680000 - 0:11:26.680000::Okay.
0:11:26.680000 - 0:11:31.680000::A movie has responsibility.
0:11:31.680000 - 0:11:34.680000::A TV show.
0:11:34.680000 - 0:11:39.680000::All they're trying to do is addict you like heroin,
0:11:39.680000 - 0:11:42.680000::like a McDonald's sugary patty, right?
0:11:42.680000 - 0:11:43.680000::But...
0:11:43.680000 - 0:11:46.680000::A McDonald's sugary patty?
0:11:46.680000 - 0:11:47.680000::Yeah, but a movie.
0:11:47.680000 - 0:11:52.680000::They send you back into the world,
0:11:52.680000 - 0:11:56.680000::fully taking the responsibility of your point of view
0:11:56.680000 - 0:12:02.680000::and your attitude and your mood when they send you back it out there.
0:12:02.680000 - 0:12:04.680000::They're not just trying to addict you.
0:12:04.680000 - 0:12:05.680000::They're trying to tell a story.
0:12:05.680000 - 0:12:06.680000::It's very human.
0:12:06.680000 - 0:12:09.680000::And it can reach an intensity that you can't live in forever.
0:12:09.680000 - 0:12:12.680000::It's kind of like, do you want to burn hot and live short?
0:12:12.680000 - 0:12:16.680000::Or do you want to live forever and just have it be less than that?
0:12:16.680000 - 0:12:18.680000::Less intense.
0:12:18.680000 - 0:12:19.680000::No, man.
0:12:19.680000 - 0:12:20.680000::I want to see that shit.
0:12:20.680000 - 0:12:23.680000::I want to see life and death.
0:12:23.680000 - 0:12:25.680000::Look at the tree of life.
0:12:25.680000 - 0:12:27.680000::You could not...
0:12:27.680000 - 0:12:29.680000::Oh, here's the thing.
0:12:29.680000 - 0:12:31.680000::And sorry, but you could not...
0:12:31.680000 - 0:12:33.680000::You could do in a TV show,
0:12:33.680000 - 0:12:34.680000::what you can do in a movie.
0:12:34.680000 - 0:12:35.680000::You could not do in a movie,
0:12:35.680000 - 0:12:36.680000::what you can do in a TV show.
0:12:36.680000 - 0:12:38.680000::Maybe you can.
0:12:38.680000 - 0:12:44.680000::Some would say that that's all that TV is.
0:12:44.680000 - 0:12:46.680000::No, it's like right now.
0:12:46.680000 - 0:12:47.680000::Yeah, totally.
0:12:47.680000 - 0:12:48.680000::Can we switch the episode?
0:12:48.680000 - 0:12:49.680000::Robert...
0:12:49.680000 - 0:12:51.680000::We asked you what you want to talk about.
0:12:51.680000 - 0:12:52.680000::Candy?
0:12:52.680000 - 0:12:53.680000::Candy.
0:12:53.680000 - 0:12:55.680000::Yeah, that sounds fun.
0:12:55.680000 - 0:12:57.680000::Why does that sound fun to me?
0:12:57.680000 - 0:13:00.680000::Well, let me sit into the...
0:13:00.680000 - 0:13:04.680000::I've been eating more candy recently, but yeah, go ahead and eat.
0:13:04.680000 - 0:13:06.680000::What would you rather watch?
0:13:06.680000 - 0:13:10.680000::Michael Scott in the office on TV.
0:13:10.680000 - 0:13:15.680000::He's just going through these sort of miniscule problems
0:13:15.680000 - 0:13:19.680000::and everyone in the office is kind of, you know,
0:13:19.680000 - 0:13:21.680000::mad at him and then they love him.
0:13:21.680000 - 0:13:24.680000::And then, you know, there's not a lot happening, all right,
0:13:24.680000 - 0:13:26.680000::in the TV show, the office.
0:13:26.680000 - 0:13:29.680000::Or what if the office was a movie?
0:13:29.680000 - 0:13:34.680000::And what if Michael Scott fucking killed Jan or something like that?
0:13:34.680000 - 0:13:37.680000::Oh, he's got to hide the body in the basement with...
0:13:37.680000 - 0:13:43.680000::Oh, with the warehouse people, all right?
0:13:43.680000 - 0:13:47.680000::And Jim is...
0:13:47.680000 - 0:13:50.680000::That's his mom, his jam.
0:13:50.680000 - 0:13:55.680000::So he's got to fucking take out Michael Scott and an epic sort of...
0:13:55.680000 - 0:13:59.680000::in the park in the lot.
0:13:59.680000 - 0:14:01.680000::And they have some epic battle.
0:14:01.680000 - 0:14:04.680000::Michael Scott says, I don't even want to live with myself anymore.
0:14:04.680000 - 0:14:07.680000::I'm just going to put myself in the head and that's the fucking credits.
0:14:07.680000 - 0:14:10.680000::Greg Daniels directed, written by...
0:14:10.680000 - 0:14:11.680000::Yeah, man.
0:14:11.680000 - 0:14:13.680000::Which one do you want to see?
0:14:13.680000 - 0:14:16.680000::I would rather see the classic TV show, the office,
0:14:16.680000 - 0:14:18.680000::that I fall in and fall with.
0:14:18.680000 - 0:14:21.680000::Personally, if I'm going to answer that, obviously.
0:14:21.680000 - 0:14:23.680000::Well, flip it the other way.
0:14:23.680000 - 0:14:26.680000::What if the movie 7 was a TV show?
0:14:26.680000 - 0:14:28.680000::And you got...
0:14:28.680000 - 0:14:29.680000::Oh, Brad Pitt.
0:14:29.680000 - 0:14:32.680000::Brad Pitt plays, I actually can't remember this movie,
0:14:32.680000 - 0:14:35.680000::but somebody dies in a plate of spaghetti.
0:14:35.680000 - 0:14:38.680000::Eric, are you checking Instagram?
0:14:38.680000 - 0:14:40.680000::No, I'm looking up a...
0:14:40.680000 - 0:14:43.680000::You remember that movie Come and See?
0:14:43.680000 - 0:14:44.680000::Hell no.
0:14:44.680000 - 0:14:46.680000::Can we ever see this movie, Nate?
0:14:46.680000 - 0:14:49.680000::Nate, you've never seen Come and See?
0:14:49.680000 - 0:14:51.680000::No.
0:14:51.680000 - 0:14:54.680000::This is the most fucked up movie of all time.
0:14:54.680000 - 0:14:55.680000::This is a war drama.
0:14:55.680000 - 0:14:58.680000::This is a war drama.
0:14:58.680000 - 0:14:59.680000::It's about it.

0:15:00 - 0:15:02::I'm not gonna get into it, but I'm just,
0:15:02 - 0:15:05::I was thinking of a Michael Scott in a come and see type movie.
0:15:05 - 0:15:07::If anybody listening has seen this movie,
0:15:07 - 0:15:10::imagining Michael Scott being that little kid running around
0:15:10 - 0:15:12::getting all effed up by war.
0:15:12 - 0:15:14::It seems Russian.
0:15:14 - 0:15:16::Maybe it is Russian.
0:15:18 - 0:15:19::Something like that.
0:15:19 - 0:15:21::Come and see.
0:15:21 - 0:15:23::Top movies of all time right now.
0:15:23 - 0:15:26::You have two seconds to name your top five favorite movies.

0:15:48 - 0:15:53::Mine was Star Wars Episode One.
0:15:53 - 0:15:55::Some would say the worst Star Wars movie.
0:15:55 - 0:15:57::I think it's a minute.
0:15:57 - 0:15:59::I think it's a minute.
0:15:59 - 0:16:01::Unanimously everyone hates that movie.
0:16:01 - 0:16:02::But guess what?
0:16:02 - 0:16:07::I was fucking seven years old or something when that came out.
0:16:07 - 0:16:09::And those movies are meant for children.
0:16:09 - 0:16:10::Alright.
0:16:10 - 0:16:12::And if you're a child and you're watching that shit,
0:16:12 - 0:16:16::that's pretty much the most epic fucking thing you get ever seen in your life.
0:16:16 - 0:16:18::And I remember I was in the fucking front row of the movie too,
0:16:18 - 0:16:19::which I hate being.
0:16:19 - 0:16:20::Yeah.
0:16:20 - 0:16:23::And I loved the fucking shit.
0:16:23 - 0:16:25::That was probably my favorite movie I've ever seen in my life.
0:16:25 - 0:16:28::Well, they did, by the way, I'll give it up to the Lucasfilm team.
0:16:28 - 0:16:30::They did the marketing right on that shit.
0:16:30 - 0:16:32::Because are you kidding me?
0:16:32 - 0:16:34::The Darth Maul toys.
0:16:34 - 0:16:36::The fucking sodas.
0:16:36 - 0:16:38::The fucking Darth Maul all over the Doritos.
0:16:38 - 0:16:41::Darth Maul was the best marketing fucking thing they've ever had.
0:16:41 - 0:16:42::You know what I'm saying?
0:16:42 - 0:16:44::The Pod Racing Games.
0:16:44 - 0:16:46::I was in love with that A-Bers.
0:16:46 - 0:16:51::Yeah, they put their whole fucking...
0:16:51 - 0:16:53::Natalie Portman, when I was whatever,
0:16:53 - 0:16:56::whatever, six years old watching that.
0:16:56 - 0:16:58::Who is she in Crash Alert?
0:16:58 - 0:17:00::That's Padme, dude.
0:17:00 - 0:17:01::So...
0:17:01 - 0:17:02::Don't play it.
0:17:02 - 0:17:03::No, no, no.
0:17:03 - 0:17:04::You said that.
0:17:04 - 0:17:05::No, come to play.
0:17:05 - 0:17:06::Is that Leia?
0:17:06 - 0:17:07::No, it's not Leia.
0:17:07 - 0:17:09::That's Leia's mom.
0:17:09 - 0:17:11::Padme.
0:17:11 - 0:17:12::Lakshmi?
0:17:12 - 0:17:14::No, it's not Padme.
0:17:14 - 0:17:16::Lakshmi is Padme.
0:17:16 - 0:17:18::All right.
0:17:18 - 0:17:20::You could see my similarity.
0:17:20 - 0:17:23::I think I woke up on the wrong side of the bed.
0:17:23 - 0:17:25::Are you not that good today?
0:17:25 - 0:17:30::You know, this might be the first time I'm in a bad mood on this podcast.
0:17:30 - 0:17:34::Well, it's not a fucking hell thing, man.
0:17:34 - 0:17:35::I don't know what...
0:17:35 - 0:17:36::Should we...
0:17:36 - 0:17:38::Do you want us to sing you a song or like...
0:17:38 - 0:17:39::I don't.
0:17:39 - 0:17:40::Because people...
0:17:40 - 0:17:41::People listening want you to be happy.
0:17:41 - 0:17:43::We want you to be happy in a good mood, rather.
0:17:43 - 0:17:45::I don't give a fuck.
0:17:45 - 0:17:46::All right, then.
0:17:46 - 0:17:49::Well, if that's what you're gonna act.
0:17:49 - 0:17:50::Losing it.
0:17:50 - 0:17:51::Losing...
0:17:51 - 0:17:52::Losing track.
0:17:52 - 0:18:00.600000::Okay, so Nate, you gave some joking answers, but really, dude, what movies are on your top?
0:18:00.600000 - 0:18:01.600000::You know what?
0:18:01.600000 - 0:18:09::I know this is a fucking cop out just saying this, but I really do hate giving like top ten
0:18:09 - 0:18:10::like lists.
0:18:10 - 0:18:13.680000::Okay, so there's a friend that's sick in bed.
0:18:13.680000 - 0:18:16.920000::They're fucking bedridden and it could be something really bad.
0:18:16.920000 - 0:18:20.080000::They don't know, but they're waiting for the test and they want to distract themselves
0:18:20.080000 - 0:18:21.480000::with some fun movies.
0:18:21.480000 - 0:18:22.480000::See, this is...
0:18:22.480000 - 0:18:23.480000::I like this.
0:18:23.480000 - 0:18:24.480000::This is a good...
0:18:24.480000 - 0:18:28.480000::What are some movies you give to them for them to watch while they're all sick and fucking
0:18:28.480000 - 0:18:29.800000::scared?
0:18:29.800000 - 0:18:30.800000::You know what?
0:18:30.800000 - 0:18:31.800000::I feel like...
0:18:31.800000 - 0:18:33.800000::Okay, no, I would say...
0:18:33.800000 - 0:18:34.800000::You know what comes to mind?
0:18:34.800000 - 0:18:35.800000::American movie.
0:18:35.800000 - 0:18:36.800000::That's one of...
0:18:36.800000 - 0:18:37.800000::Bro, that's always...
0:18:37.800000 - 0:18:38.800000::I am a wreck.
0:18:38.800000 - 0:18:39.800000::Oh, my God.
0:18:39.800000 - 0:18:45.240000::Whenever I watch that, it just is always...
0:18:45.240000 - 0:18:46.720000::Always incredible.
0:18:46.760000 - 0:18:48.360000::Like, it's so...
0:18:48.360000 - 0:18:52.060000::It's one of the funniest movies for me forever.
0:18:52.060000 - 0:18:54::It was in Chicago and...
0:18:54 - 0:18:55::I think it was with us.
0:18:55 - 0:18:57.840000::It was just like crying laughing, was it?
0:18:57.840000 - 0:19:04.160000::Because a member after James died and we were all at our house, and we were all just
0:19:04.160000 - 0:19:08.360000::kind of grieving for a long time, that was the first time I ever saw that movie, too,
0:19:08.360000 - 0:19:09.760000::and that's the hardest I've laughed.
0:19:09.760000 - 0:19:10.760000::Yeah.
0:19:10.760000 - 0:19:11.760000::In my lap.
0:19:11.760000 - 0:19:14.080000::Everyone he's put in the head through the door?
0:19:14.080000 - 0:19:15.080000::Yeah, that's always great.
0:19:15.080000 - 0:19:17.120000::The cabinet is putting that through the cabinet.
0:19:17.120000 - 0:19:20.080000::That is like the funniest moment that's ever captured.
0:19:20.080000 - 0:19:22.840000::It is, it's for a local actor.
0:19:22.840000 - 0:19:24.160000::If you have not seen this movie,
0:19:24.160000 - 0:19:26.400000::I really hope and I pray to God
0:19:26.400000 - 0:19:28.720000::that there are hundreds of people out there
0:19:28.720000 - 0:19:30.440000::who have not seen American movie.
0:19:30.440000 - 0:19:35.440000::It's like a documentary about a local Wisconsin filmmaker
0:19:36.120000 - 0:19:41.120000::who's like trying to make his like a film.
0:19:41.120000 - 0:19:44.720000::And it's just everything that I love
0:19:45.440000 - 0:19:48::think that is funny about a person is like
0:19:48 - 0:19:50.760000::right as to what's his name Mark.
0:19:50.760000 - 0:19:55.480000::Mark, um, Mark Bloody Bortert.
0:19:55.480000 - 0:19:56.800000::And you know, I met his daughter.
0:19:56.800000 - 0:19:59.720000::I met Mark's daughter at a film festival.
0:19:59.720000 - 0:20:00.720000::She's like,

0:20:00 - 0:20:03::like organizer of film festivals now.
0:20:03 - 0:20:04.040000::Oh, I love that.
0:20:04.040000 - 0:20:04.880000::That's awesome.
0:20:04.880000 - 0:20:06.040000::And Russ and P's too.
0:20:06.040000 - 0:20:07.280000::What's his name?
0:20:07.280000 - 0:20:08.640000::Oh, yes.
0:20:08.640000 - 0:20:12.720000::Poor Mike Shank passed away early like last year, I think.
0:20:12.720000 - 0:20:15.240000::Man, are I fucking pee, dude?
0:20:15.240000 - 0:20:17.040000::God, Mike Shank.
0:20:17.040000 - 0:20:20.440000::We all need a Mike Shank in this life.
0:20:20.440000 - 0:20:22.040000::Yes.
0:20:22.040000 - 0:20:22.560000::Absolutely.
0:20:22.560000 - 0:20:24.720000::Have you seen it, Jack?
0:20:24.720000 - 0:20:25.840000::We watch it.
0:20:25.840000 - 0:20:28.440000::Oh.
0:20:28.440000 - 0:20:31.720000::There's a feedback.
0:20:31.720000 - 0:20:32.720000::Check.
0:20:32.720000 - 0:20:34.720000::What happened?
0:20:34.720000 - 0:20:40.400000::Just got a crazy echo.
0:20:40.400000 - 0:20:41.400000::That was nuts.
0:20:41.400000 - 0:20:42.240000::I heard that.
0:20:42.240000 - 0:20:44.280000::That's Mike Shank's ghost.
0:20:44.280000 - 0:20:46.360000::Wow.
0:20:46.360000 - 0:20:47.920000::We watch it in bedstie one time.
0:20:47.920000 - 0:20:53.400000::I came from, I can't remember much except for like a dumpster or something.
0:20:53.400000 - 0:20:56.160000::OK, now I'm going to flip that to you.
0:20:56.160000 - 0:20:59.160000::Eric with TV.
0:20:59.160000 - 0:21:05.640000::A sickly dying person is, and they just want to experience some sort of relief and pain.
0:21:05.640000 - 0:21:09.160000::And they're in the worst stage of whatever illness they have.
0:21:09.160000 - 0:21:11.280000::And it is just wrecking themselves.
0:21:11.280000 - 0:21:16::But at night time, it kind of wears off where they can pay attention to something.
0:21:16 - 0:21:24.960000::And they just need this 25 to an hour long period to just zone out and just enjoy and
0:21:24.960000 - 0:21:25.960000::forget.
0:21:25.960000 - 0:21:26.960000::What do you think?
0:21:26.960000 - 0:21:29.360000::The biggest belly last I ever get from a show.
0:21:29.360000 - 0:21:32.040000::And OK, and I think it's Peep Show.
0:21:32.040000 - 0:21:33.040000::I think it's Peep Show.
0:21:33.040000 - 0:21:34.040000::The bridge.
0:21:34.040000 - 0:21:35.040000::Oh, Peep Show.
0:21:35.040000 - 0:21:36.040000::sitcom Peep Show.
0:21:36.040000 - 0:21:40.040000::It's the four, you know, it's just so far.
0:21:40.040000 - 0:21:42.400000::I really watch a little bit of that.
0:21:42.400000 - 0:21:43.400000::Are you kidding me, Nick?
0:21:43.400000 - 0:21:45.400000::Oh, long, long time ago.
0:21:45.400000 - 0:21:47.880000::That makes me want to dip back in.
0:21:47.880000 - 0:21:48.880000::Go back to college.
0:21:48.880000 - 0:21:53.160000::It's the, it's just the fucking funniest thing on the planet.
0:21:53.160000 - 0:21:55.880000::You know, they try to make an American version of it.
0:21:55.880000 - 0:21:59.680000::And the pilot's on YouTube and it's so busted.
0:21:59.680000 - 0:22:02.280000::Why is it that American?
0:22:02.280000 - 0:22:05.520000::Is it just the accents of the British or is it their sensibility?
0:22:05.520000 - 0:22:09.800000::I'm trying to figure out why a British person being funny to me is a million times more
0:22:09.800000 - 0:22:11.600000::funny than an American person.
0:22:11.600000 - 0:22:12.600000::Why is that?
0:22:12.600000 - 0:22:13.600000::Well, you know what it is.
0:22:13.600000 - 0:22:14.600000::I have a theory.
0:22:14.600000 - 0:22:15.600000::What?
0:22:15.600000 - 0:22:18.760000::And I'm going to get political to say it now.
0:22:18.760000 - 0:22:23.600000::I think somebody described this on, I don't know.
0:22:23.600000 - 0:22:30.920000::I'm like repeating an opinion of somebody else's, but the UK has a much better like unemployment
0:22:30.920000 - 0:22:31.920000::system.
0:22:31.920000 - 0:22:35.960000::Like if you're unemployed, you can get like, I don't know.
0:22:35.960000 - 0:22:38.520000::Like it's all, I think the money's like there.
0:22:38.520000 - 0:22:42.680000::If you don't have a job, basically, like you can get a stipend.
0:22:42.680000 - 0:22:48.840000::So there's like a lot of artists when they're, it's something to do with like if you're
0:22:48.840000 - 0:22:53.560000::unemployed, you have more time to like focus on whatever you're working on.
0:22:53.560000 - 0:22:54.560000::Yeah.
0:22:54.560000 - 0:22:58.360000::So that was like a theory somebody posted up.
0:22:58.360000 - 0:23:04.920000::Well, I think also the BBC is like government, you know, a lot of these comedy damn ass shows
0:23:04.920000 - 0:23:06.600000::are government funded, dude.
0:23:06.600000 - 0:23:07.600000::BBC government funded.
0:23:07.600000 - 0:23:08.600000::Right.
0:23:08.600000 - 0:23:12.920000::So you don't have to be some rich frickin' megalomaniac to get a frickin' TV show.
0:23:12.920000 - 0:23:13.920000::That's right.
0:23:13.920000 - 0:23:14.920000::That's right.
0:23:14.920000 - 0:23:23.160000::I may also add in terms of these adaptations, I think people are so odd to think that it's
0:23:23.680000 - 0:23:25.640000::not about the individual.
0:23:25.640000 - 0:23:31.800000::Like you can just take the concept of a show and just put the premise in the hands of
0:23:31.800000 - 0:23:35.560000::some other people like they're not going to inherently they're not going to be able to
0:23:35.560000 - 0:23:39.120000::execute it unless the people whose sensibility are behind it anyways.
0:23:39.120000 - 0:23:42.360000::They could study it and they can get pretty close or they could reinvent it and make something
0:23:42.360000 - 0:23:47.120000::new if they look out and get some like talented people who would have made an otherwise
0:23:47.120000 - 0:23:48.720000::hilarious show.
0:23:48.720000 - 0:23:51.880000::Even if it wasn't that premise, you know what I'm saying?
0:23:51.880000 - 0:23:57.800000::But it's a bit odd, I don't know, it's a bit pathetic to me to be honest, to watch
0:23:57.800000 - 0:24:05.280000::people like just taking something successful and not, you know, not having the ability
0:24:05.280000 - 0:24:08.920000::to be a taste maker and let some people make some new shit.
0:24:08.920000 - 0:24:09.920000::Right.
0:24:09.920000 - 0:24:13.560000::But I will say this and I hate that I'm even uttering this sentence on our podcast,
0:24:13.560000 - 0:24:14.560000::but...
0:24:14.560000 - 0:24:15.560000::I did it, but...
0:24:15.560000 - 0:24:16.560000::That's the go.
0:24:16.560000 - 0:24:17.560000::That's the go.
0:24:17.560000 - 0:24:18.560000::Are you kidding me?
0:24:18.560000 - 0:24:19.560000::Hey, sir.
0:24:19.560000 - 0:24:20.560000::Let's talk about candy.
0:24:20.560000 - 0:24:21.560000::Let's talk about candy.
0:24:21.560000 - 0:24:25.400000::We gotta say a couple more things about movies and TV.
0:24:25.400000 - 0:24:26.400000::Come on now.
0:24:26.400000 - 0:24:29.720000::A couple more things about movies and TV.
0:24:29.720000 - 0:24:30.720000::Come on.
0:24:30.720000 - 0:24:33.760000::What is your recommendation for a movie or TV show?
0:24:33.760000 - 0:24:34.760000::Or TV show?
0:24:34.760000 - 0:24:37.840000::For a sickly friend?
0:24:37.840000 - 0:24:39.440000::Well, I've got a few.
0:24:39.440000 - 0:24:40.440000::Sickly patron.
0:24:40.440000 - 0:24:41.440000::A patron.

0:27:24.400000 - 0:27:28.280000::And laughing in the face of pain and danger, right?

0:28:23.440000 - 0:28:27.400000::Paul Walker has been burned to death in a Porsche.
0:28:27.400000 - 0:28:29.560000::He might have been smushed and then burned.
0:28:29.560000 - 0:28:30.560000::Let's pray.
0:28:30.560000 - 0:28:32.880000::That was a that was a violent death.

0:28:33.920000 - 0:28:36.400000::I think they showed the bodies.
0:28:36.400000 - 0:28:37.400000::No.
0:28:37.400000 - 0:28:38.200000::They look like that.
0:28:38.200000 - 0:28:39.800000::Well, I'm not going to say that.
0:28:39.800000 - 0:28:40.960000::OK.
0:28:40.960000 - 0:28:47::Do you think there could be a really, because we're, you know, we're coming up with some
0:28:47 - 0:28:48::movie ideas.

0:29:17.180000 - 0:29:22.060000::Why do I think that would make millions upon millions tens of a hundred million dollars
0:29:22.060000 - 0:29:23.820000::in the box office?
0:29:23.820000 - 0:29:27.700000::American's appetite for parody has gone down the drain when reality started being more
0:29:27.700000 - 0:29:31.500000::a paradoxical than even the movies.
0:29:31.500000 - 0:29:34.700000::You know, I'm saying, is that what parody comes from paradoxical?
0:29:34.700000 - 0:29:38.660000::I'm sure there's some sort of some connect.

0:34:53.520000 - 0:34:55.520000::Modica likes oh
0:34:55.520000 - 0:34:59.520000::I'm sure she she is amazing. She was like you oh no no

0:35:00 - 0:35:01.940000::I'm missing out this is.
0:35:03.320000 - 0:35:08.320000::It's Matt Damon pretending to be somebody else
0:35:08.360000 - 0:35:10.120000::and living amongst the ribs.
0:35:10.120000 - 0:35:11.120000::Mr. Ripley?
0:35:11.120000 - 0:35:13.600000::No, you know who recommended this to me?
0:35:13.600000 - 0:35:15.880000::I think is Rachel.
0:35:15.880000 - 0:35:16.720000::Collie?
0:35:16.720000 - 0:35:17.560000::Yeah.
0:35:17.560000 - 0:35:18.720000::That makes sense.
0:35:18.720000 - 0:35:19.880000::Amazing taste as well.
0:35:19.880000 - 0:35:21.840000::Yeah, it makes total sense.
0:35:21.840000 - 0:35:25.480000::It's just hidden and it's yeah, Joodla.
0:35:25.480000 - 0:35:28.080000::Joodla, sexy as all fuck.
0:35:29.040000 - 0:35:31.240000::That's how a man should look.
0:35:31.240000 - 0:35:32.680000::I'm never going to look that way.
0:35:32.680000 - 0:35:34.560000::I'm an ectomorph.
0:35:34.560000 - 0:35:37.360000::What do you call it endomorph?
0:35:37.360000 - 0:35:40.040000::I'm on the different side of the morph scale,
0:35:40.040000 - 0:35:42.280000::but Joodla, snap.
0:35:42.280000 - 0:35:44::He can get it in that movie.
0:35:45.760000 - 0:35:47.240000::I'll just say it like that.
0:35:49 - 0:35:52.200000::So what am I going to pick for my drama?
0:35:52.200000 - 0:35:54.360000::My hard hitting drama?
0:35:54.360000 - 0:35:57.360000::Well, I'm going to put you on to something rare.
0:35:59.080000 - 0:36:01.320000::You know Dennis Quaid.
0:36:01.320000 - 0:36:02.560000::The rookie.
0:36:02.560000 - 0:36:05.840000::Did you well, did you know that he's capable of drama as well?
0:36:07.080000 - 0:36:08.080000::Parent trap.
0:36:08.080000 - 0:36:09.160000::What is it?
0:36:09.160000 - 0:36:12.600000::This is a rare, interesting concept.
0:36:12.600000 - 0:36:16.360000::The movie is called Enemy Mine.
0:36:17.440000 - 0:36:18.480000::Heard of it.
0:36:18.480000 - 0:36:20.040000::The alien.
0:36:20.040000 - 0:36:23.800000::This is a movie where Dennis Quaid and an alien
0:36:23.800000 - 0:36:25.560000::are an intergalactic space war.
0:36:25.680000 - 0:36:28.880000::They both crash land on a foreign planet.
0:36:28.880000 - 0:36:31.560000::And they have to learn to survive.
0:36:31.560000 - 0:36:35.720000::And I'll just, I fucking want to give a spoiler so bad
0:36:35.720000 - 0:36:38.360000::because I don't think anyone's going to watch it.
0:36:38.360000 - 0:36:41.120000::But spoiler alert.
0:36:41.120000 - 0:36:42.320000::Spoiler alert.
0:36:42.320000 - 0:36:43.440000::Say it.
0:36:43.440000 - 0:36:46.600000::They hook up.
0:36:46.600000 - 0:36:50.160000::Have, well, the alien has a baby.
0:36:50.160000 - 0:36:52.560000::And they raise the alien baby together.
0:36:52.560000 - 0:36:54.920000::And they raise the alien a girl.
0:36:54.920000 - 0:36:57.840000::Well, I don't know if they do it like that with the sexes.
0:36:57.840000 - 0:37:02.520000::But apparently, basically, this is a full drama
0:37:02.520000 - 0:37:06::where two people do not speak the same language at all.
0:37:06 - 0:37:07::Wow.
0:37:07 - 0:37:10.760000::And it's a whole fucking movie where Dennis Quaid is like,
0:37:10.760000 - 0:37:12.360000::you must run out of it.
0:37:12.360000 - 0:37:17.360000::Like full level 10 emotional acting in the most absurd
0:37:17.360000 - 0:37:20.120000::circumstance where it's like, I can't believe it.
0:37:20.120000 - 0:37:21.400000::Oh my god, it's so beautiful.
0:37:21.400000 - 0:37:23.640000::Your child is gorgeous.
0:37:23.640000 - 0:37:28.280000::And then the alien goes, I'm not gonna lie.
0:37:28.280000 - 0:37:33.360000::The fact that it's not a comedy is so unreal.
0:37:33.360000 - 0:37:36.520000::It is like the most like, when you forget what you're watching
0:37:36.520000 - 0:37:38.240000::and you're just lost in the emotion of the scene
0:37:38.240000 - 0:37:42.640000::and then you hear the alien again, you're like, what the fucking hell?
0:37:42.640000 - 0:37:43.560000::Where am I?
0:37:43.560000 - 0:37:45.280000::Do you know there's an episode of Star Trek,
0:37:45.280000 - 0:37:48.840000::the next generation that is a bit similar?
0:37:48.840000 - 0:37:52.440000::And the episode is titled Darmak at Tenagra.
0:37:52.440000 - 0:37:53.760000::When did it come out?
0:37:53.760000 - 0:37:55.040000::1990.
0:37:57.920000 - 0:37:58.920000::After.
0:37:58.920000 - 0:38:00.200000::Enemy mind is 85.
0:38:01.200000 - 0:38:02.680000::Oh shit, so it is after.
0:38:02.680000 - 0:38:03.520000::Yeah.
0:38:03.520000 - 0:38:04.800000::Oh snap.
0:38:04.800000 - 0:38:09.080000::But basically, similar thing, Mr. Captain Picard
0:38:09.080000 - 0:38:11.240000::is crash landed and so was an alien on this planet.
0:38:11.240000 - 0:38:12.360000::They don't speak the same language,
0:38:12.360000 - 0:38:13.200000::but they have to survive.
0:38:13.200000 - 0:38:14.640000::They stole the motherfucking movie.
0:38:14.640000 - 0:38:15.480000::Wow.
0:38:15.480000 - 0:38:20.240000::And basically, this alien can only say Darmak at Tenagra.
0:38:20.240000 - 0:38:22.200000::The train's light is broken, but that's all they can say.
0:38:22.200000 - 0:38:24.080000::And so they're learning to communicate.
0:38:24.080000 - 0:38:26.560000::As it turns out, this alien civilization
0:38:26.560000 - 0:38:27.560000::doesn't speak in sentences.
0:38:27.560000 - 0:38:29.200000::They speak in events.
0:38:29.200000 - 0:38:32.400000::So that he's mentioning an old historical event
0:38:32.400000 - 0:38:34.800000::where something happened in an old ancient battle
0:38:34.800000 - 0:38:35.720000::and that's what they need to do.
0:38:35.720000 - 0:38:39::So yeah, everybody was in that direction.
0:38:39 - 0:38:41.480000::But you're not getting in that fucking the Star Trek TV show
0:38:41.480000 - 0:38:42.360000::Writer's Room.
0:38:42.360000 - 0:38:43.800000::How much fun would that be?
0:38:43.800000 - 0:38:48.120000::Oh, I bet that was actually high charge, sexually charged.
0:38:48.120000 - 0:38:48.640000::You know what I'm saying?
0:38:48.640000 - 0:38:51.400000::All them sexy nerdy beasts.
0:38:52.200000 - 0:38:56.800000::Getting there, chemicals all percolating.
0:38:56.800000 - 0:38:58.320000::Can you imagine being one of these aliens?
0:38:58.320000 - 0:39:01.200000::The actors playing the alien in the suit in the 80s and 90s
0:39:01.200000 - 0:39:05.200000::when it was just having prosthetics sweating full panic attacks.
0:39:05.200000 - 0:39:06.040000::Yeah, you died.
0:39:06.040000 - 0:39:07.880000::I think you should leave style.
0:39:07.880000 - 0:39:08.560000::Type of pain.
0:39:11.560000 - 0:39:14.040000::Can I ask you guys about the movie Lost in Translation?
0:39:14.040000 - 0:39:15.800000::Of course, you can ask about it.
0:39:15.800000 - 0:39:16.720000::What do you want to know?
0:39:16.720000 - 0:39:18.440000::So I just recently watched this.
0:39:18.440000 - 0:39:21.520000::And you're telling me that they filmed it in Japan.
0:39:21.520000 - 0:39:27.920000::And the lead actors were Scarlet Johansson and Bill Murray.
0:39:27.920000 - 0:39:28.440000::And Bill Murray.
0:39:28.440000 - 0:39:32.600000::So Bill Murray is, at the time of filming, approximately 51.
0:39:32.600000 - 0:39:36.040000::And she is approximately 17.
0:39:36.040000 - 0:39:37.040000::Yeah.
0:39:37.040000 - 0:39:41.600000::Share basically what's called a kiss at the end of the movie.
0:39:41.600000 - 0:39:45.240000::And it's a bit odd.
0:39:45.240000 - 0:39:46.440000::Yeah.
0:39:46.440000 - 0:39:50.760000::Well, I just have one question.
0:39:50.760000 - 0:39:52.960000::What was that?
0:39:52.960000 - 0:39:54.720000::I don't know.
0:39:54.720000 - 0:39:57.880000::So for your Copola, it sounds like you
0:39:57.880000 - 0:40:01.320000::got hit on the head with a Copola based on the ages.

0:40:00 - 0:40:03.720000::these. What's a copula? Is that cam?
0:40:03.720000 - 0:40:06.480000::Coconut. I meant like coconut.
0:40:10.240000 - 0:40:14.400000::All right. That movie couldn't be done today. The coffee that you just did, Nate,
0:40:14.400000 - 0:40:17.880000::isn't one of the most crazy. Was it a sickly one?
0:40:18.240000 - 0:40:23.160000::It was a. Yeah, it was the, it looks sickly and it just is
0:40:23.160000 - 0:40:28.320000::I can't. I've been this, I was sick probably a week ago. And the
0:40:28.320000 - 0:40:35.520000::coughs have not gotten gotten less sickly crap. Am I, we need, we need to get a
0:40:35.520000 - 0:40:39.280000::doctor to my, to my apartment, I think. I think there's something going on.
0:40:39.280000 - 0:40:43.640000::Something we need. You need like a 1800s traveling doctor with the big black
0:40:44.400000 - 0:40:49.880000::suitcase. The big black doctors bag. That's a mate. That eliminates the
0:40:49.880000 - 0:40:53.840000::ambulance, you know, on foot doctor. Yeah.
0:40:53.840000 - 0:41:00.520000::Mm hmm. Give me surgery in my bed, you know, full surgery. I'd listen to that song.
0:41:01.600000 - 0:41:04.160000::Give me surgery in my bed.
0:41:05.520000 - 0:41:07.240000::That's that's my.
0:41:08.920000 - 0:41:12.640000::Put the knife on my tummy. Make an actual surgery.
0:41:14.640000 - 0:41:17.280000::Nate, you are the sexual surgeon from what I've heard. You're stoper.
0:41:17.280000 - 0:41:23.720000::Nice with it. Like in years to be, yeah, your sexual style being called
0:41:23.720000 - 0:41:27.920000::surgical. It's scary. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Nate makes the smallest
0:41:27.920000 - 0:41:31.760000::movements on human history when he's having sex. You would never, you have a
0:41:31.760000 - 0:41:34.880000::calculator on your side, graphing calculator to figure out exactly what to
0:41:34.880000 - 0:41:39.880000::hit. Nags, how deep to go. What does that call the protractor?
0:41:40.080000 - 0:41:40.680000::Yeah.
0:41:40.920000 - 0:41:41.520000::Yeah.
0:41:42.920000 - 0:41:45.600000::You got the super, super crazy bright light overhead.
0:41:46.600000 - 0:41:50.440000::The bright light, the lightest light that has ever been in a room.
0:41:50.440000 - 0:41:53.400000::The dentist style. Yeah. The blood pressure cuff.
0:41:55.760000 - 0:41:59.840000::All right, blood pressure cuff on the dick. The blood. Is that what you're talking about?
0:41:59.840000 - 0:42:02.320000::Oh, oh, oh, squeeze it out.
0:42:02.320000 - 0:42:03.160000::Yes.
0:42:10.320000 - 0:42:11.760000::Just like running through the roller.
0:42:11.760000 - 0:42:15.760000::Your actual blood pressure. If you did that, if you put up one of the blood
0:42:15.760000 - 0:42:17.120000::pressure things on the weeny.
0:42:20.560000 - 0:42:23.080000::Yeah, it depends on the size, but yeah,
0:42:23.080000 - 0:42:25.600000::only way to find out. Yeah.
0:42:26.120000 - 0:42:28.200000::Down and down.
0:42:28.320000 - 0:42:31.480000::Dude, Jack medical Jackass. Medical Jackass.
0:42:31.480000 - 0:42:32.080000::I don't know.
0:42:32.080000 - 0:42:32.680000::No, no, no.
0:42:32.680000 - 0:42:34.160000::You watch Steve.
0:42:34.160000 - 0:42:34.960000::Was new special?
0:42:35.640000 - 0:42:38.760000::No. Well, I don't want to talk about it because he's not coming on to plug it.
0:42:38.760000 - 0:42:41.080000::So I watch Matt Rice, new special.
0:42:42.440000 - 0:42:43.520000::Did I watch it three times?
0:42:43.520000 - 0:42:44.840000::You've been a little annihilated it.
0:42:45.920000 - 0:42:46.720000::No, I didn't want to.
0:42:46.720000 - 0:42:48.760000::So you know, he's fucking crying at home.
0:42:49.760000 - 0:42:52.400000::Like he like, well, what he did?
0:42:52.400000 - 0:42:55.920000::People like that shouldn't even why are we even bother reviewing them?
0:42:56.400000 - 0:42:56.920000::You know,
0:42:58.200000 - 0:43:00.360000::I don't know. What do you mean?
0:43:00.840000 - 0:43:02.960000::Like I'm just saying, why review millionaires?
0:43:03.960000 - 0:43:05.400000::Why review Matt right?
0:43:05.400000 - 0:43:06.280000::Like who cares?
0:43:06.280000 - 0:43:07.720000::We all know who he is.
0:43:08.040000 - 0:43:10.080000::Everyone knows what's going on.
0:43:10.160000 - 0:43:14.960000::You know, we don't need a review to tell us this is why man that this is whatever.
0:43:15 - 0:43:15.640000::We get it.
0:43:15.640000 - 0:43:21.280000::We it's just so obvious that no one needs another person to dissect what they got.
0:43:21.280000 - 0:43:24.520000::No, they're putting down back in the 1910s.
0:43:24.560000 - 0:43:26.320000::Nate, there was this.
0:43:26.400000 - 0:43:31.080000::People would be want they come into fucking town and they go, oh shit, the carnivals here.
0:43:31.280000 - 0:43:37.200000::Let me go to the pick up the newspaper and see which bearded ladies that fucking best one to go shake hands with.
0:43:37.200000 - 0:43:39::Right. That's what the function was.
0:43:39.360000 - 0:43:41.960000::These days, it's all flipped turned upside down.
0:43:42.480000 - 0:43:48.480000::All the sudden we have these reporters who are trying to basically write something just to get a little bit of
0:43:48.480000 - 0:43:51.760000::the traction that this individual has already gotten for themselves.
0:43:52.440000 - 0:43:57.600000::So it's we are living in basically backwards world as far as I'm concerned when it comes to journalism.
0:43:58 - 0:43:59.920000::And I don't know what to do.
0:44:00.160000 - 0:44:00.960000::What to do about it.
0:44:03.640000 - 0:44:05.880000::Would you like to see Matt Rife and a Korean drama?
0:44:06.520000 - 0:44:07.720000::You like find that with that.
0:44:07.720000 - 0:44:11.920000::Make your respect to more if you find out he was a Korean drama superstar speaking full Korean.
0:44:13.040000 - 0:44:14.320000::Absolutely would.
0:44:14.920000 - 0:44:15.400000::Oh, wow.
0:44:15.400000 - 0:44:19.240000::I'm blown away by people who could speak multiple languages.
0:44:19.800000 - 0:44:21.480000::Polyglots.
0:44:21.480000 - 0:44:23.480000::We should have the we should have a polyglot on.
0:44:23.480000 - 0:44:25.480000::Polyglots and put the a man.
0:44:25.480000 - 0:44:26.480000::That's what you are, Jack.
0:44:27.480000 - 0:44:28.480000::Well, polyglot.
0:44:28.480000 - 0:44:29.480000::Polyglotinated.
0:44:29.480000 - 0:44:32.320000::No, no, no, no, no, no, no, not like that.
0:44:34.520000 - 0:44:36.600000::Should we get a polyglot up on here and test them?
0:44:36.600000 - 0:44:37.520000::Oh, clear.
0:44:37.520000 - 0:44:39.120000::Should we get Jiaman?
0:44:39.600000 - 0:44:42.080000::If we could get Jiaman and YC on the pot.
0:44:42.080000 - 0:44:48.400000::This is a YouTuber who goes into basically Chinatown and blows their fucking mind because he's a white boy.
0:44:50.240000 - 0:44:52.240000::And he's doing it with new languages too.
0:44:52.240000 - 0:44:53.840000::So he does, you've seen him right now.
0:44:53.840000 - 0:45:00::He does Chinese, which and he does, Matt, he does like multiple variations of Chinese and he's blowing people's mind.

0:45:00 - 0:45:07::He does banish, which is not as impressive, but then he's also been doing patois.
0:45:07 - 0:45:10::Yeah, that was not good.
0:45:10 - 0:45:15::I'm sorry, but I think that is what the YouTube video is titled.
0:45:15 - 0:45:21::He's like doing the Jamaican style and it's just like, I don't know if this is the, you know what I mean?
0:45:21 - 0:45:23::Yeah, it feels a little different.
0:45:23 - 0:45:28::But that's, and that's how you go down the rabbit hole.
0:45:28 - 0:45:34::It's interesting because you start out, you can kind of see there's little entryways into becoming radical right wing American.
0:45:34 - 0:45:36::And I feel like that is one.
0:45:36 - 0:45:40::You feel like Shama is entryway into the right wing.
0:45:40 - 0:45:43::I do feel like he's right wing.
0:45:43 - 0:45:46::I feel like anything you watch on YouTube, I don't care.
0:45:46 - 0:45:48::It could be this fucking podcast.
0:45:48 - 0:45:51::There will be one thing that is.
0:45:52 - 0:45:56::This is the boot, this is a bootage edge pipeline podcast.
0:45:56 - 0:46:01::You listen to one episode and you get fucking flooded with the bootage edge propaganda.
0:46:01 - 0:46:06::This is the pro military Democrats type shit.
0:46:06 - 0:46:14::I want to see Pete Buttigieg lose his fucking mind, have a mental breakdown on camera.
0:46:14 - 0:46:20::He would be the perfect Spider-Man villain who's taking a type of drug to stay awake for political debates,
0:46:20 - 0:46:25::and actually turns him into a fucking lizard.
0:46:25 - 0:46:28::Dr. Connors.
0:46:28 - 0:46:33::And yeah, for everybody listening, I think I said it in a previous episode,
0:46:33 - 0:46:37::but I just beat fucking Spider-Man 2 on normal mode.
0:46:37 - 0:46:38::Congratulations.
0:46:38 - 0:46:40::On the amazing Spider-Man mode.
0:46:40 - 0:46:43::That's easier than that.
0:46:43 - 0:46:47::Yes, there is, dude, and I didn't go for that.
0:46:48 - 0:46:49::I'm surprised.
0:46:49 - 0:46:53::But I did play Baldur's Gate on Easy as fuck mode, and it was still hard.
0:46:53 - 0:46:54::For me.
0:46:54 - 0:46:56::Have you guys seen Death to Smoochy?
0:46:56 - 0:46:57::Yes.
0:46:57 - 0:47:00::I didn't see that.
0:47:00 - 0:47:02::John Stuart's in it.
0:47:02 - 0:47:04::And Robin Williams?
0:47:04 - 0:47:05::Yeah.
0:47:05 - 0:47:13::May I say, it is so fucking jarring having never seen John Stuart in a narrative to be watching a movie
0:47:14 - 0:47:19::and then all of a sudden John Stuart's in the scene, and it feels like this is somebody who is such a personality that they cannot.
0:47:19 - 0:47:22::Does it feel like he's going to go Jordan Clipper on this?
0:47:22 - 0:47:23::Stuart.
0:47:23 - 0:47:26::It's just, no matter, even though he's obviously not looking into the lens,
0:47:26 - 0:47:32::it feels like he is looking into the, like the fourth wall is just nuclear bomb annihilated.
0:47:32 - 0:47:37::That's why we have to be, I'm telling you guys, capital C, careful with this podcast.
0:47:37 - 0:47:41::We wanted to actually stay at this level to where it's only, it's a niche podcast,
0:47:42 - 0:47:45::because if it blows up enough, we're not getting put in these Korean dramas.
0:47:45 - 0:47:47::We're not getting put in fucking music.
0:47:47 - 0:47:53::Well, this is the problem with our society right now, Eric, is that if it blows up that much,
0:47:53 - 0:47:55::it's almost the only way for us to do that.
0:47:55 - 0:47:56::I know.
0:47:56 - 0:48:04::And this is why the art is so fucking unenjoyable these days is you have to sell your soul in order to put your soul on the map.
0:48:04 - 0:48:05::You know what I'm saying?
0:48:06 - 0:48:11::You have to sell your soul in order to, I don't know what I'm trying to say.
0:48:12 - 0:48:13::All right.
0:48:13 - 0:48:16::Are you guys walking through life feeling like the main character?
0:48:17 - 0:48:22::Are you walking through life like Neo and everybody else is still plugged into the matrix?
0:48:22 - 0:48:23::Do you feel this sometimes?
0:48:24 - 0:48:25::Pre-pandemic.
0:48:25 - 0:48:29::Pre-pandemic, you felt like the main character and then that was robbed from you by the disease?
0:48:29 - 0:48:32::That made it abundantly clear to me that I am a statistic.
0:48:36 - 0:48:37::You're an outlier.
0:48:37 - 0:48:39::You are a statistic but you're an outlier.
0:48:39 - 0:48:42::Do you feel like the main character of your life?
0:48:42 - 0:48:43::No, I don't.
0:48:43 - 0:48:48::Because everything that you say, everything you do, every behavior that I've seen,
0:48:48 - 0:48:52::tells me that you're violently not in control of your life.
0:48:52 - 0:48:56::And you have no control over what you say, what you do, what you think, what you feel.
0:48:56 - 0:49:00::That you are trapped, that you are being...
0:49:01 - 0:49:02::You're under a crisis.
0:49:02 - 0:49:03::I'm led by God.
0:49:03 - 0:49:06::You're right about that but it's God doing everything.
0:49:07 - 0:49:08::That's God shining through me.
0:49:09 - 0:49:10::Shining is light.
0:49:10 - 0:49:13::On my 8-minute stand-up sets, nobody can believe how good it.
0:49:13 - 0:49:16::Yo, Eric just crushed for 7-minute straight, dude.
0:49:17 - 0:49:18::No way.
0:49:18 - 0:49:19::Yeah, that's what people say.
0:49:19 - 0:49:25::Sometimes I feel like if we actually were like, hell a Christian or just religious in any way,
0:49:26 - 0:49:34::I think that's what we're missing between us being at the level we're at and being Stephen Colbert.
0:49:34 - 0:49:35::You know what I'm saying?
0:49:35 - 0:49:37::Oh, I'll build you up right now.
0:49:37 - 0:49:38::Do your God.
0:49:38 - 0:49:39::Please come.
0:49:39 - 0:49:40::We say it ourselves.
0:49:40 - 0:49:41::It's 20 seconds right now.
0:49:41 - 0:49:43::Let's say we ourselves, I'll do it for us.
0:49:43 - 0:49:44::Do your God.
0:49:44 - 0:49:45::We...
0:49:45 - 0:49:48::Jack in the sunlight, basking in God's sun.
0:49:50 - 0:49:51::Go, go, go.
0:49:51 - 0:49:54::Jack, do you accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior?
0:49:54 - 0:50:00::Do you accept that He died in the cross for your sins and do you repent for all your sins and choose to walk in the world?

0:50:00 - 0:50:03::way of the light from here on out.
0:50:03 - 0:50:04.840000::Can I still be Jewish?
0:50:04.840000 - 0:50:05.840000::No.
0:50:05.840000 - 0:50:06.920000::No, dude.
0:50:06.920000 - 0:50:07.920000::No.
0:50:07.920000 - 0:50:08.920000::All right.
0:50:08.920000 - 0:50:09.920000::I'm down.
0:50:09.920000 - 0:50:10.920000::I'm down.
0:50:10.920000 - 0:50:11.920000::I'm down.
0:50:11.920000 - 0:50:12.920000::No, for you to be one.
0:50:12.920000 - 0:50:13.920000::No, for you to be one.
0:50:13.920000 - 0:50:14.920000::And wait.
0:50:14.920000 - 0:50:15.920000::Okay.
0:50:15.920000 - 0:50:16.920000::And Nate.
0:50:16.920000 - 0:50:17.920000::Wait.
0:50:17.920000 - 0:50:20.360000::You were Christian once.
0:50:20.360000 - 0:50:24.080000::You were walking in the way of the light, but you turned.
0:50:24.080000 - 0:50:25.680000::Why did you turn to the darkness?
0:50:25.680000 - 0:50:26.680000::And will you be saved?
0:50:26.680000 - 0:50:28.680000::I said, man, I don't want to.
0:50:29.280000 - 0:50:30.080000::Okay.
0:50:30.080000 - 0:50:32.120000::Are you Christian now?
0:50:32.120000 - 0:50:33.760000::More Christian than ever before.
0:50:33.760000 - 0:50:39.160000::I want you to bring back some sort of violent,
0:50:39.160000 - 0:50:45.920000::Rome, Vatican style Christian behavior and re-enactment.
0:50:45.920000 - 0:50:47.480000::Whoa.
0:50:47.480000 - 0:50:51.320000::And now, Eric, do it for the listeners.
0:50:51.320000 - 0:50:54.960000::I can we save every person that's listening?
0:50:54.960000 - 0:50:55.800000::Oh, do it for the listeners.
0:50:55.800000 - 0:50:56.840000::Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
0:50:56.840000 - 0:50:58.480000::oh, I'm going to save myself a little bit.
0:50:58.480000 - 0:50:59.320000::Jesus.
0:50:59.320000 - 0:51:00.320000::Welcome back, bro.
0:51:00.320000 - 0:51:02.720000::Mr. Ass, I was just kind of chilling for a while.
0:51:02.720000 - 0:51:03.560000::I like it.
0:51:03.560000 - 0:51:05.160000::He was enjoying partying, but that's fucking rock.
0:51:05.160000 - 0:51:07.440000::From now on, here and out, you're my business partner.
0:51:07.440000 - 0:51:10.040000::You better help me out, or I'm ditching you again.
0:51:10.040000 - 0:51:11.040000::Okay.
0:51:11.040000 - 0:51:13.960000::Now, for the rest of the listeners, listeners,
0:51:13.960000 - 0:51:18.240000::do you accept Jesus as your personal savior?
0:51:18.240000 - 0:51:19.200000::Do you accept Him?
0:51:19.200000 - 0:51:22.320000::And do you take, will you let Him wash your sins away?
0:51:22.320000 - 0:51:24.480000::And do your prayer for all you've done?
0:51:24.480000 - 0:51:26.280000::In the name of God, amen.
0:51:26.280000 - 0:51:28.160000::Let us know.
0:51:28.160000 - 0:51:29.160000::Comment, yes or no?
0:51:29.160000 - 0:51:30.440000::Comment, comment, if we saved you,
0:51:30.440000 - 0:51:32.880000::we get to report that to our superiors.
0:51:32.880000 - 0:51:35.240000::Yeah, it's not a pyramid type scheme,
0:51:35.240000 - 0:51:37.240000::spiritual pyramid scheme, but we do get a crazy
0:51:37.240000 - 0:51:38.080000::has bonus.
0:51:38.080000 - 0:51:41.560000::Also, we should start, you remember, you remember in
0:51:41.560000 - 0:51:45.800000::callicism where they were going to know that booth
0:51:45.800000 - 0:51:48.600000::or pen their sins and the pre-short of the time.
0:51:48.600000 - 0:51:50.320000::Confession that booth.
0:51:50.320000 - 0:51:52.520000::Can we start the digital confessional booth
0:51:52.520000 - 0:51:55.400000::where people can eat unless all their sins every day?
0:51:55.400000 - 0:51:58.360000::And then we just reply back a tone or whatever.
0:51:58.360000 - 0:52:01.840000::We've been looking for something to put in the $10 tier.
0:52:02.840000 - 0:52:03.680000::Yeah.
0:52:05.680000 - 0:52:06.520000::You know what I'm saying?
0:52:06.520000 - 0:52:08.800000::We've been looking for something to put in the $10 tier.
0:52:08.800000 - 0:52:11.040000::If you, we're starting this now.
0:52:11.040000 - 0:52:13.600000::If you son of the $10 tier once a month,
0:52:13.600000 - 0:52:15.160000::we are holding confessional hour.
0:52:15.160000 - 0:52:18.520000::You get to come in, confess your worst sins.
0:52:20.040000 - 0:52:22.520000::But we have the same things, kind of rules as a therapist.
0:52:22.520000 - 0:52:23.680000::If you confess to kill someone,
0:52:23.680000 - 0:52:25.600000::we do have to report you.
0:52:25.600000 - 0:52:28.840000::And we will take you down a bounty hunter style.
0:52:28.840000 - 0:52:32::And by the way, it might look like we are just not actually
0:52:32 - 0:52:34.720000::on the Zoom and we have recorded videos of ourselves saying
0:52:34.720000 - 0:52:37.680000::we forgive you over and over and nodding our heads.
0:52:37.680000 - 0:52:41.280000::That's just how the religion works.
0:52:41.280000 - 0:52:42.440000::We are there.
0:52:42.440000 - 0:52:44.040000::It's fully we hear you.
0:52:44.040000 - 0:52:48.240000::And, and, dude, could we do this?
0:52:48.240000 - 0:52:50.480000::You know those things called taxes that we're about to pay
0:52:50.480000 - 0:52:51.960000::on this fucking shit?
0:52:51.960000 - 0:52:52.800000::I'm not going to say that.
0:52:52.800000 - 0:52:54.360000::But if joy taxes was a church,
0:52:54.360000 - 0:52:57.320000::and I feel like all of our listeners would be so down
0:52:57.320000 - 0:53:01.880000::to categorize us as a religion, we could be tax-free.
0:53:01.880000 - 0:53:05.720000::Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, we may as well.
0:53:05.720000 - 0:53:07.040000::So, so, so, so, so, how do we,
0:53:07.040000 - 0:53:09.760000::what's really going to stop us from being a religion
0:53:09.760000 - 0:53:11.400000::in the court of law?
0:53:11.400000 - 0:53:12.240000::Nothing.
0:53:12.240000 - 0:53:15.240000::Because everybody that's, everybody that we're,
0:53:15.240000 - 0:53:17.400000::that our listeners would be so down to be like,
0:53:17.400000 - 0:53:21.280000::you know, the church of what?
0:53:21.280000 - 0:53:22.120000::I'm down.
0:53:22.120000 - 0:53:23.200000::The church of joy, I think.
0:53:23.200000 - 0:53:25.080000::I could come up with my imagination.
0:53:25.080000 - 0:53:27.560000::I could come up with a even more powerful type,
0:53:27.560000 - 0:53:29.960000::Scientology type of religion.
0:53:29.960000 - 0:53:31.360000::Give me fucking 10 minutes.
0:53:31.360000 - 0:53:33.440000::I'll come up with a fucking crazy shit you've ever heard
0:53:33.440000 - 0:53:35.200000::that's getting all over the city.
0:53:35.200000 - 0:53:37.120000::Transversion of Scientology to mine.
0:53:37.120000 - 0:53:39.960000::And mine's so much more toxic, so much more evil.
0:53:42.080000 - 0:53:45.920000::So, what we're saying is, Jesus, we were rocking with you
0:53:45.920000 - 0:53:47.280000::for about three and a half minutes there,
0:53:47.280000 - 0:53:50.200000::but unfortunately, we got to start our own shit,
0:53:50.200000 - 0:53:51.200000::no, you had your chance.
0:53:51.280000 - 0:53:54::You've been letting the whole world down for 2,000 years.
0:53:54 - 0:53:56.080000::We still are fucking podcasting.
0:53:56.080000 - 0:53:59.040000::Has it really been 2,000, Jesus was here?
0:53:59.040000 - 0:54:00.520000::Doesn't that seem like a long time
0:54:00.520000 - 0:54:02.720000::and even not even that much time at the same time?
0:54:03.720000 - 0:54:05.720000::Time is weird like that.
0:54:05.720000 - 0:54:07.320000::Time goes by faster and faster.
0:54:07.320000 - 0:54:10.120000::This year felt like what a fucking week and a half?
0:54:10.120000 - 0:54:11.960000::Try to think back to this time last year.
0:54:11.960000 - 0:54:12.960000::Long long long.
0:54:12.960000 - 0:54:13.800000::Long long.
0:54:13.800000 - 0:54:14.640000::Long long.
0:54:14.640000 - 0:54:15.640000::Long long long.
0:54:15.640000 - 0:54:16.480000::Long long long.
0:54:16.480000 - 0:54:17.320000::Long long long.
0:54:17.320000 - 0:54:18.160000::Long long long long.
0:54:18.160000 - 0:54:19::Long long long long.
0:54:19 - 0:54:19.840000::Long long long long.
0:54:19.840000 - 0:54:20.840000::Long long long long long.
0:54:21 - 0:54:23.440000::But we did go to LA last year, that was fun.
0:54:23.440000 - 0:54:26.280000::Okay, so this is what a religion is by legal terms.
0:54:28.320000 - 0:54:31.040000::The term religion has reference to one's views
0:54:31.040000 - 0:54:35.560000::of his, interesting, his relations to his creator
0:54:35.560000 - 0:54:38.280000::and to the obligations they impose of reverence
0:54:38.280000 - 0:54:43.160000::for his being and character and of obedience to his will.
0:54:43.160000 - 0:54:44::What?
0:54:45 - 0:54:46.480000::We're gonna have to do some legal research.
0:54:46.480000 - 0:54:49.080000::We'll circle back with you guys on the status of this.
0:54:49.080000 - 0:54:50.480000::We'll check with our legal team.
0:54:50.480000 - 0:54:52.480000::Just now we are working on this.
0:54:52.480000 - 0:54:55.440000::Nate has a free lawyer right now
0:54:55.440000 - 0:54:58.480000::because you can't see but he's in a wheelchair but we're, you know.
0:54:59.480000 - 0:55:00.480000::We can probably

0:55:00 - 0:55:00.840000::I'm out with this.
0:55:02.120000 - 0:55:03.120000::It's insulting.
0:55:03.120000 - 0:55:04.800000::Yeah, can't even think of a joke.
0:55:06.640000 - 0:55:10.600000::Well guys, we just bodyed another episode essentially.
0:55:10.600000 - 0:55:13.400000::And we need to say what gave us joy, which is,
0:55:13.400000 - 0:55:17.160000::it's, I mean, this week was so crazy with it.
0:55:17.160000 - 0:55:18::Oh, you know what?
0:55:18 - 0:55:20.960000::I got a simple one and I don't care if it's food again,
0:55:20.960000 - 0:55:22.880000::but I just got, I was at the daily counter.
0:55:22.880000 - 0:55:25.640000::I usually get turkey and I saw they had to
0:55:25.640000 - 0:55:28.960000::to put like chicken and I was like, let me get that.
0:55:29.040000 - 0:55:32.240000::And actually, a chicken slice chicken on a sandwich,
0:55:32.240000 - 0:55:33.240000::pretty good with it.
0:55:33.240000 - 0:55:35.200000::So that's what gave me.
0:55:35.200000 - 0:55:36.720000::And I'm going to have a sandwich right after this
0:55:36.720000 - 0:55:37.720000::and go crazy on it.
0:55:37.720000 - 0:55:40::And I'm going to watch, by the way, TV gets,
0:55:40 - 0:55:42.480000::I don't watch movies while I eat.
0:55:42.480000 - 0:55:43.480000::Wow.
0:55:44.640000 - 0:55:45.480000::Okay. Wow.
0:55:45.480000 - 0:55:47.360000::Out of respect for the movies.
0:55:47.360000 - 0:55:48.200000::Out of respect.
0:55:49.440000 - 0:55:56.280000::I'm going to say my joy is, well, I feel like this is my favorite
0:55:56.280000 - 0:56:00.680000::time in LA and it's just gotten like really kind of
0:56:00.680000 - 0:56:04.920000::a little chilly and it's like the,
0:56:04.920000 - 0:56:07.600000::it's my favorite weather is like kind of,
0:56:08.560000 - 0:56:11.280000::I guess kind of like 58 or something
0:56:11.280000 - 0:56:13.160000::where you can kind of like wear a jacket
0:56:13.160000 - 0:56:16.560000::and fall spring like kind of on the chilly side.
0:56:16.560000 - 0:56:20::And today was a really, really, it's really,
0:56:20 - 0:56:23.360000::it's cold for LA, but, and I don't know,
0:56:23.360000 - 0:56:25.240000::there's like some sort of like a,
0:56:25.240000 - 0:56:26.960000::a, a, a, a, a, a, a,
0:56:26.960000 - 0:56:30.040000::plants or a folly edge that is blooming in the,
0:56:30.040000 - 0:56:31.640000::in the winter time that it's just,
0:56:31.640000 - 0:56:33.360000::folly, owls are different.
0:56:33.360000 - 0:56:35.440000::You know, they're, what am I trying to say?
0:56:35.440000 - 0:56:36.760000::Is that, is that what I'm looking for?
0:56:36.760000 - 0:56:37.600000::Foley.
0:56:37.600000 - 0:56:38.640000::Foley edge.
0:56:38.640000 - 0:56:39.960000::Foley edge?
0:56:39.960000 - 0:56:40.800000::What is it?
0:56:40.800000 - 0:56:41.640000::Foley edge?
0:56:41.640000 - 0:56:43.680000::Foley, yeah, foley edge.
0:56:43.680000 - 0:56:45.240000::I don't know why that was so funny.
0:56:45.240000 - 0:56:48.160000::I said, foley, foley edge.
0:56:48.160000 - 0:56:49::Okay.
0:56:49 - 0:56:49.840000::Foley edge.
0:56:49.840000 - 0:56:51.640000::We're, we're listening to our spare spare spare.
0:56:51.640000 - 0:56:52.480000::Continue.
0:56:52.600000 - 0:56:54.480000::You guys are making fun of me.
0:56:54.480000 - 0:56:57.280000::That would not, foylege, go with, foylege.
0:56:57.280000 - 0:56:58.080000::Foylege.
0:56:58.080000 - 0:56:59.080000::Foylege.
0:56:59.080000 - 0:57:00.080000::Foylege.
0:57:00.080000 - 0:57:01.960000::It's just, the smells are just,
0:57:01.960000 - 0:57:03.560000::it just smells different, you know.
0:57:03.560000 - 0:57:04.400000::It's popping.
0:57:04.400000 - 0:57:07.680000::And it kind of reminds me of when I first moved to LA
0:57:07.680000 - 0:57:10.160000::was, it was in January.
0:57:10.160000 - 0:57:12.960000::And I feel like when I first moved to LA,
0:57:12.960000 - 0:57:16.200000::oh my god, here we go.
0:57:16.200000 - 0:57:18::All about to happen.
0:57:18 - 0:57:18.840000::Yeah.
0:57:18.840000 - 0:57:23.520000::And this, this is about to be the beginning, you know.
0:57:23.520000 - 0:57:24.280000::City of sin.
0:57:24.280000 - 0:57:28.480000::So it kind of reminds me of that kind of hopeful, you know,
0:57:28.480000 - 0:57:31.560000::a spirit and feeling of the future.
0:57:31.560000 - 0:57:32.400000::That's beautiful.
0:57:34.160000 - 0:57:35.160000::How are you?
0:57:36.160000 - 0:57:40.480000::What gave me joy this week?
0:57:40.480000 - 0:57:45.480000::I'll have to say is a collection of experiences,
0:57:45.480000 - 0:57:50.480000::but all of them being summed up to perhaps the city of New York City.
0:57:50.480000 - 0:57:54.480000::Similar to Nate, it's become winter here once again.
0:57:54.480000 - 0:58:00.480000::And I just am so filled with joy to be frank about when the weather's nice
0:58:00.480000 - 0:58:04.480000::like this and cold, I feel like that's my natural, what my body wants.
0:58:04.480000 - 0:58:10.480000::And the smells are crispier and nice and going out and getting into the city
0:58:10.480000 - 0:58:13.480000::a good couple times this week going to Ruby McAulister's fragrance party
0:58:13.480000 - 0:58:14.480000::was a huge joy.
0:58:14.480000 - 0:58:15.480000::That was a huge joy.
0:58:15.480000 - 0:58:18.480000::I was a traditional least party tragedy.
0:58:18.480000 - 0:58:22.480000::A wonderful smell if you have a nose, go buy it and then going out,
0:58:22.480000 - 0:58:25.480000::going for a nice walk with my friend.
0:58:25.480000 - 0:58:27.480000::That was so beautiful.
0:58:27.480000 - 0:58:31.480000::And then of course yesterday going to the spa with some more friends
0:58:31.480000 - 0:58:32.480000::or whatever.
0:58:32.480000 - 0:58:33.480000::Son of Banya.
0:58:33.480000 - 0:58:34.480000::The Russian.
0:58:34.480000 - 0:58:35.480000::Banya.
0:58:35.480000 - 0:58:38.480000::And coming out back into the city.
0:58:38.480000 - 0:58:40.480000::The beautiful foil edge.
0:58:40.480000 - 0:58:41.480000::Take the train home 40 degrees.
0:58:41.480000 - 0:58:43.480000::I'm wearing flip flops.
0:58:44.480000 - 0:58:46.480000::That was a fucking joy.
0:58:46.480000 - 0:58:50.480000::That was the shizz that literally yesterday was quite fucking enjoyable
0:58:50.480000 - 0:58:52.480000::and getting a slice of New York City.
0:58:52.480000 - 0:58:54.480000::If you're thinking about moving here.
0:58:54.480000 - 0:58:55.480000::Do it.
0:58:55.480000 - 0:58:56.480000::Save up.
0:58:56.480000 - 0:58:57.480000::That's it.
0:58:57.480000 - 0:58:58.480000::Message for you Nate.
0:58:58.480000 - 0:59:02.480000::Elay is about to be in the fucking Pacific Ocean due to my prediction.
0:59:02.480000 - 0:59:05.480000::My fucking calculations about the quake.
0:59:05.480000 - 0:59:06.480000::Get out of here.
0:59:06.480000 - 0:59:07.480000::We're gonna have to get out of here.
0:59:07.480000 - 0:59:10.480000::I'll move to New York when the Patreon gets 20.
0:59:10.480000 - 0:59:13.480000::Can we get it to 25k right now?
0:59:13.480000 - 0:59:16.480000::We need some one big donor.
0:59:16.480000 - 0:59:17.480000::Is that a bump?
0:59:17.480000 - 0:59:18.480000::Is that a bump?
0:59:18.480000 - 0:59:19.480000::15 grand a month.
0:59:19.480000 - 0:59:20.480000::Put it down right now.
0:59:20.480000 - 0:59:22.480000::There's one billionaire out there.
0:59:22.480000 - 0:59:23.480000::That's fucking listening.
0:59:23.480000 - 0:59:24.480000::I know you.
0:59:24.480000 - 0:59:25.480000::Put it down.
0:59:25.480000 - 0:59:26.480000::You know it's trippin' off.
0:59:26.480000 - 0:59:27.480000::I can see it.
0:59:27.480000 - 0:59:28.480000::One cup.
0:59:28.480000 - 0:59:29.480000::Take it.
0:59:29.480000 - 0:59:30.480000::Take it.
0:59:30.480000 - 0:59:31.480000::Oh man.

0:59:34.480000 - 0:59:36.480000::We gotta end the part.
0:59:36.480000 - 0:59:37.480000::Alright.

0:59:40.480000 - 0:59:42.480000::Is it TV or is it movies?
0:59:43.480000 - 0:59:45.480000::Well actually, the choice is up to you.
0:59:45.480000 - 0:59:46.480000::And we respect all creators.
