0:05:52.600000 - 0:05:55.680000::But there's something about just the lips looking all sticky and wet
0:05:55.920000 - 0:06:01.160000::Well, you know what I like is when some people got the hyper wet lip where it's
0:06:01.560000 - 0:06:07.200000::Their lips are all wet, but then they like to let you know that they have more in the chamber until the spit's coming up

0:24:33.160000 - 0:24:34.480000::Yeah.
0:24:34.480000 - 0:24:37.400000::We need to do the first ever podcast episode
0:24:37.400000 - 0:24:41.720000::with one foot in Norway, one foot in Russia.
0:24:41.720000 - 0:24:44.640000::And we can have a maybe like a giant pit
0:24:44.640000 - 0:24:46.840000::that we're in and have all the locals surrounding us.
0:24:46.840000 - 0:24:47.840000::Wow.
0:24:47.840000 - 0:24:48.920000::Half-nourning.
0:24:48.920000 - 0:24:53.040000::We're going to need to hire some mercenary modigards.
0:24:53.040000 - 0:24:54.120000::Oh, we should maybe.
0:24:54.120000 - 0:24:54.720000::Yeah.
0:24:54.720000 - 0:24:55.440000::You know what?
0:24:55.440000 - 0:24:59.080000::I just watched, I watched this guy who built a log cabin
0:24:59.080000 - 0:25:00.120000::on the back of a...

0:25:00 - 0:25:06.640000::F350 truck from the 90s and the log cabin is kind of frankly corny
0:25:06.640000 - 0:25:11.360000::I wish he would have made it look a little more cool. It just looks like a hallmark cabin
0:25:11.640000 - 0:25:14.760000::But he drove from a lap bottom of Alaska
0:25:15.600000 - 0:25:21.320000::All the way up to the Arctic Circle and he gets basically to the end of civilization
0:25:21.320000 - 0:25:27.080000::He fills up his diesel. He's got two tanks fills it up to the brim and then he gets on this dirt road
0:25:27.080000 - 0:25:34.080000::And you think you're at the end of civilization and he goes whoops looks like we have another 500 miles until we get to the Arctic Circle
0:25:34.800000 - 0:25:39.560000::Good guy. Could you guys handle an adventure like that or would you perish at the thought of it?
0:25:39.560000 - 0:25:40.440000::I
0:25:40.440000 - 0:25:44.280000::Would need somebody in the car with me who knows how to perform an appendectomy
0:25:45.160000 - 0:25:48.840000::Because that's when it happens. Well, you might got to do it on yourself like that guy with a mirror
0:25:49.480000 - 0:25:53.480000::That's no problem. Remember that guy had to do that. That's the first ever guy, right? Isn't that the first guy to do it?
0:25:53.480000 - 0:25:58.280000::He did it on himself. They got that crazy picture from holding the mirror. He's touching his guts. You know seeing this mate
0:25:58.680000 - 0:26:02.040000::That's an easy one to do though. I don't even know what an epa what it would be
0:26:02.040000 - 0:26:06.440000::Epidectomy and epidectomy. I'm not supposed to know what that is
0:26:07.240000 - 0:26:12.400000::Because you got one man or maybe you don't maybe forgot you had your appendix burst like Colbert
0:26:13.720000 - 0:26:15.400000::What huh?
0:26:15.400000 - 0:26:20.360000::Does that happen to him? Yeah, recently happened to have Colbert. I got it. No quite recently. Yeah, it bursted

0:29:30.680000 - 0:29:34.520000::So you can go anywhere in the world. Let's say that you go anywhere in the world for free
0:29:35.240000 - 0:29:42.200000::But you have a 79% chance of being violently killed in public every single time. Okay
0:29:43.080000 - 0:29:45.880000::How often are you going to be doing that?
0:29:46.440000 - 0:29:48.440000::Hmm
0:29:54.600000 - 0:29:57.720000::Well, I'm bringing this sentiment sentiment to mind because

0:30:05 - 0:30:06::Yeah.
0:30:06 - 0:30:09::So if you had to, instead of it being a saesana,
0:30:09 - 0:30:12::if it was basically like,
0:30:12 - 0:30:15::mmm, a more dangerous airplane.
0:30:15 - 0:30:16::Right.
0:30:16 - 0:30:17::A fighter jet.
0:30:17 - 0:30:19::Let me try and phrase this to a way
0:30:19 - 0:30:20::that you Simpleton's can understand.
0:30:20 - 0:30:21::Please, I don't know.
0:30:21 - 0:30:22::Yeah, yeah, yeah.
0:30:22 - 0:30:26::Would you, let's say there's a teleportation device,
0:30:26 - 0:30:27::you own it.
0:30:27 - 0:30:29::Would you go up in that thing?
0:30:29 - 0:30:32::If it meant that you might come out the other side
0:30:32 - 0:30:33::with no heartbeat.
0:30:33 - 0:30:34::70% chance.
0:30:34 - 0:30:36::70% chance of dying?
0:30:36 - 0:30:37::That's a question.
0:30:37 - 0:30:38::Every time.
0:30:38 - 0:30:39::Every time.
0:30:39 - 0:30:40::Yeah.
0:30:40 - 0:30:41::No, I wouldn't do that unless I was teleporting
0:30:41 - 0:30:43::out of a 100% death situation.
0:30:43 - 0:30:44::Oh, that's good.
0:30:44 - 0:30:46::What if it was a 80% death situation?
0:30:46 - 0:30:48::That's when I say,
0:30:48 - 0:30:50::God, take the wheel.
0:30:50 - 0:30:51::You know what?
0:30:51 - 0:30:54::I say, yes.
0:30:54 - 0:30:56::I'm taking that chance.
0:30:56 - 0:30:57::I'm trying to,
0:30:57 - 0:31:00::I want to inspire people to take more risks in life.
0:31:00 - 0:31:02::And I feel like we are so risk averse.
0:31:02 - 0:31:03::But what's the worst that can happen?
0:31:03 - 0:31:04::What's the last risk you took?
0:31:04 - 0:31:06::Now, you keep preaching the app.
0:31:06 - 0:31:07::Shut the fuck up.
0:31:07 - 0:31:09::You dumb ass fucking.
0:31:09 - 0:31:10::Don't you, man.
0:31:10 - 0:31:11::Don't you risk right now.
0:31:11 - 0:31:12::For me, it's all to me.
0:31:12 - 0:31:13::That's a major risk.
0:31:13 - 0:31:15::Good thing I'm in a good mood.
0:31:15 - 0:31:17::Goddamn it.
0:31:17 - 0:31:20::God, you're in a good mood.
0:31:20 - 0:31:22::I don't know.
0:31:22 - 0:31:23::Good.
0:31:23 - 0:31:24::You don't want to see Eric when he hasn't had the
0:31:24 - 0:31:26::mashed potatoes and roast beef breakfast.
0:31:26 - 0:31:28::It wasn't mashed, man.

0:31:42 - 0:31:44::where you have dinner the night before, right?
0:31:44 - 0:31:46::It's all made into certain type of way.
0:31:46 - 0:31:48::You put it on a plate.
0:31:48 - 0:31:50::So last night was roast beef,
0:31:50 - 0:31:51::smashed potatoes.
0:31:51 - 0:31:53::Okay, you know what those are.
0:31:53 - 0:31:54::This is the pub.
0:31:54 - 0:31:55::This is like pub style.

0:32:10 - 0:32:12::Okay, you can smash any potato,
0:32:12 - 0:32:13::but this is how you usually do it.
0:32:13 - 0:32:17::Smash that potato, parboil it, do get, get kind of soft.
0:32:17 - 0:32:20::Put it in the oven, get it all crispy, broil it.
0:32:20 - 0:32:22::You could put it in a pan and get it all crispy,
0:32:22 - 0:32:25::but you've kind of put a little oil in it and it crisps up.
0:32:25 - 0:32:26::It's delicious.
0:32:26 - 0:32:27::That's how it's delicious.
0:32:27 - 0:32:29::And then salad.

0:32:56 - 0:32:59::being like near death starvation.
0:32:59 - 0:33:01::But now this is just after sleeping in.

0:35:19.760000 - 0:35:27.880000::But the one of the friends of the pod sent us a bunch of sacks underwear. Oh, it's great. I'm wearing it right now
0:35:27.880000 - 0:35:29.880000::I'm wearing a
0:35:29.880000 - 0:35:35.260000::X-menus and it has like a little pouch for your balls, you know like it's kind of the
0:35:35.260000 - 0:35:41.360000::Say yeah, they invented a side they invented like a new sort of ball sack technology and
0:35:42.720000 - 0:35:47.380000::Man they're they're they feel pretty good like I had that shit and I remember back in the day
0:35:47.380000 - 0:35:49.380000::But then the technology was lost
0:35:49.380000 - 0:35:56.860000::And now the ancient ball sack technology. I think it's an ancient I'm sure the pharaohs had this and you can see how good of
0:35:56.860000 - 0:36:02.440000::Basically, this is like a good example of what an ad read could be like if you do want to sponsor the podcast. This is like
0:36:03.200000 - 0:36:08.380000::Look at how enticing with being about these ancient nuts act technology
0:36:08.460000 - 0:36:12.220000::So if we're running a $25 CPM, okay?
0:36:12.860000 - 0:36:17.260000::$25 cost per mill and pressure cost per a thousand impressions
0:36:17.260000 - 0:36:19.260000::Okay

0:36:31.420000 - 0:36:36.580000::So if we get one of the best sponsors to come in but with a pay in a $25 CPM
0:36:36.580000 - 0:36:39.660000::We're maxing out at about 100 dollars per app
0:36:40.540000 - 0:36:44.220000::For now, I just want you guys to remember that's what you're making now
0:36:45.140000 - 0:36:50.660000::Now let's come back in six months to the TV after NBC picks it up the mystery project
0:36:50.660000 - 0:36:52.160000::I've talked about yet
0:36:52.280000 - 0:36:58.400000::Then by the way wait till we're all 37 years old and then you're gonna be thinking twice about
0:36:59 - 0:37:02.080000::What we are living like because it will be amazing
0:37:05.760000 - 0:37:09.160000::You know, I'm gonna just do the research for the rest of this episode
0:37:12.360000 - 0:37:17.360000::Young Jay you become young Jamie on our podcast. I'm gonna be a little Jackie
0:37:18.360000 - 0:37:20.840000::Now do you you're doing great. We're doing great
0:37:21.840000 - 0:37:27.880000::Everyone's healthy especially me we are doing. Oh, I'm wearing the uggs. Everybody wanted to see him well young to see him
0:37:28.160000 - 0:37:30.160000::But I'm wearing them
0:37:30.520000 - 0:37:36::Right now that they were made for Australian Sith as did you know that you sweating them huh?
0:37:36.840000 - 0:37:38.840000::They're made for the beach
0:37:38.840000 - 0:37:43.040000::They were made for Australian surfers coming back from the beach needs them to want but there's
0:37:43.600000 - 0:37:45.840000::There's hair in them right. Yeah sheep
0:37:46.880000 - 0:37:48.400000::Yeah
0:37:48.400000 - 0:37:55.780000::Wow, so how do you wash them all the time because you've got got a magic and I'll stinky and sweaty that's what you would think
0:37:58.120000 - 0:37:59.720000::But
0:37:59.720000 - 0:38:03.400000::And frankly someone's gonna call me out on this. I don't know how you would wash it
0:38:03.400000 - 0:38:07.520000::But apparently not so much to wear this ox that's sacrilegious with these
0:38:08.800000 - 0:38:10.800000::Because it feels better on your feet probably
0:38:11.760000 - 0:38:18.080000::Yep, you feel good. This is just a dumb thought but whatever. I'm just gonna say don't ever call
0:38:18.080000 - 0:38:23.080000::Stupid just pop it. Stop it. Stop staying this shit. You're gonna be like yeah, that was stupid
0:38:23.880000 - 0:38:27.240000::No, you're selling yourself shorts so that we hide you all good all right
0:38:27.240000 - 0:38:33.240000::So this just popped in my head and I was like I feel like that material is really it feels really good
0:38:33.240000 - 0:38:35.760000::I've never put on a hug but I can I feel like I can
0:38:36.200000 - 0:38:40.120000::Sense what it would feel like in my foot and it feels pretty cozy, right?
0:38:41.160000 - 0:38:43.160000::So you wear what 14th Nate?
0:38:44.320000 - 0:38:46.320000::15
0:38:48.320000 - 0:38:50.320000::Instead of 15
0:38:50.320000 - 0:38:52.320000::Man, or is it 15 clean?
0:38:52.800000 - 0:38:57.560000::It's a fit you know, I could fit into some you know 14 or there's 16s
0:38:58.400000 - 0:39:03.840000::No, I can't I'm not I'm not pushing past there are 16s, but it's like that's like freaks
0:39:03.840000 - 0:39:07.480000::That's for freaks. I mean that's freaks 15s are normal as hell
0:39:07.480000 - 0:39:14::But if you're 16 foot then you're fucking freak. Do they they make you know how they make wide shoes do they make narrow shoes?
0:39:15.640000 - 0:39:17.640000::A 16 narrow that's
0:39:21.400000 - 0:39:25.920000::Skinny 16 that's that 10-foot alien invading Miami. We need to talk about that
0:39:27.760000 - 0:39:30.080000::Why else would there be so many police vehicles?
0:39:30.080000 - 0:39:34.560000::That's what I fucking thinking I'm on the scanners. I'm going in the bathroom at parties trying to just
0:39:34.560000 - 0:39:38.280000::What are they saying on these police scanners and yeah, they saw 10 foot aliens
0:39:38.760000 - 0:39:41::Hopping in the journeys trying on the
0:39:44 - 0:39:48.880000::They're trying to have a good time. Oh, they're trying to slurp up some cinnamon absorb it through their skin
0:39:48.880000 - 0:39:55.120000::That's a bad way to enjoy it. We couldn't enjoy life the way that aliens are able to enjoy it because they have more senses than us

0:40:00 - 0:40:02.240000::I saw that bit do worse than anyone's ever seen.
0:40:02.240000 - 0:40:07.400000::I mean, should we tell them now, man?
0:40:07.400000 - 0:40:09.640000::Sure, I think we can now.
0:40:09.640000 - 0:40:13.760000::Well, you guys know who Lauren Michael is, right?
0:40:13.760000 - 0:40:16.160000::I feel like did I not tell this before?
0:40:16.160000 - 0:40:21.040000::So I put the alien speak bit in my standup over the summer.
0:40:21.040000 - 0:40:24.120000::And I did it a couple of times and somehow it crushed
0:40:24.120000 - 0:40:26.800000::in my perception of how it went.
0:40:26.800000 - 0:40:30.200000::And basically I say, man, to all the aliens in here tonight,
0:40:30.200000 - 0:40:32.440000::I have a message for you when I start going like,
0:40:32.440000 - 0:40:36::talking to an alien speak, I'm intelligible.
0:40:36 - 0:40:37.960000::But frankly, I tried to mix it up a little bit
0:40:37.960000 - 0:40:41.600000::for the SNL edition and tried to make it a little bit more
0:40:41.600000 - 0:40:42.120000::topical.
0:40:42.120000 - 0:40:45.360000::So I was saying some shit about Joe Biden and like,
0:40:45.360000 - 0:40:48.280000::you could hear a little bit less through the alien speak.
0:40:48.280000 - 0:40:49.360000::And I was like, you know what?
0:40:49.360000 - 0:40:51.400000::I'm going to start off strong with this new bit.
0:40:51.400000 - 0:40:52.320000::And it's going to crush.
0:40:52.320000 - 0:40:56.680000::Go out there, start doing that shit.
0:40:56.680000 - 0:40:59.320000::Your silence could hear the door hinge.
0:40:59.320000 - 0:41:03.120000::Could hear it in the back quiet, the door swinging,
0:41:03.120000 - 0:41:04.240000::silence.
0:41:04.240000 - 0:41:06.440000::How bad was it, Jack?
0:41:06.440000 - 0:41:11.840000::For one full 60 second long minute, I was thinking,
0:41:11.840000 - 0:41:16::he's going to have to be really strong to get it.
0:41:16 - 0:41:17.880000::And then I got out of it, huh?
0:41:17.880000 - 0:41:20.160000::I crawled my way out.
0:41:20.160000 - 0:41:20.680000::Yeah.
0:41:20.680000 - 0:41:22.320000::But that was a brutal.
0:41:22.320000 - 0:41:24.560000::I just remember thinking, so be it.
0:41:24.560000 - 0:41:26.240000::This is one of the worst moments of my life.
0:41:26.600000 - 0:41:28.800000::No, but you looked so cool, man, because you know,
0:41:28.800000 - 0:41:30.640000::at the end of eight mile, what that was like, right?
0:41:30.640000 - 0:41:33.480000::Because Eminem starts out and everybody's beat starts.
0:41:33.480000 - 0:41:35.040000::And they're like, oh, he's choking.
0:41:35.040000 - 0:41:38.960000::He's going to choke again like he did in the beginning.
0:41:38.960000 - 0:41:40.760000::Psych then you go into the bee boxing.
0:41:40.760000 - 0:41:43.680000::Psych then you go into the one about whatever.
0:41:43.680000 - 0:41:46.200000::And I had some topical jokes too that showed them how quick
0:41:46.200000 - 0:41:48.520000::I am with the current events.
0:41:48.520000 - 0:41:50.840000::And yeah, I think that they're intimidated by the three of
0:41:50.840000 - 0:41:51.960000::because Nate, you auditioned too.
0:41:51.960000 - 0:41:53.560000::You didn't tell anybody this.
0:41:53.560000 - 0:41:54.720000::That's right.
0:41:54.720000 - 0:41:57.160000::And Nate, didn't you suck on something in your ass?
0:41:57.160000 - 0:41:59.640000::And Nate, you went to this too.
0:41:59.640000 - 0:42:01.200000::You went to the studio.
0:42:01.200000 - 0:42:02.040000::Oh, yeah.
0:42:02.040000 - 0:42:04.960000::I remember talking to you in the dressing room.
0:42:04.960000 - 0:42:05.720000::I'm the phone.
0:42:05.720000 - 0:42:09.640000::I was watching, I was just chilling in there, watching
0:42:09.640000 - 0:42:11.640000::succession on my laptop.
0:42:11.640000 - 0:42:12.360000::OK.
0:42:12.360000 - 0:42:14.560000::Getting into the knee art mood.
0:42:14.560000 - 0:42:15.840000::Yeah.
0:42:15.840000 - 0:42:18.240000::When the season one was out too, that was that was the whole
0:42:18.240000 - 0:42:18.920000::idea.
0:42:18.920000 - 0:42:20.040000::Oh, boy, you're having fun.
0:42:20.040000 - 0:42:24.320000::And was it your heart beating through your chest?
0:42:25.120000 - 0:42:32::I mean, obviously, I was like really nervous when it was
0:42:32 - 0:42:32.840000::actually happening.
0:42:32.840000 - 0:42:36.080000::I was like, oh my god, this is crazy.
0:42:36.080000 - 0:42:37.560000::This is wild.
0:42:37.560000 - 0:42:39.640000::So yeah, this podcast is mostly bullshit.
0:42:39.640000 - 0:42:41.800000::But if you listen enough, you get a little taste of the
0:42:41.800000 - 0:42:46.720000::Mart Marin style, hard hitting, comedy, journalism.
0:42:46.720000 - 0:42:47.680000::How many history stories?
0:42:47.680000 - 0:42:51.040000::Well, let me ask you how this would feel to you.
0:42:51.040000 - 0:42:53.440000::Now that we're on this topic.
0:42:53.440000 - 0:42:55.960000::So I'm in the stew.
0:42:55.960000 - 0:42:59.560000::I'm doing the SNL edition on the fucking stage, right?
0:42:59.560000 - 0:43:03::And they tell you this.
0:43:03 - 0:43:06.080000::3, 2, 1, and then you slate your name, right?
0:43:06.080000 - 0:43:08.680000::And then you go into it at your own pace.
0:43:08.680000 - 0:43:09.800000::Have I told this on here before?
0:43:09.800000 - 0:43:10.720000::I don't think so.
0:43:10.720000 - 0:43:11.440000::I don't think so.
0:43:11.440000 - 0:43:13.520000::So basically, what they didn't fucking tell me is that
0:43:13.520000 - 0:43:15.640000::there's going to be two different 3, 2, 1.
0:43:15.640000 - 0:43:18.720000::And the first one was just for the fucking camera guys.
0:43:18.720000 - 0:43:20.800000::So they go 3, 2, 1.
0:43:20.800000 - 0:43:22.480000::And the camera rolls and nobody does anything.
0:43:22.760000 - 0:43:24.840000::I say my name all loud.
0:43:24.840000 - 0:43:26.800000::Hey, what's up, I'm Jacky, whatever.
0:43:26.800000 - 0:43:30.400000::And then they go, not yet.
0:43:30.400000 - 0:43:32.320000::And that got a laugh.
0:43:32.320000 - 0:43:35.120000::What you call that is you call that got a laugh at me,
0:43:35.120000 - 0:43:37.040000::I would say.
0:43:37.040000 - 0:43:39.720000::And then guess what?
0:43:39.720000 - 0:43:40.720000::I've started.
0:43:40.720000 - 0:43:42.680000::I waited for the next countdown.
0:43:42.680000 - 0:43:45.120000::You're hyperventilating sweat dripping off your nose.
0:43:45.120000 - 0:43:46.320000::Sweat dripping on my head.
0:43:46.320000 - 0:43:48.880000::And then I remember.
0:43:48.880000 - 0:43:52.720000::I go, what would Goku S's J3 do right now?
0:43:52.720000 - 0:43:56.200000::I turn around.
0:43:56.200000 - 0:43:57.040000::What's he doing?
0:43:57.040000 - 0:43:59.160000::I don't remember seeing that bit in the live showcase.
0:43:59.160000 - 0:44:02.520000::That's, I don't remember that.
0:44:02.520000 - 0:44:04.760000::All of a sudden, whip out a fucking ukulele
0:44:04.760000 - 0:44:05.600000::from behind my back.
0:44:05.600000 - 0:44:06.600000::Joe Biden.
0:44:11.320000 - 0:44:14.440000::Damn, hairs all blonde, fucking on fire.
0:44:14.440000 - 0:44:15.440000::Wow.
0:44:15.440000 - 0:44:16.880000::Well, you know what they're doing, Jack?
0:44:16.880000 - 0:44:18.560000::They're trying to fuck with you, man.
0:44:18.560000 - 0:44:20.200000::That's what they do with these things.
0:44:20.200000 - 0:44:21.800000::We are a lot of issues with the bull.
0:44:21.800000 - 0:44:23.320000::They try to fuck with your head.
0:44:23.320000 - 0:44:24.560000::Well, guess what?
0:44:24.560000 - 0:44:25.240000::Yeah.
0:44:25.240000 - 0:44:27.440000::Next person who goes in that fucking studio,
0:44:27.440000 - 0:44:30.160000::I want you to fuck with them.
0:44:30.160000 - 0:44:34.080000::When you're back there, I need you to put, slip them a,
0:44:34.080000 - 0:44:35.800000::I don't know, a drink or something like that.
0:44:35.800000 - 0:44:38.760000::And then in there, in the drink, it's pure vodka
0:44:38.760000 - 0:44:39.760000::or something like that.
0:44:39.760000 - 0:44:41.400000::There's just mess with everybody.
0:44:41.400000 - 0:44:42.840000::You know, some of the alcohol, yep.
0:44:42.840000 - 0:44:43.840000::Dose with alcohol.
0:44:43.840000 - 0:44:46.240000::Well, you can't, you can't mess with anybody
0:44:46.240000 - 0:44:47.640000::who's trying to fuck with my mind.
0:44:48.840000 - 0:44:51.280000::You can't fuck with something that's already so fucked up.
0:44:51.280000 - 0:44:53.160000::You can't even imagine it, right?
0:44:53.160000 - 0:44:55.880000::Because imagine trying to basically like throw water
0:44:55.880000 - 0:44:58.960000::on a computer and then the computer's over here
0:44:58.960000 - 0:45:00.960000::all the sudden in the dashboard.

0:45:00 - 0:45:02.840000::is made out of the same materials as a regular computer.
0:45:02.840000 - 0:45:06.120000::Yeah, what if that computer's a abacus?
0:45:06.120000 - 0:45:11.720000::What if a natural computer, one of the mold types from Egypt?
0:45:11.720000 - 0:45:12.840000::That what that is.
0:45:12.840000 - 0:45:15.040000::Are you still working on your abacus skills there?
0:45:15.040000 - 0:45:17.400000::I've been trying to design a new type of abacus that's
0:45:17.400000 - 0:45:19.920000::going to take over.
0:45:19.920000 - 0:45:22::That's going to take over.
0:45:22 - 0:45:22.920000::I'll tell you what.
0:45:22.920000 - 0:45:24.560000::I just want to say this really quickly.
0:45:24.560000 - 0:45:26.480000::This technology, this version of our technology,
0:45:26.480000 - 0:45:28.120000::we're going to have to pull the plug on all tech
0:45:28.120000 - 0:45:30.280000::because AI is going to go crazy.
0:45:30.280000 - 0:45:33.240000::Then we're going to come back with the more rock type tech.
0:45:33.240000 - 0:45:35.680000::So once we finally go interstellar,
0:45:35.680000 - 0:45:37.960000::we're going to be fucking flying around in rocks.
0:45:37.960000 - 0:45:39.080000::It's going to be abacus.
0:45:39.080000 - 0:45:41.080000::It's going to be all natural technology.
0:45:41.080000 - 0:45:41.920000::I'm telling you.
0:45:41.920000 - 0:45:43.560000::Those aren't safe for car accidents
0:45:43.560000 - 0:45:45.760000::if two people are driving a rock because they don't crumple.
0:45:45.760000 - 0:45:46.520000::Right.
0:45:46.520000 - 0:45:47.200000::You know what I'm saying?
0:45:47.200000 - 0:45:48.200000::Yeah.
0:45:48.200000 - 0:45:49.280000::I'll think about that.
0:45:49.280000 - 0:45:51.120000::Well, that's why they're so far from
0:45:51.120000 - 0:45:54.520000::using those super steel 1950s.
0:45:54.520000 - 0:45:55.360000::Eric.
0:45:55.360000 - 0:45:56.440000::Cadillac, dude.
0:45:56.440000 - 0:46:00.400000::Like, please forget what you're saying right now, man.
0:46:00.400000 - 0:46:01.720000::What's up with this new cyber truck?
0:46:01.720000 - 0:46:03.240000::Can we talk about that thing for real?
0:46:03.240000 - 0:46:04.080000::I've been waiting.
0:46:04.080000 - 0:46:04.960000::This tech, what is it?
0:46:04.960000 - 0:46:06.480000::The Tesla cyber truck?
0:46:06.480000 - 0:46:11.360000::This thing looks like a freaking dust it has toaster, in my opinion.
0:46:11.360000 - 0:46:15.160000::That's the, that was the second minute of Jack at SNL.
0:46:15.160000 - 0:46:19.360000::You're getting rocks thrown at you.
0:46:19.360000 - 0:46:22.040000::Yeah, just like rubbing my neck skin all the way off.
0:46:22.040000 - 0:46:23.040000::Blood on my hand.
0:46:23.040000 - 0:46:26::Nate, what's the worst you ever bombed, dude?
0:46:26 - 0:46:30.480000::The worst I ever bombed was, oh, this is easy.
0:46:30.480000 - 0:46:31.320000::Easy.
0:46:31.320000 - 0:46:37.320000::There was a, this is when I was just in college, I had a stand-up act in college.
0:46:37.320000 - 0:46:40.840000::And I thought I was like changing stand-up through this.
0:46:40.840000 - 0:46:46.080000::I was like, I would do like a joke and then I would comment on like, you see why that's
0:46:46.080000 - 0:46:53.280000::funny is because I, explaining like the joke, I would explain it too much.
0:46:53.280000 - 0:46:57.600000::And I did it like a couple times at like open mics in Columbus and it was like, did
0:46:57.600000 - 0:47:02.760000::okay, and like one time it did really well and I was like, oh shit, like I figured out
0:47:02.760000 - 0:47:03.760000::something, you know?
0:47:03.760000 - 0:47:04.760000::Yeah.
0:47:04.760000 - 0:47:10.440000::And I was working at Putten Bay in the island in like Erie during the summer.
0:47:10.440000 - 0:47:16.440000::And there was this, and I was like, man, I would love to do a show on this island.
0:47:16.440000 - 0:47:19.840000::Like I, there was no way I could perform the whole summer.
0:47:19.840000 - 0:47:26.040000::Like I was all throughout college, I was doing shows like maybe four, I don't know,
0:47:26.040000 - 0:47:29.040000::three or four times a week at least.
0:47:29.040000 - 0:47:30.480000::And I was like itching to do a show.
0:47:30.480000 - 0:47:34.840000::There was a bar manager who had done stand-up in Chicago.
0:47:34.840000 - 0:47:40.200000::Like he used to do stand-up in Chicago and he's like, there's this guy, he's coming through.
0:47:40.200000 - 0:47:42.760000::His name was like Jason Lawhead or I think.
0:47:42.760000 - 0:47:47.960000::And he was like a stand-up who's like open for Bilber and he was kind of like a road dog
0:47:47.960000 - 0:47:48.960000::like stand-up.
0:47:49.120000 - 0:47:51.760000::Really nice guy but he was like coming through to Putten Bay.
0:47:51.760000 - 0:47:53.080000::We're gonna put on this show.
0:47:53.080000 - 0:47:54.880000::Oh, you do comedy, Nate.
0:47:54.880000 - 0:47:58.720000::You should do a set and I was like, dude, this is gonna be fun.
0:47:58.720000 - 0:48:01.320000::I invited every coworker I had.
0:48:01.320000 - 0:48:05.360000::Everyone I knew on the island that I had been talking so much shit the whole time.
0:48:05.360000 - 0:48:07.880000::Like dude, you don't know how fucking funny I am on fucking stage.
0:48:07.880000 - 0:48:09.800000::I'm like, I'm a comedian, you know?
0:48:09.800000 - 0:48:13.160000::And they're like, oh shit, I get to actually see what this person's made of.
0:48:13.160000 - 0:48:14.160000::You know?
0:48:14.160000 - 0:48:16.240000::Every person that I had been like, yo, this is kind of my dream.
0:48:16.240000 - 0:48:17.960000::I'm gonna be the rest of my life.
0:48:17.960000 - 0:48:20.360000::This is what my calling is.
0:48:20.360000 - 0:48:25.520000::So every person I knew on the island was there at this show.
0:48:25.520000 - 0:48:27.280000::And I do my stand-up routine.
0:48:27.280000 - 0:48:28.280000::Oh, he is.
0:48:28.280000 - 0:48:29.280000::He is 20.
0:48:29.280000 - 0:48:32.280000::I'm like 19 or 20.
0:48:32.280000 - 0:48:33.280000::Oh, okay.
0:48:33.280000 - 0:48:38.880000::And I'm doing this bit and it is like just crickets.
0:48:38.880000 - 0:48:44.080000::Like, you think they would even give me some courtesy last but these people and my co-workers
0:48:44.080000 - 0:48:45.080000::were so cold.
0:48:45.080000 - 0:48:46.080000::And Bob.
0:48:46.080000 - 0:48:47.920000::Do you remember what the bit was?
0:48:47.920000 - 0:48:55::The bit was me doing a joke and then I would explain the joke over explaining the joke.
0:48:55 - 0:49:03.400000::And it was like, man, I was sweating up there and just like, it was just so humiliating.
0:49:03.400000 - 0:49:09.600000::Because I think they were just like, oh, you're not funny, you know?
0:49:09.600000 - 0:49:13.080000::Did people fuck with you after that or are people afraid to look at you?
0:49:13.080000 - 0:49:16.760000::I was just like, it was one of those things where I was like, just talk to the least
0:49:16.760000 - 0:49:21.520000::amount of people after and go home and just kind of like forget that this even happened.
0:49:21.520000 - 0:49:25.500000::You're lucky that there was no peanut butter whiskey invented yet or you would have been
0:49:25.500000 - 0:49:30.760000::fucking no D six feet under.
0:49:30.760000 - 0:49:37.160000::Don't let Nate get around that.
0:49:37.160000 - 0:49:40.160000::I have to hide this cue ball when Nate comes around.
0:49:40.160000 - 0:49:48.600000::So, so grateful that peanut butter whiskey was around the roll of the day.
0:49:48.600000 - 0:49:53.740000::Did they comment on it at work later or was it just unspoken?
0:49:53.740000 - 0:49:55.320000::Like wow, Nate really fucked up.
0:49:55.320000 - 0:49:59.980000::I think it was so uncomfortable that even they weren't like, cuz you're not gonna be
0:49:59.980000 - 0:50:00.980000::like, yeah.

0:50:00 - 0:50:04.400000::like what are you gonna say to somebody who just humiliated themselves like hey good you're not gonna
0:50:04.400000 - 0:50:09.120000::say like good set because everyone knew like it was bad so you can't even lie and be like hey I
0:50:09.120000 - 0:50:16.400000::had a really fun time you know there's like somebody can do so bad that you can't even like lie and
0:50:16.400000 - 0:50:25.360000::say like hey man good set you know it's just like no one even commented on it they're just like let's
0:50:25.360000 - 0:50:30.400000::just like move past this and like I worked at this restaurant back to somewhere we're on the
0:50:30.400000 - 0:50:36.080000::used to table whatever and at least it's just you know what because people say like oh you have
0:50:36.080000 - 0:50:42.160000::to be so good like brave to do public speaking of any sort because you could be all made fun of like
0:50:42.160000 - 0:50:48.160000::that humiliated but imagine that level of failure in another field like if you made some food
0:50:48.720000 - 0:50:52.080000::if you had a restaurant and you made some food that was so bad that nobody could ever look you
0:50:52.080000 - 0:50:56.400000::in the eye ever again to be honest with you right that would and that would make a lot of people
0:50:56.400000 - 0:51:02.720000::quit right it would but it didn't make me quit that's what we're talking about that's the drive me
0:51:02.720000 - 0:51:07.840000::quit to get to where we are that's why we're talking about travel that's travel
0:51:10.240000 - 0:51:16.800000::to have a podcast in your 30s that's what it takes oh by the way I have some amazing news right
0:51:16.800000 - 0:51:21.040000::you've seen cat Williams's thing going around right 22 million views whatever oh well
0:51:21.840000 - 0:51:30.320000::innovations video magazine over 4,000 views in a way oh you didn't know it could happen I
0:51:30.320000 - 0:51:35.360000::think you're being held down by some similar cat Williams style Illuminati nonsense where they
0:51:35.360000 - 0:51:41.040000::don't want the algorithm has been tuned into what you are unveiling to the public and it doesn't
0:51:41.040000 - 0:51:47.200000::want it to get out so very similar to cat Williams you're being silenced and yet I don't care man
0:51:47.200000 - 0:51:52.880000::I don't care you don't at the end of the day the winner these evil people can frame reality how they
0:51:52.880000 - 0:51:58.880000::want but history books aren't just written by winners they're written by people who like winner
0:51:58.880000 - 0:52:02.960000::like the losers sometimes you know what I'm saying because they're the next one you know what I'm
0:52:02.960000 - 0:52:06.640000::saying yeah you don't even got to say that already now history books can be rewritten
0:52:07.840000 - 0:52:11.600000::I trust me I know about that I'm rewriting some of them let me keep going on this by the way
0:52:12.800000 - 0:52:16.960000::history isn't even gotten from books anymore these days so you can write the history books but you
0:52:16.960000 - 0:52:25.520000::can't write street books you know what I'm trying to say there I think so close you can't write truth
0:52:25.520000 - 0:52:30.960000::you know I'm you know you can't write what people are talking about to each other about shit
0:52:34 - 0:52:42.880000::yeah I think I'd know what you're well man I was just talking to Caleb about how I want
0:52:43.840000 - 0:52:49.200000::an older war call of duty game to come out not necessarily call duty we need some fresh blood in
0:52:49.200000 - 0:52:58::that in the war in the shooter category but imagine a revolutionary war oh yeah where you don't
0:52:58 - 0:53:02.880000::have to yeah with the way it going and maybe the muskets are automatic that's the only difference
0:53:02.880000 - 0:53:07.760000::because it would be born automatic musket can you imagine scaring the hell out of the
0:53:07.760000 - 0:53:15.280000::bridge with one of them because that's like a cannonball right a musket yeah musket is like well
0:53:15.280000 - 0:53:21.040000::muskets are like a gun but it's like right right fired with oh oh oh I kind of like I got a bell
0:53:21.040000 - 0:53:26.720000::bottom on that yeah this is a bell bottom is it a bell I think the bell bottoms are the member we
0:53:26.720000 - 0:53:33.520000::went to oh were you there Nate for James's after James died no no and we went to that old timey
0:53:33.520000 - 0:53:41.840000::house from like the uh they had shit in the attic the house is built in like 1790 and they had
0:53:41.840000 - 0:53:47.600000::all this shit in the attic that was like journals from 1760 whatever and they had a blunt I think
0:53:47.600000 - 0:53:53.600000::what you're thinking about is a blunder bus a bomb that's right yeah and there's a picture of us
0:53:53.600000 - 0:53:59.200000::holding it and you can take one of those point blank to the chest and still fucking walk around
0:53:59.280000 - 0:54:05.040000::no problem and go eat supper and just have some tanks yeah those things are like a airsoft that's how
0:54:05.040000 - 0:54:10.720000::war was so fucked up back then man it took so much to take somebody out you had to people were
0:54:10.720000 - 0:54:16.320000::were so much they had so much tenacity all right and they had so much will to live that it took
0:54:16.320000 - 0:54:21.200000::wars I feel like those battles took like weeks yeah to take out a whole you know what I'm saying
0:54:21.840000 - 0:54:28::because the weapons were so unless unless you had I'm sure they're hiding some type of big fat
0:54:28 - 0:54:31.920000::cannon that we don't know about because all the cannons you see pretty small ones I'm gonna take
0:54:31.920000 - 0:54:38.160000::out three guys his heads but if you made a cannon fat enough where it's like literally oh man
0:54:38.640000 - 0:54:45.280000::that's a football side football field size cannon and the ball is whatever that big just shoot
0:54:45.280000 - 0:54:52.800000::that at the big of ball the giant has ball like an ancient nuclear war like right nuclear weapon right
0:54:52.800000 - 0:54:59.920000::big ass rock like the ones from the like it's to be yeah wow that's me with like two shares

0:55:00 - 0:55:05.240000::the end stage syphilis with the fucking glasses like trying to figure it out on a chalkboard and 17
0:55:06.120000 - 0:55:08.120000::We've got the longest wig
0:55:08.120000 - 0:55:10.120000::craziest longest wig
0:55:10.120000 - 0:55:12.120000::It's hell
0:55:12.320000 - 0:55:13.520000::Yeah
0:55:13.520000 - 0:55:18.480000::Well, man a lot of these wars probably ended with just whoever could stay up the latest
0:55:18.880000 - 0:55:22.560000::Yeah, all right. We're here. We're here. We're we control the field. I guess they went to bed

1:00:25.200000 - 1:00:27.480000::When reality clashes with expectations perhaps
1:00:27.480000 - 1:00:30.520000::we should change our expectations.
1:00:30.520000 - 1:00:33.640000::Except that you won't drop old habits over the course of a week
1:00:33.640000 - 1:00:34.680000::or even a month.

1:04:03.960000 - 1:04:08::And it's a woman who is near retirement age.
1:04:08 - 1:04:12.480000::And she kind of finds a passion for detective work
1:04:12.480000 - 1:04:13.440000::in her older age.
1:04:13.440000 - 1:04:16.520000::And she recruits a young assistant who you may know
1:04:16.520000 - 1:04:20.800000::as the British guy from last, Mambehem.
1:04:20.800000 - 1:04:23.240000::Dominic Zahman.
1:04:23.240000 - 1:04:25.400000::Oh, and he's also in the lower the rings as I believe.
