0:00:43 - 0:00:45::Analysis, which I'm talented in very naturally.
0:00:45 - 0:00:48::We are...
0:00:48 - 0:00:49::Yeah, I mean...
0:00:49 - 0:00:52::Yeah, we're three people who have...
0:00:52 - 0:00:55::Basically, centered our lives around risks,
0:00:55 - 0:00:58::taking risks personally, professionally, spiritually.
0:00:58 - 0:00:59::Educational risks.
0:00:59 - 0:01:00::Educational risks, of course.
0:01:00 - 0:01:02::I was just thinking today about how instead of going to college,
0:01:02 - 0:01:05::I stayed home and made rap videos in Virginia.
0:01:05 - 0:01:06::That was a huge risk.
0:01:06 - 0:01:07::And did it pay off?
0:01:07 - 0:01:09::Not directly.
0:01:09 - 0:01:10::Yes, it has.
0:01:10 - 0:01:11::Yes, it has.
0:01:11 - 0:01:13::Yeah, it most definitely has.
0:01:13 - 0:01:16::Well, the connections I made, the person that was working for back there,
0:01:16 - 0:01:19::discovered somebody who you may have heard of called the baby.
0:01:19 - 0:01:21::Now, we don't support the baby because of what we say.
0:01:21 - 0:01:22::Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
0:01:22 - 0:01:23::What?
0:01:23 - 0:01:24::That's right.
0:01:24 - 0:01:25::You've had that...
0:01:25 - 0:01:26::You kind of...
0:01:26 - 0:01:29::You kind of discovered the baby, you know, we...
0:01:29 - 0:01:30::Tangentially.
0:01:30 - 0:01:33::I was wondering why I felt that way.
0:01:33 - 0:01:35::Like, whenever I hear the baby, I feel like...
0:01:35 - 0:01:37::Like, when I hear somebody else listening to it,
0:01:37 - 0:01:39::I feel like...
0:01:39 - 0:01:42::Taking credit for it and like, they're fucking with me lately.
0:01:42 - 0:01:43::Yeah.
0:01:43 - 0:01:44::But didn't...
0:01:44 - 0:01:48::The baby do Panini with Lil Nas X, and yet he was homophobic.
0:01:48 - 0:01:53::Well, this is the cataclysmic correspondence between business and...
0:01:54 - 0:01:56::Goddamn, I hate to face...
0:01:56 - 0:01:58::I hate it when you're too faced like that.
0:01:58 - 0:01:59::Come on now.
0:01:59 - 0:02:06::If you're now rocking with the LGBTQ community, get out of my life now.
0:02:06 - 0:02:07::Leave now.
0:02:07 - 0:02:09::And that's...
0:02:09 - 0:02:13::It's crazy to be a celebrity and homophobic these days.
0:02:13 - 0:02:14::It's wrong with you.
0:02:14 - 0:02:15::It's wrong.
0:02:15 - 0:02:17::It was sick back in the day, man.
0:02:17 - 0:02:18::I hear you there.
0:02:18 - 0:02:19::All right.
0:02:19 - 0:02:21::We got to answer one.
0:02:21 - 0:02:25::We got to answer one follow-up question from the last day of May.
0:02:25 - 0:02:30::One that we thought was interesting and special and comments on masculinity.
0:02:30 - 0:02:34::The question was, do men ever get flowers?
0:02:34 - 0:02:42::You know, because women traditionally get flowers out the wazoo every single day of their lives.
0:02:42 - 0:02:46::I'm getting flowers nonstop for people for women.
0:02:46 - 0:02:49::But do we ever get flowers as men?
0:02:49 - 0:02:50::No.
0:02:50 - 0:02:51::I'll tell you what.
0:02:51 - 0:02:52::I'll tell you what.
0:02:52 - 0:02:53::I'll never beg.
0:02:53 - 0:02:54::I'll never beg.
0:02:54 - 0:02:55::I'll never beg.
0:02:55 - 0:03:02::Now that you mention it, psych men don't need flowers.
0:03:02 - 0:03:07::We need respect, admiration and things that are substantial within curating life.
0:03:07 - 0:03:08::Cheese curls.
0:03:08 - 0:03:10::No, you know what?
0:03:10 - 0:03:13::I'm saying we need some food as well.
0:03:13 - 0:03:16::I'm saying flowers are awesome in the house.
0:03:16 - 0:03:17::You think what's the point?
0:03:17 - 0:03:19::Flowers couldn't be that nice.
0:03:19 - 0:03:22::You put that shit in a vase.
0:03:22 - 0:03:23::You put it on your table.
0:03:23 - 0:03:26::You immediately feel like lifted.
0:03:26 - 0:03:29::You feel as though there are angels floating around in your house.
0:03:29 - 0:03:30::Natural angels.
0:03:30 - 0:03:31::Natural.
0:03:31 - 0:03:33::Man, fuck that shit.
0:03:33 - 0:03:35::Give me some head.
0:03:35 - 0:03:37::You're right.
0:03:37 - 0:03:39::I don't fucking need flowers.
0:03:39 - 0:03:41::I want head.
0:03:41 - 0:03:42::Hey man.
0:03:42 - 0:03:43::No, I want it.
0:03:43 - 0:03:46::And that's why you're not getting any flowers, man.

0:04:03 - 0:04:07::And instead of buying the pre-made ones, I look at that and say tacky.
0:04:07 - 0:04:08::Get that shit out of here.
0:04:08 - 0:04:12::It's not even as healthy because it's been sitting all, okay.
0:04:12 - 0:04:16::I put them together and I always body the fucking bouquets.
0:04:16 - 0:04:17::Okay.
0:04:17 - 0:04:18::Why is that?
0:04:18 - 0:04:21::Because I'm not getting just the big roses and the purple, whatever.
0:04:21 - 0:04:25::I'm getting greenery, things that aren't just, you know, things that might look a little,
0:04:25 - 0:04:27::you're putting like grass in there.
0:04:27 - 0:04:28::Essentially.
0:04:28 - 0:04:32::It's like green natural, earthy bouquets, okay?
0:04:32 - 0:04:36::Let me tell you what's been done.
0:04:36 - 0:04:37::What?
0:04:37 - 0:04:45::And Eric, your respect and incorporation of nature into the things that are ordinarily so
0:04:45 - 0:04:47::maintained and contrived as beautiful.
0:04:47 - 0:04:48::Thank you, man.
0:04:48 - 0:04:53::Now, I kind of take it the opposite way for real.
0:04:53 - 0:04:59::My girlfriend, she has a creature living amongst her known as a cat, C-A-T, Feline.
0:04:59 - 0:05:00::Now,

0:05:00 - 0:05:02.640000::Those things are allergic to many types of
0:05:04.140000 - 0:05:09.380000::Many types of different plants so my intention is never to murder that cat
0:05:09.440000 - 0:05:16.120000::Despite what people say and despite it attacking me in the middle of the night and ruining my sleep and fucking fucking me up
0:05:18.520000 - 0:05:24.780000::What did I do I made Raleigh a bouquet bouquet out of Legos
0:05:24.780000 - 0:05:29.340000::Hmm, dude awesome
0:05:32.860000 - 0:05:34.860000::That was the thing
0:05:34.860000 - 0:05:39.780000::To the train museum and then you talked about really funny man really funny
0:05:40.140000 - 0:05:45.300000::No, listen she looked at me after I did that and said hey, I don't think I can ever look at you romantically
0:05:45.300000 - 0:05:47.980000::It is ever again. That was a childish like
0:05:49.060000 - 0:05:53.940000::No, I think I didn't actually do that but I did but I didn't buy them somebody else bought them for her
0:05:54.420000 - 0:05:56.420000::It was a family member
0:05:57.380000 - 0:06:00.920000::It was not another man, but well it was but it was a familial man, so
0:06:02.100000 - 0:06:04.100000::We're good
0:06:04.100000 - 0:06:08.900000::How do you all react if someone's jokin on your girl mac and on your girl

0:06:16.220000 - 0:06:20.420000::You know, I'm just making all up on jokking on me. Jack Benzinger
0:06:20.420000 - 0:06:23.980000::Well, there's a couple ways to approach it
0:06:25.700000 - 0:06:27.220000::There's
0:06:27.220000 - 0:06:28.700000::confrontation
0:06:28.700000 - 0:06:32.100000::Mm-hmm. That's risky because what if somebody's risk?
0:06:32.100000 - 0:06:38.420000::They see how seamlessly we make this shit happen. You see it right? Yeah, it's this is our improv brains
0:06:38.420000 - 0:06:42.460000::This is what second city fucking taught us by the way. Yeah
0:06:43.020000 - 0:06:45.020000::I'm gonna so yeah
0:06:45.420000 - 0:06:48.780000::Confertation so there's ways to go about it. There's confrontation. There's cowering
0:06:49.340000 - 0:06:50.860000::There's using mental
0:06:50.860000 - 0:06:52.860000::Assessing atoreic tactics
0:06:55.980000 - 0:06:58.060000::Mental assessing the Tory and
0:06:59.580000 - 0:07:01.580000::Okay, so let's say all right Nate

0:07:08.380000 - 0:07:14.460000::The strokes and it was sick. Yeah, but you were too busy in the corner with your headphones on listening to knives and
0:07:14.620000 - 0:07:16.620000::Classic
0:07:16.860000 - 0:07:18.860000::Dance and her as I'm getting all sweaty
0:07:25.020000 - 0:07:33.500000::So some fucking young Tom Cruise comes up and just takes the back of his hand and just goes like this upon your chicks arm
0:07:36.380000 - 0:07:41.500000::I'm already pissed and I'm already pissed off just by this scenario. Okay. Well, that's what it's designed to do
0:07:41.500000 - 0:07:44.580000::So so pissed off so so how are you reacting now are you?
0:07:46.220000 - 0:07:51.180000::Are you assuming that this first off? I don't have ownership of my my girlfriend, you know
0:07:51.180000 - 0:07:57.820000::I'm saying I do not own her at all. She's not mine. She is not she's the property of herself. Okay. Yeah. Thank you Nate

0:11:34.720000 - 0:11:35.720000::You know what, man?
0:11:35.720000 - 0:11:39.800000::I think you don't like that they're taking a risk and they're taking.
0:11:39.800000 - 0:11:43.720000::I'll tell you what, a chance of the biggest risk is the white dreads.
0:11:43.720000 - 0:11:45.720000::Very good, Eric, by the way, risk.
0:11:45.720000 - 0:11:48.960000::I'll tell you what, and I mean this.

0:11:55.880000 - 0:11:57.320000::Jesus was a white guy with dreads.
0:11:57.320000 - 0:11:58.480000::Prove me wrong.
0:11:58.480000 - 0:12:02.720000::How could he not have been?
0:12:02.720000 - 0:12:04.080000::Can we just meet in the middle?
0:12:04.080000 - 0:12:05.320000::What is that shroud?
0:12:05.320000 - 0:12:08.920000::They claim to have the shroud that he was wrapped in that shows his face.
0:12:08.920000 - 0:12:09.920000::What the fuck?
0:12:09.920000 - 0:12:10.920000::What is that shroud?
0:12:10.920000 - 0:12:12.400000::He got crystallized on it.
0:12:12.400000 - 0:12:13.400000::Like fossilized.
0:12:13.400000 - 0:12:16.360000::They found his face fossilized in some toilet.
0:12:16.360000 - 0:12:18.240000::Is that in the Holy Grail or something?
0:12:18.240000 - 0:12:20.600000::Oh, that's a comedy.
0:12:20.600000 - 0:12:24.520000::I think it, our church was the shroud of turin.
0:12:24.520000 - 0:12:26.440000::That's what I thought it was.
0:12:26.440000 - 0:12:28.080000::That's the shit in Red Bull.
0:12:28.080000 - 0:12:37.160000::If you look at the shroud of turin, which I believe shows Jesus as he was, it looks like
0:12:37.160000 - 0:12:38.400000::a white guy with dread.
0:12:38.400000 - 0:12:39.400000::I like it.
0:12:39.400000 - 0:12:41.440000::The shroud of turin.
0:12:41.440000 - 0:12:42.440000::Yeah.

0:12:44.440000 - 0:12:45.440000::The shroud of turin.
0:12:45.440000 - 0:12:51.520000::Jesus Christ rendering of what he looks like.
0:12:51.520000 - 0:12:54.760000::He doesn't look pretty.
0:12:54.760000 - 0:12:58.120000::He looks like my dad, honestly.
0:12:58.120000 - 0:13:05.200000::In the shroud of turin, he looks like the smaller guy from Flight of the Concords.
0:13:05.200000 - 0:13:07.560000::If he was like a tech and character zone.
0:13:07.560000 - 0:13:14.640000::Yo, they're saying, kind of Jesus looks like me a little bit realistic.
0:13:14.640000 - 0:13:16.240000::What did everybody Google now?
0:13:16.240000 - 0:13:19.360000::I googled realistic Jesus.
0:13:19.360000 - 0:13:22.040000::Okay, realistic Jesus.
0:13:22.040000 - 0:13:23.720000::One of them that looks just like Vuccane.
0:13:23.720000 - 0:13:24.720000::Oh shit.
0:13:24.720000 - 0:13:25.720000::It's a mare.
0:13:25.720000 - 0:13:28.960000::One of them looks like Jack.
0:13:28.960000 - 0:13:34.720000::One of them is that guy from the guy Wolverine guy.
0:13:34.720000 - 0:13:35.720000::Yeah.
0:13:35.720000 - 0:13:36.720000::Jesus.

0:13:37.720000 - 0:13:40.480000::Jesus when he's got the little pencil mustache kind of looks like.
0:13:40.480000 - 0:13:41.800000::What's that guy's name?
0:13:41.800000 - 0:13:43.320000::It's young gravy's friend maybe.
0:13:43.320000 - 0:13:47::His name's like Lil Virgin or something, Lil No Sex or something.
0:13:47 - 0:13:48::I don't know.
0:13:48 - 0:13:49::I don't know.
0:13:49 - 0:13:50.760000::I mean, Jesus was a virgin.
0:13:50.760000 - 0:13:53.240000::So he can depend like that.
0:13:53.240000 - 0:13:58.040000::I bet you God made him like, you know, a little fugly.
0:13:58.040000 - 0:14:01.600000::I bet there's no question that Jesus was fugly.
0:14:01.600000 - 0:14:03.640000::You know what I mean?
0:14:03.640000 - 0:14:08.760000::Because that's just another challenge for him to get over and people wouldn't treat him
0:14:08.760000 - 0:14:10.120000::good just because of how he looked.
0:14:10.120000 - 0:14:11.120000::You know what I'm saying?
0:14:11.120000 - 0:14:12.280000::Right, right, right.
0:14:12.280000 - 0:14:14.760000::He doesn't look good and you know what?
0:14:14.760000 - 0:14:19::In any Google image result of realistic Jesus, there's no good option.
0:14:19 - 0:14:20.400000::You know, they all don't look.
0:14:20.400000 - 0:14:21.400000::I know.
0:14:21.400000 - 0:14:22.400000::I'm seeing some sexy.

0:14:28.400000 - 0:14:32.760000::I'm seeing you being Jesus could fight.
0:14:32.760000 - 0:14:33.760000::There's no way he wouldn't know.
0:14:33.760000 - 0:14:35.760000::He turns the other cheek away away.
0:14:35.760000 - 0:14:36.760000::All right.
0:14:36.760000 - 0:14:37.760000::He would be about.
0:14:37.760000 - 0:14:41.920000::He'd be a good psychological warfare person because he's God.
0:14:41.920000 - 0:14:42.920000::He'd be a death year.
0:14:42.920000 - 0:14:48.120000::I was rocking with Jesus so fucking hard.
0:14:48.120000 - 0:14:50.040000::I was rocking with him.

0:14:51.360000 - 0:14:52.360000::Well, go ahead.
0:14:52.360000 - 0:14:59.880000::Well, just Eric, now you've taken a risk in giving up your allegiances to Jesus.

0:15:00 - 0:15:03.600000::big risk, dude, when I didn't ask this. The biggest risk you could take really.
0:15:04.400000 - 0:15:07.200000::I remember have I told this story where
0:15:08.320000 - 0:15:14.320000::stopping Christian for various reasons and then there was about six months where I was like
0:15:14.320000 - 0:15:22.720000::rocking agnostic Lee and then I went on a trip with my family to Washington DC and we went into
0:15:23.280000 - 0:15:29.920000::an old art museum and there was a tiny picture of Jesus painting ancient painting from
0:15:29.920000 - 0:15:35.760000::whatever hundreds of years ago and I saw the painting and I got just like
0:15:38.240000 - 0:15:47.280000::chills I got chills and I took that as a sign of what have I fucking I forsaken God I said no to God
0:15:47.280000 - 0:15:53.760000::and this guy died for my sins and I turned him away what if I did so then I then for about two
0:15:53.760000 - 0:15:58.400000::weeks I was like rocking with Jesus again praying to his ass saying take me back to me back now
0:15:59.280000 - 0:16:04.080000::now and then I started back down the path of darkness where you see me today
0:16:04.800000 - 0:16:12.880000::well the thing is you can't operate on fear right right I hate fear based tactics I hate them
0:16:12.880000 - 0:16:20::well it's joy tactics of course right so if you know if if there's a God and the only way
0:16:20 - 0:16:25.040000::that they can convince you to join them in the war on whatever they want to do is through

0:26:38.640000 - 0:26:43.920000::obsessed with Harrison Ford recently. I've been watching all these Harrison Ford movies and he
0:26:43.920000 - 0:26:49.280000::fucking knocks it out. He's not just Han Solo. He's not just Indiana Jones. He's a bunch of
0:26:49.280000 - 0:26:53.920000::different characters. Okay. And he that he's an I'm in love with Harrison Ford from the from the 90s
0:26:53.920000 - 0:27:00.800000::and 80s. That's nothing to be ashamed of. Do you know how he got to start? He was a carpenter.
0:27:00.800000 - 0:27:05.440000::He was a podcasting. He wasn't even I don't think he was even an actor, right? He was just a carpenter.
0:27:06 - 0:27:15.120000::Maybe he was in like apocalypse now and a bunch of I tell you all my favorite actors didn't

0:27:23.920000 - 0:27:32.560000::William Heng? It's because acting is fucking easy. Acting is because of the talented. It's interesting.
0:27:32.560000 - 0:27:40.480000::What is talent? Why did I? I'm just saying like if you're talented, not saying I am, but I probably am in
0:27:40.480000 - 0:27:48.320000::some way. Then yeah, it's easy to the outside observer. Wait, but I need to say this about Harrison Ford.
0:27:48.320000 - 0:27:52.480000::Okay. I've been watching I'll list some of the movies clear and present danger regarding Henry.
0:27:52.480000 - 0:27:59.200000::Witness. There's about four movies that came out in the 80s and 90s, maybe just three,
0:27:59.200000 - 0:28:04.240000::where Harrison Ford is wrongly accused of killing his wife. Are you still going?
0:28:06.240000 - 0:28:14.640000::Or some explanation? There's maybe some. He's involved with some kind of

0:29:12.480000 - 0:29:17.200000::two reviews, one star. It looked like the most busted piece of shit I've ever seen.
0:29:17.200000 - 0:29:22.160000::It's all recorded on camcorder. And Harrison Ford is listed as an actor in it.
0:29:23.680000 - 0:29:27.360000::And I need to find the name of this. I'll find it before the end of the show. Like, is he actually
0:29:27.360000 - 0:29:32.560000::in it or is it? He is actually in it. He's in someone's like student film for a little bit and he

0:30:00 - 0:30:04.560000::I wanted to tell everybody that's crazy man never count somebody out from doing something like that
0:30:05.440000 - 0:30:07.920000::Never ever and speaking of Star Wars
0:30:08.720000 - 0:30:10.720000::Maybe one of the biggest risks
0:30:10.920000 - 0:30:13.440000::What people with George Lucas took
0:30:14.080000 - 0:30:16.240000::Because he was nobody believed in him

0:35:54.280000 - 0:36:00.760000::And he switches himself with like basically sends himself back to the Roman times.
0:36:00.760000 - 0:36:05.560000::And so this is this fucking goofy ass rushing guy in his neighbor who are being like hunted
0:36:05.560000 - 0:36:08.880000::and murdered by a bunch of old Roman people.
0:36:08.880000 - 0:36:12.400000::And then there's like a Roman king chilling out in the apartment in Russia.
0:36:12.400000 - 0:36:14.240000::And they're like trying to play cool.
0:36:14.240000 - 0:36:15.240000::It's really funny.
0:36:15.240000 - 0:36:16.600000::And it's like an old movie.
0:36:16.600000 - 0:36:22.200000::So it's not like, there's only like, I feel like three or four locations in it.
0:36:22.200000 - 0:36:24.640000::It's very entertaining.
0:36:24.640000 - 0:36:25.640000::Richard's popular.
0:36:25.640000 - 0:36:31.160000::So that cinema is fucking dead and it will never come back to what it was.
0:36:31.160000 - 0:36:33.160000::That's what they said.
0:36:33.160000 - 0:36:36.320000::That's what it says when the talk when the talkies took over the silent films.
0:36:36.320000 - 0:36:37.320000::You know what I mean?
0:36:37.320000 - 0:36:40::And so you know, cinema is always changing.
0:36:40 - 0:36:41.240000::It's malleable.
0:36:41.240000 - 0:36:44.240000::Every generation says this is the last great generation.
0:36:44.240000 - 0:36:49.680000::We haven't had some solid hits in a minute, but filmmaking is more accessible to people
0:36:49.680000 - 0:36:51.480000::across the world than it ever has.
0:36:51.480000 - 0:36:55.040000::So I don't need white men like Richard Lincolay are coming in my face, tell me cinema's
0:36:55.040000 - 0:36:58.080000::dead because he ain't watching where the good shit is.
0:36:58.080000 - 0:36:59.080000::Okay.
0:36:59.080000 - 0:37:03.560000::Well, people like Richard Lincolay are coming on my face and tell me all this fucking bullshit.
0:37:03.560000 - 0:37:05.560000::About what?
0:37:05.560000 - 0:37:08.920000::Clip it, clip it, clip it.
0:37:08.920000 - 0:37:10.400000::That's the clip for the week.
0:37:10.400000 - 0:37:11.400000::Okay.
0:37:11.400000 - 0:37:15.680000::Wait, the Russian movie is called Ivan Vasilyovich.
0:37:15.680000 - 0:37:16.840000::Back to the future.
0:37:16.840000 - 0:37:17.840000::And I looked at you.
0:37:17.840000 - 0:37:18.840000::1973 Moscow.
0:37:18.960000 - 0:37:21.400000::The Harrison Ford short.
0:37:21.400000 - 0:37:25.160000::And we'll link the Vimeo to this so people can watch it.
0:37:25.160000 - 0:37:27.560000::The movie is called Water to Wine.
0:37:27.560000 - 0:37:34.640000::And the poster of it is like a grainy ass, CPA pick, MacBook style photo picture of him.
0:37:34.640000 - 0:37:39.040000::And the tagline is what up, beatch.
0:37:39.040000 - 0:37:40.040000::You know what?
0:37:40.040000 - 0:37:41.040000::I respect that so much.
0:37:41.040000 - 0:37:42.040000::Is that sick?
0:37:42.040000 - 0:37:43.040000::Like why did he do it?
0:37:43.040000 - 0:37:45.040000::And it would come into a student film like that.
0:37:45.040000 - 0:37:50.080000::I feel like a lot of these big actors, if we're talking about putting your 10,000 hours
0:37:50.080000 - 0:37:55.040000::into something, they are only, they, you can get more selective with your projects as
0:37:55.040000 - 0:37:58.080000::you become the Adam drivers of the world, you know?
0:37:58.080000 - 0:38:02.920000::So you might not be getting the reps that you need to get to that next level.
0:38:02.920000 - 0:38:04.280000::You know what I'm saying?
0:38:04.280000 - 0:38:09.560000::So yeah, I want to encourage more of these a list actors to hop on, you know, sort of
0:38:09.560000 - 0:38:12.640000::our social media videos.
0:38:12.640000 - 0:38:13.640000::And you know,
0:38:13.640000 - 0:38:17.600000::these extra hours, yeah, that's going to make you, that's going to be closer to the Oscar
0:38:17.600000 - 0:38:18.600000::for that special product.
0:38:18.600000 - 0:38:22.660000::If you're out there, if you're out there and you're feeling a little stuck, you got
0:38:22.660000 - 0:38:25.280000::writer's block and your name is Drake.
0:38:25.280000 - 0:38:27.280000::Your name is Egyzea.
0:38:27.280000 - 0:38:28.280000::Yeah.
0:38:28.280000 - 0:38:32.240000::See, your name is who is an actor Andy Milanochus.
0:38:32.240000 - 0:38:33.880000::Andy Milanochus.
0:38:33.880000 - 0:38:37.920000::Uh, who's like killing it like three or four years ago?
0:38:37.920000 - 0:38:38.920000::Hmm.
0:38:38.920000 - 0:38:39.920000::What about?
0:38:39.920000 - 0:38:41.720000::Um, I stay a J fish.
0:38:41.720000 - 0:38:42.720000::I say, J J fish.
0:38:42.720000 - 0:38:43.720000::Whoa.
0:38:43.720000 - 0:38:44.720000::I say, J fish.
0:38:44.720000 - 0:38:46.720000::It's up any time for anything.
0:38:46.720000 - 0:38:48.720000::I love him.
0:38:48.720000 - 0:38:51.720000::Um, no, but hit us up and come hang.
0:38:51.720000 - 0:38:52.720000::Yeah.
0:38:52.720000 - 0:38:56.400000::Come listen to iron and wine with us and fucking wake up in the morning and bring the cheese
0:38:56.400000 - 0:38:58.200000::with us and shit.
0:38:58.200000 - 0:39:01.800000::Um, I want to take it back for one second, ask you guys a question.
0:39:01.800000 - 0:39:04.160000::I love doing these hypothetical questions.
0:39:04.160000 - 0:39:05.640000::And I think we love them as well.
0:39:05.640000 - 0:39:08.080000::I think listeners adore it.
0:39:08.080000 - 0:39:11.960000::What would you guys do when you come to New York?
0:39:11.960000 - 0:39:16.800000::I said, you guys, would you come out with me tonight and come to this club?
0:39:16.800000 - 0:39:22.400000::It's a prohibition style club and you got to dress like you're from the 20s.
0:39:22.400000 - 0:39:23.400000::You guys want to come?
0:39:23.400000 - 0:39:24.400000::I'll hook it up.
0:39:24.400000 - 0:39:25.400000::I'll get you all suited up.
0:39:25.400000 - 0:39:28.120000::But you got to look like you're from the 20s.
0:39:28.120000 - 0:39:33.960000::And basically I take you to an ancient door that has been at the townhouse and I knock
0:39:33.960000 - 0:39:35.560000::on the door.
0:39:35.560000 - 0:39:36.560000::And it all goes quiet.
0:39:36.560000 - 0:39:45.480000::The city street goes quiet around us and then come with me and you'll be in a world
0:39:45.480000 - 0:39:46.480000::of people.
0:39:46.480000 - 0:39:47.480000::Lights are flashing around.
0:39:47.480000 - 0:39:50.360000::You're not feeling what you feel like you're getting the bends.
0:39:50.360000 - 0:39:51.360000::What the hell?
0:39:51.360000 - 0:39:52.520000::The door opens.
0:39:52.520000 - 0:39:56.280000::It's a 1920s prohibition bar for real.
0:39:56.280000 - 0:39:59.080000::You've gone back in time to the 20s.
0:39:59.080000 - 0:40:00::And then I turn around and I'm going to go.

0:40:00 - 0:40:02.240000::I said, I've passed the curse onto you guys.
0:40:02.240000 - 0:40:04.880000::You're stuck here now forever.
0:40:04.880000 - 0:40:06.920000::You will never go back to your families.
0:40:06.920000 - 0:40:08.080000::And this is your reality now.
0:40:08.080000 - 0:40:09.840000::You live in the 1920s.
0:40:09.840000 - 0:40:11.680000::Okay, I grab you.
0:40:11.680000 - 0:40:12.640000::Hey, okay.
0:40:12.640000 - 0:40:15.920000::And then I say this, you realize you just messed up right
0:40:15.920000 - 0:40:20.080000::mathematically because you had the curse, right?
0:40:20.080000 - 0:40:21.440000::Yes, the time's really good.
0:40:21.440000 - 0:40:22.920000::Just you.
0:40:22.920000 - 0:40:24.440000::Me and my whole family.
0:40:24.440000 - 0:40:25.320000::Yeah, all right.
0:40:25.320000 - 0:40:27.160000::Well, that screws up what I was going to say.
0:40:27.160000 - 0:40:28::Okay, I'm just me.
0:40:28 - 0:40:28.520000::Just me.
0:40:28.520000 - 0:40:29.520000::Just you.
0:40:29.520000 - 0:40:37.880000::Well, what you fucked up as like is by doing both me and Nate, because now I'm
0:40:37.880000 - 0:40:42.760000::presuming it's only affecting us half wise, whereas you were really stuck.
0:40:42.760000 - 0:40:47.240000::So now we have the ability to come back to earth for half the day and beat the shit out
0:40:47.240000 - 0:40:48.240000::of you.
0:40:48.240000 - 0:40:51.640000::And we'll just fucking trade off.
0:40:51.640000 - 0:40:55.120000::Would you guys go crazy though in the 20s if you went back in time?
0:40:55.120000 - 0:40:57.920000::Oh, can you imagine?
0:40:57.920000 - 0:41:02.240000::Let's just say, we're one and liquor.
0:41:02.240000 - 0:41:05.680000::Except back then it would be fucking ill.
0:41:05.680000 - 0:41:06.680000::Fucking ill.
0:41:06.680000 - 0:41:07.680000::Lickery.
0:41:07.680000 - 0:41:08.680000::Banana oil.
0:41:08.680000 - 0:41:09.680000::All right.
0:41:09.680000 - 0:41:16.720000::So that swords that might have been my most busted hypothetical of all time.
0:41:16.720000 - 0:41:17.720000::I didn't really think through it.
0:41:17.720000 - 0:41:22.680000::I was kind of winging it, but I just wanted to know.
0:41:22.680000 - 0:41:24.160000::Would you guys be impressed?
0:41:24.160000 - 0:41:25.160000::Would you guys be impressed?
0:41:25.160000 - 0:41:26.640000::That was just like a kidnapping.
0:41:26.800000 - 0:41:29.120000::I kidnapped you back to the different decade.
0:41:29.120000 - 0:41:30.400000::A time travel kidnap.
0:41:30.400000 - 0:41:31.400000::Yeah.
0:41:31.400000 - 0:41:34.480000::I mean, this is just what's going through my head all day.
0:41:34.480000 - 0:41:37.480000::Stories as such hypothetical scenarios.
0:41:37.480000 - 0:41:42.720000::I feel like we're at a deep enough in the podcast where anybody who I don't want to hear
0:41:42.720000 - 0:41:44.120000::this isn't listening anymore.
0:41:44.120000 - 0:41:47.360000::And I could say a kind of truthful, cringy story.
0:41:47.360000 - 0:41:48.360000::Say it.
0:41:48.360000 - 0:41:49.360000::To these.
0:41:49.360000 - 0:41:50.680000::This is where we just start getting.
0:41:50.680000 - 0:41:54.640000::If you just got to the last quarter of Joy Tactics now, and this is your first time
0:41:54.640000 - 0:41:56.160000::with us.
0:41:56.160000 - 0:41:58.720000::It kind of takes a hard fucking pivot.
0:41:58.720000 - 0:42:00.720000::We are naming names right now.
0:42:00.720000 - 0:42:05.240000::Oh, yeah, names were canceling people were telling us just we're not doing the craziest
0:42:05.240000 - 0:42:06.440000::gossip that you ever heard.
0:42:06.440000 - 0:42:10::And I don't want to welcome you to the last quarter of Joy Tactics right now because
0:42:10 - 0:42:11.400000::we're making this shit.
0:42:11.400000 - 0:42:13.560000::And you're not going to be disappointed.
0:42:13.560000 - 0:42:15.880000::And it's a sprint, by the way, because it's the end of the race.
0:42:15.880000 - 0:42:16.880000::We're going hard.
0:42:16.880000 - 0:42:17.880000::All right.
0:42:17.880000 - 0:42:18.880000::So here it is.
0:42:18.880000 - 0:42:22.240000::A embarrassing story sponsored by Jack Pinsinger.
0:42:22.240000 - 0:42:23.240000::Yep.
0:42:23.240000 - 0:42:26.200000::I was in college one time in North Carolina.
0:42:26.200000 - 0:42:30.160000::Didn't go to college for a year after high school took some community college classes
0:42:30.160000 - 0:42:31.160000::whenever.
0:42:31.160000 - 0:42:34.920000::Then I found out the Danny McBride went to college in North Carolina.
0:42:34.920000 - 0:42:40.520000::So I went to that college because that made sense to me.
0:42:40.520000 - 0:42:47.760000::Then the film Your Highness, hilarious film was screening at the place.
0:42:47.760000 - 0:42:48.760000::I miss all that.
0:42:48.760000 - 0:42:49.760000::Is that good?
0:42:49.760000 - 0:42:52::The Franco joint.
0:42:52 - 0:42:53::If you love it, you love it.
0:42:53 - 0:42:56.800000::But a lot of people didn't like it.
0:42:56.800000 - 0:42:57.800000::I'm really skipping it.
0:42:57.800000 - 0:42:58.800000::It was like it, too.
0:42:58.800000 - 0:43:02.760000::It was basically like a pineapple express.
0:43:02.760000 - 0:43:05.040000::Wasn't quite as good.
0:43:05.040000 - 0:43:06.760000::But it was more interesting.
0:43:06.760000 - 0:43:13.360000::Anyway, so they're screening it and who's doing the Q&A, but the man himself, the legend,
0:43:13.360000 - 0:43:14.360000::David Gordon Green.
0:43:14.360000 - 0:43:15.360000::Oh, yeah.
0:43:15.360000 - 0:43:17.640000::Oh, yeah, who went to the school as well.
0:43:17.640000 - 0:43:23.840000::And I was at the time I had kind of decided in my head, I am leaving this school.
0:43:23.840000 - 0:43:27.480000::I'm moving to Chicago to go do comedy.
0:43:27.480000 - 0:43:30.880000::And so I was like really trying to get reassurance.
0:43:30.880000 - 0:43:33.200000::And so I asked David Gordon Green.
0:43:33.200000 - 0:43:39.840000::I said, do you think it's important to take risks in life?
0:43:39.840000 - 0:43:41.840000::Wow.
0:43:41.840000 - 0:43:42.840000::Wow.
0:43:42.840000 - 0:43:47.600000::Because I wanted him to tell me, yes, basically you should drop out essentially.
0:43:47.600000 - 0:43:50::How old were you when you were S's?
0:43:50 - 0:43:55.440000::I was a sophomore, so I was 23.
0:43:55.440000 - 0:43:58.840000::I imagine you asking this with a backpack on.
0:43:58.840000 - 0:44:02.840000::I probably had like a good little suit, like button up.
0:44:02.840000 - 0:44:04.840000::You were looking like a full grown man.
0:44:04.840000 - 0:44:09.320000::I still don't look like a full grown man, but I'll tell you what.
0:44:09.320000 - 0:44:12.760000::Yeah, for those who also don't know, I was held back a couple times.
0:44:12.760000 - 0:44:14.320000::So I graduated high school and I was about 19.
0:44:14.320000 - 0:44:15.320000::No fault of your own.
0:44:15.320000 - 0:44:19.480000::And I basically almost graduated college when I was 24.
0:44:19.480000 - 0:44:20.480000::It's not a problem.
0:44:20.480000 - 0:44:22.600000::Okay, so what did he say?
0:44:22.600000 - 0:44:28.640000::He said something like so unremarkable and unmemorable.
0:44:28.640000 - 0:44:32.360000::Like I was looking for like an answer that was going to change the course of my life.
0:44:32.360000 - 0:44:37.040000::And he just said something along the lines like, yeah, man.
0:44:37.040000 - 0:44:38.040000::Of course.
0:44:38.040000 - 0:44:40.800000::Yeah, he always go to take risks.
0:44:40.800000 - 0:44:43.400000::Like something not even that kind of makes me.
0:44:43.400000 - 0:44:44.880000::Yeah, I'm like, well, here's the one.
0:44:44.880000 - 0:44:45.880000::There's that.
0:44:45.880000 - 0:44:47.240000::No, no, no, no, but here's the context.
0:44:47.240000 - 0:44:52.440000::David Gordon Green, he had been explaining that he is in the Throws of Hell because he
0:44:52.440000 - 0:44:56.880000::wants to make like good fucking movies, not just comedies and this and that.
0:44:56.880000 - 0:45:00::And he was trapped into making like he had to direct the sitter.

0:45:00 - 0:45:02.480000::with like Jonah Hill and fucking like,
0:45:02.480000 - 0:45:05.800000::just, it was like Rune, he was like not happy about.
0:45:05.800000 - 0:45:07.160000::And he was talking about that.
0:45:07.160000 - 0:45:08::Yeah.
0:45:08 - 0:45:09.160000::He was saying like, I don't wanna do this shit.
0:45:09.160000 - 0:45:10.280000::That's so interesting.
0:45:10.280000 - 0:45:11.600000::Wow.
0:45:11.600000 - 0:45:14.360000::Well, I think that's why a lot of their stuff is amazing
0:45:14.360000 - 0:45:18.920000::is because it's like, it's, I don't know,
0:45:18.920000 - 0:45:21.200000::it has like cinematic qualities in mind
0:45:21.200000 - 0:45:23.080000::when they're making their TV shows.
0:45:23.080000 - 0:45:23.920000::For real.
0:45:23.920000 - 0:45:24.920000::In movies, you know?
0:45:24.920000 - 0:45:25.760000::Dude, what?
0:45:25.760000 - 0:45:27.480000::So, there's some to it.
0:45:27.480000 - 0:45:28.480000::There's some big to it.
0:45:28.480000 - 0:45:29.320000::Obviously.
0:45:29.680000 - 0:45:31.480000::Watch an e-spounding down.
0:45:31.480000 - 0:45:35.040000::The way that they do, I hate to be so academic,
0:45:35.040000 - 0:45:36.840000::but I can't help it because I am an academic,
0:45:36.840000 - 0:45:37.840000::in my core.
0:45:37.840000 - 0:45:38.680000::Right, right.
0:45:38.680000 - 0:45:42.360000::They are so, their ability to do visual storytelling
0:45:42.360000 - 0:45:44.240000::as well as auditorial storytelling.
0:45:44.240000 - 0:45:46.600000::In the way that, if you watched this scene
0:45:46.600000 - 0:45:49.840000::in any other TV show on right now,
0:45:50.840000 - 0:45:53.680000::they would just never communicate these things this way
0:45:53.680000 - 0:45:55.600000::where all of a sudden they're kind of dipping
0:45:55.600000 - 0:45:57.440000::into a different genre
0:45:57.440000 - 0:46:00.680000::and doing camera movements that aren't normal for this,
0:46:00.680000 - 0:46:03.760000::just for one scene, just to kind of set something up
0:46:03.760000 - 0:46:06.800000::and add some flair and...
0:46:06.800000 - 0:46:09.040000::TV is so busted right now.
0:46:10.200000 - 0:46:12.160000::It's on the O-R.
0:46:12.160000 - 0:46:13.040000::It's in the O-R.
0:46:13.040000 - 0:46:16.880000::Can we get a shout out to the John Wilson finale?
0:46:16.880000 - 0:46:17.720000::That was a make-up.
0:46:17.720000 - 0:46:18.560000::Oh my.
0:46:18.560000 - 0:46:21.040000::That's a show that made me feel inspired of like,
0:46:21.040000 - 0:46:22.960000::okay, there's a new happening.
0:46:22.960000 - 0:46:25.160000::There's a new thing going on, you know what I mean?
0:46:25.160000 - 0:46:26::Yeah.
0:46:26.040000 - 0:46:27.560000::That's over.
0:46:27.560000 - 0:46:28.400000::Succession.
0:46:28.400000 - 0:46:29.840000::I'm like, what else do we got?
0:46:29.840000 - 0:46:32.840000::Well, you know, I have a theory.
0:46:32.840000 - 0:46:33.680000::What?
0:46:33.680000 - 0:46:37.720000::I have a theory that telemarketers and John Wilson,
0:46:37.720000 - 0:46:40.200000::we had those back-to-back on Max.
0:46:40.200000 - 0:46:42.640000::Yeah, that's the end of the era.
0:46:42.640000 - 0:46:45.400000::Friday we had John Wilson, how to do with John Wilson.
0:46:45.400000 - 0:46:48.040000::Then, Sundays we had telemarketers produced by Dan and Rick.
0:46:48.040000 - 0:46:49.320000::Only three parts.
0:46:49.320000 - 0:46:53.840000::And, you know, the safeties, okay?
0:46:53.840000 - 0:46:54.760000::Yeah, okay.
0:46:54.760000 - 0:46:58.440000::So, I think this was a siaop because the white boys
0:46:58.440000 - 0:47:00.600000::were planning something and they were trying to quell
0:47:00.600000 - 0:47:02.600000::some sort of white boy rebellion.
0:47:04 - 0:47:06.240000::They were keeping us at bay, you know what I'm saying?
0:47:06.240000 - 0:47:07.520000::What do you mean?
0:47:07.520000 - 0:47:08.720000::I don't fully understand what you mean.
0:47:08.720000 - 0:47:09.560000::Yeah, going on.
0:47:09.560000 - 0:47:12.080000::Just by distracting us with amazing television.
0:47:12.080000 - 0:47:13.600000::Oh.
0:47:13.600000 - 0:47:15.120000::Yeah, I do.
0:47:15.120000 - 0:47:16.920000::So, you're saying there's like something happening
0:47:16.920000 - 0:47:18.960000::in politics that we're not aware of?
0:47:18.960000 - 0:47:21.400000::It was just, I feel like there's a rumbling of like,
0:47:21.680000 - 0:47:24.120000::like some alternative, like Indie white boys
0:47:24.120000 - 0:47:25.720000::were cooking and planted.
0:47:25.720000 - 0:47:28.240000::There was some kind of revolt that was about to happen.
0:47:28.240000 - 0:47:29.280000::They predicted it and they were like,
0:47:29.280000 - 0:47:32.080000::we gotta give them what to take.
0:47:32.080000 - 0:47:34.520000::Oh, you're saying there was about to be like a mass shooting
0:47:34.520000 - 0:47:37.640000::and like they need all the like straight white boy,
0:47:37.640000 - 0:47:39.720000::like in cell adjacent guys to.
0:47:39.720000 - 0:47:41.720000::Yeah, I'm not saying mass shooting,
0:47:41.720000 - 0:47:43.880000::but like something was, something was cooking,
0:47:43.880000 - 0:47:45.520000::something was in the air, you know?
0:47:45.520000 - 0:47:47.680000::Like a January, like an alternative January,
0:47:47.680000 - 0:47:51.760000::in all in all white boy January six.
0:47:51.760000 - 0:47:53.040000::I dare you to riff on that.
0:47:53.040000 - 0:47:54.200000::I dare you.
0:47:54.200000 - 0:47:55.880000::I dare you to do that.
0:47:55.880000 - 0:47:58.640000::You know, I got a million things I can say right now
0:47:58.640000 - 0:48:01.600000::that would go more viral than anything
0:48:01.600000 - 0:48:02.760000::and anyways, ever done.
0:48:02.760000 - 0:48:04::January six.
0:48:04 - 0:48:07.760000::What's that for all January six?
0:48:07.760000 - 0:48:08.600000::Come on.
0:48:08.600000 - 0:48:10.960000::For your pink being at both.
0:48:10.960000 - 0:48:11.800000::All right.
0:48:11.800000 - 0:48:12.640000::Oh, yeah.
0:48:12.640000 - 0:48:13.480000::Oh, there you go.
0:48:13.480000 - 0:48:14.320000::Oh, shit.
0:48:14.320000 - 0:48:15.160000::All right.
0:48:15.160000 - 0:48:16.840000::All right.
0:48:16.840000 - 0:48:18.680000::So we are, we need some good TV.
0:48:18.680000 - 0:48:20.680000::It's gonna fall.
0:48:20.680000 - 0:48:25.080000::We need these studios at the fucking AMPTP
0:48:25.080000 - 0:48:28.920000::to stop doing what they're doing that so evil
0:48:28.920000 - 0:48:31::and take risks, okay?
0:48:31 - 0:48:31.840000::Yeah.
0:48:31.840000 - 0:48:32.840000::And take risks.
0:48:32.840000 - 0:48:33.880000::Listen to us.
0:48:33.880000 - 0:48:37.120000::The strike has gone on long enough
0:48:37.120000 - 0:48:39.960000::and they're waiting to, until we run out of homes,
0:48:39.960000 - 0:48:42.320000::until we all can't afford to our houses anymore.
0:48:42.320000 - 0:48:44.160000::None of us have houses, man.
0:48:44.160000 - 0:48:45.640000::We didn't have houses to begin with.
0:48:45.640000 - 0:48:47.040000::He who makes a beast out of himself
0:48:47.040000 - 0:48:49.160000::gets rid of the pain of being a man.
0:48:49.160000 - 0:48:50.680000::Oh, a Vengeance emphold.
0:48:50.680000 - 0:48:54.480000::Lele, lele, lele, lele, lele.
0:48:54.480000 - 0:48:58.120000::I don't think they made that up, but yes,
0:48:58.120000 - 0:48:59.920000::they use it as well.
0:48:59.920000 - 0:49:02.600000::But there are beastly pains.
0:49:02.600000 - 0:49:04.800000::There are beastly pains that men.
0:49:04.800000 - 0:49:05.960000::But I'm not a beast.
0:49:05.960000 - 0:49:08.440000::You get a whole new tear of pain.
0:49:08.440000 - 0:49:10.720000::I'm finding this out from Baldur's Gate Three
0:49:10.720000 - 0:49:12.360000::is that you think it's easier
0:49:12.360000 - 0:49:14.800000::because this is a different class or difference.
0:49:14.840000 - 0:49:16.040000::No, no, no.
0:49:16.040000 - 0:49:18.040000::Everybody has their own strengths and weaknesses.
0:49:18.040000 - 0:49:19.920000::And I'll tell you, beasts probably have pain
0:49:19.920000 - 0:49:22.720000::that would hurt badly.
0:49:22.720000 - 0:49:26.320000::Imagine getting a splinter if you're a fucking big ol' ogre.
0:49:26.320000 - 0:49:28.200000::You probably get the craziest splinter.
0:49:28.200000 - 0:49:29.600000::Yeah, it's just like, disgusting.
0:49:29.600000 - 0:49:31.440000::Ogres make me sick.
0:49:31.440000 - 0:49:33.200000::If you're a fucking salamiat ogre,
0:49:33.200000 - 0:49:35.040000::even shoot out, get a hit.
0:49:35.040000 - 0:49:36.040000::Drop off my line.
0:49:36.040000 - 0:49:38.160000::You don't mean that about Sreck, do you?
0:49:38.160000 - 0:49:40.640000::While Sreck is, you know, that's pretty good.
0:49:40.640000 - 0:49:42.680000::Yeah, that was pretty easy.
0:49:42.680000 - 0:49:43.880000::That was amazing.
0:49:43.880000 - 0:49:45.640000::Fuck what are we just talking about?
0:49:47.680000 - 0:49:48.680000::TV being good again.
0:49:48.680000 - 0:49:50.240000::This is maybe, for some reason,
0:49:50.240000 - 0:49:52.200000::this feels like one of the most unhinged episodes
0:49:52.200000 - 0:49:56.280000::we've had in a while in terms of topics.
0:49:56.280000 - 0:49:57.280000::Yeah, yeah.
0:49:57.280000 - 0:49:58.280000::Yeah, yeah.
0:49:59.480000 - 0:50:01.480000::So thanks for watching.

0:50:00 - 0:50:01.640000::to rock with us.
0:50:01.640000 - 0:50:04::Well, we got none of our minds at any series.
0:50:04 - 0:50:05.480000::And we got 10 minutes left.
0:50:06.640000 - 0:50:08.880000::Because, well, this is what I've been thinking about.
0:50:11.120000 - 0:50:13.600000::We need to be making, I've been thinking about
0:50:13.600000 - 0:50:17.800000::taking more financial risks.
0:50:17.800000 - 0:50:19.080000::I'm talking about money.
0:50:19.080000 - 0:50:20.920000::You worry me when you talk like this,
0:50:20.920000 - 0:50:22.320000::but, well, let's hear him out.
0:50:22.320000 - 0:50:23.160000::Well, let's hear him out.
0:50:23.160000 - 0:50:24.680000::Yeah, but keep going.
0:50:24.680000 - 0:50:28.560000::Every couple of months I have this deranged,
0:50:28.560000 - 0:50:33.560000::like, perception of money in a way that I just want to go do.
0:50:34.160000 - 0:50:36.520000::And I don't never go to casinos ever.
0:50:36.520000 - 0:50:37.520000::Okay.
0:50:37.520000 - 0:50:38.520000::I'm not like a gambler.
0:50:38.520000 - 0:50:39.680000::I never gamble.
0:50:39.680000 - 0:50:41.400000::I've only gambled a couple of times in my life.
0:50:41.400000 - 0:50:43.520000::One of them has been with you guys.
0:50:43.520000 - 0:50:48.520000::But I have this fucking feeling like I either want to put it
0:50:48.520000 - 0:50:49.920000::all on black.
0:50:49.920000 - 0:50:54.360000::Every fucking cent put it all on black at the roulette table

0:56:47.400000 - 0:56:49.120000::You guys have tried Bajo, right?
0:56:49.120000 - 0:56:51.320000::Bajo is just talking about Chinese liquor.

0:57:10.720000 - 0:57:12.760000::They soak stuff in it and then it now it's flavored
0:57:12.760000 - 0:57:13.800000::and it's delicious.
0:57:13.800000 - 0:57:16.800000::And they do the same at the Russian tea room
0:57:16.800000 - 0:57:19.360000::where they soak all that vodka and horseradish and deal
0:57:19.360000 - 0:57:20.200000::and lemon.
0:57:21.080000 - 0:57:23.080000::Now here's the opposite scenario.

0:57:43.640000 - 0:57:44.480000::Yeah.
0:57:44.480000 - 0:57:46.920000::And they had been soaked in whiskey for like a billion years
0:57:46.920000 - 0:57:48.480000::and it wasn't, you didn't drink the whiskey,
0:57:48.480000 - 0:57:51.800000::you got the apple and the eating,
0:57:51.800000 - 0:57:54.960000::like chewing and eating on something that purely tasted
0:57:54.960000 - 0:57:58.560000::and herded like liquor was one of the hardest things
0:57:58.560000 - 0:58:00.640000::I've ever had to eat.
0:58:00.640000 - 0:58:01.480000::It's not interesting.
0:58:01.480000 - 0:58:02.320000::I'm sorry you had to go through that.
0:58:02.320000 - 0:58:03.320000::That sounds gross.
0:58:03.320000 - 0:58:06.120000::Well, this is at a restaurant, at like a fancy restaurant.
0:58:06.120000 - 0:58:08.160000::You know what I'm realizing and wondering
0:58:08.160000 - 0:58:11.160000::is maybe they use those apples to flavor the stuff
0:58:11.160000 - 0:58:12.560000::and those things we're gonna get thrown out
0:58:12.560000 - 0:58:14.120000::and that's why we got them for free.
0:58:14.120000 - 0:58:17.120000::And we just, but they get you fucked up so we ate them.
0:58:17.960000 - 0:58:21.280000::We need to dedicate a whole episode to liquor
0:58:21.280000 - 0:58:23.560000::and liqueurs, cocktails.
0:58:23.560000 - 0:58:24.400000::That's true.
0:58:24.400000 - 0:58:26.800000::We have to do the get all fucked up episode.
0:58:26.800000 - 0:58:27.920000::Please.
0:58:27.920000 - 0:58:28.760000::Yeah.
0:58:28.760000 - 0:58:29.600000::We've done that.
0:58:29.600000 - 0:58:30.440000::No.
0:58:30.440000 - 0:58:32.080000::We've had to drink or do.
0:58:32.080000 - 0:58:34.560000::We should do power hour with liquor.
0:58:34.560000 - 0:58:37.920000::Oh, we could do it experimentally.
0:58:37.920000 - 0:58:38.760000::Wait, what's power hour?
0:58:38.760000 - 0:58:40.800000::Where you have six pot dogs and six beers
0:58:40.800000 - 0:58:43::and six pieces of the fun joints.
0:58:43 - 0:58:44::No power hour is like.
0:58:44 - 0:58:47.080000::He's a shot of beer every minute.
0:58:47.320000 - 0:58:49.480000::And by the end of an hour,
0:58:49.480000 - 0:58:52.280000::you have drank probably four beers.
0:58:52.280000 - 0:58:54.480000::That's about 60 ounces of beer.
0:58:54.480000 - 0:58:55.480000::A shot of beer.
0:58:55.480000 - 0:58:56.880000::Oh, more 75 ounces.
0:58:56.880000 - 0:58:58.720000::Wait a minute, four beers in an hour.
0:59:00.320000 - 0:59:02.720000::We should do a power hour, dude.
0:59:02.720000 - 0:59:06.320000::I'm saying that peanut butter, whiskey.
0:59:06.320000 - 0:59:07.480000::Why don't, what if we,
0:59:09.720000 - 0:59:12.360000::what if the most disgusting shit?
0:59:12.360000 - 0:59:13.960000::Watch your mouth.
0:59:13.960000 - 0:59:15::Watch your mouth.
0:59:15 - 0:59:17.040000::I just had peanut butter whiskey for the first time,
0:59:17.040000 - 0:59:19::shilled, but let me tell you,
0:59:19 - 0:59:22.360000::it was handed to me by two elders,
0:59:23.360000 - 0:59:25.240000::which made me,
0:59:25.240000 - 0:59:29.840000::like I feel like if I got this same shot handed to me
0:59:29.840000 - 0:59:31.440000::by a 19 year old,
0:59:31.440000 - 0:59:33.040000::I'd be like, this is fucking disgusting.
0:59:33.040000 - 0:59:33.880000::I don't feel like shit,
0:59:33.880000 - 0:59:36.080000::but because it was handed to me by two people
0:59:36.080000 - 0:59:38.960000::who's boat I was on, who I won't name,
0:59:38.960000 - 0:59:41.520000::and who were a little older than us.
0:59:41.520000 - 0:59:44.960000::Perhaps some of us know older than 55.
0:59:45.680000 - 0:59:48.120000::Somebody's parents, but they, you know what I'm saying?
0:59:48.120000 - 0:59:48.960000::Yeah.
0:59:48.960000 - 0:59:49.960000::And I thought it was fancy now.
0:59:49.960000 - 0:59:50.800000::It tastes good.
0:59:50.800000 - 0:59:51.640000::It tastes so good.
0:59:51.640000 - 0:59:52.480000::And I thought it was fancy.
0:59:52.480000 - 0:59:54.360000::And now you're saying that and I'm realizing it wasn't.
0:59:54.360000 - 0:59:59.840000::It reminds me of the guy that worked at my college liquor store.

1:00:00 - 1:00:05::and he looked like what's his name from Harry Potter,
1:00:05 - 1:00:06::the groundskeeper.
1:00:06 - 1:00:08::You know what I'm talking about?
1:00:08 - 1:00:09::Hagrid?
1:00:09 - 1:00:11::Not Hagrid.
1:00:11 - 1:00:13::He's the mean one.
1:00:13 - 1:00:16::And he had a long ass white hair and he talked like this.
1:00:16 - 1:00:19::And he talked to him one time and he was like,
1:00:19 - 1:00:21::I never drink any of this shit.
1:00:21 - 1:00:23::I haven't had a drink alcohol my entire life.
1:00:23 - 1:00:26::I remember thinking this is the saddest existence you work in a...
1:00:26 - 1:00:28::You're shredded by all this delicious liquor.
1:00:28 - 1:00:29::You never try to drop.
1:00:29 - 1:00:30::You know what I mean?
1:00:30 - 1:00:33::And you're looking at fake IDs all day and passing...
1:00:33 - 1:00:36::I think this guy must have passed by now.
1:00:36 - 1:00:38::Must have passed away by now.
1:00:38 - 1:00:41::You guys want to hear an epic college moment?
1:00:41 - 1:00:42::Yeah.
1:00:42 - 1:00:43::Drinking moment and that.
1:00:43 - 1:00:44::Constantly.
1:00:44 - 1:00:48::I went to Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio.
1:00:48 - 1:00:51::And this is one of those like party schools.
1:00:51 - 1:00:54::Like people go to the school to party.
1:00:54 - 1:00:57::And that's like above education.
1:00:57 - 1:01:02::And there was a night where probably the...
1:01:02 - 1:01:05::Maybe the most I've ever drank in my life was this night.
1:01:05 - 1:01:06::And we were up.
1:01:06 - 1:01:10::I'm talking all night long into the morning.
1:01:10 - 1:01:11::Like the...
1:01:11 - 1:01:13::Into like seven A.M.
1:01:13 - 1:01:14::Drinking.
1:01:14 - 1:01:15::It was like...
1:01:15 - 1:01:16::Luda.
1:01:16 - 1:01:17::It was fucked up.
1:01:17 - 1:01:19::I'm like disgusted even thinking of it right now.
1:01:19 - 1:01:23::So we were drinking till seven in the morning out on my front lawn.
1:01:23 - 1:01:24::I was there.
1:01:24 - 1:01:26::And a guy was walking to class.
1:01:26 - 1:01:31::Like an early class in the morning and saw us like drinking alcohol.
1:01:31 - 1:01:35::And then he went to class and we were still drinking.
1:01:35 - 1:01:39::Like he came back from the class and he had a six pack and he gave it to us.
1:01:39 - 1:01:41::And he was like, keep going guys.
1:01:41 - 1:01:43::Oh my God.
1:01:43 - 1:01:44::That is legend.
1:01:44 - 1:01:46::That is level ten.
1:01:46 - 1:01:49::And Stacy's mom epic bunk bed moment.
1:01:49 - 1:01:50::That's like a...
1:01:50 - 1:01:51::A bird christseller.
1:01:51 - 1:01:53::Yeah, that's natural.
1:01:53 - 1:01:54::That is a beast.
1:01:54 - 1:01:55::That is...
1:01:55 - 1:01:56::Oh, I'm thinking of that.
1:01:56 - 1:01:57::I'm thinking of that.
1:01:57 - 1:01:58::I'm just thinking of that.
1:01:58 - 1:01:59::I was going to go to college.
1:01:59 - 1:02:01::Give me some beer now.
1:02:01 - 1:02:04::Dude, let's have a fucking beer.
1:02:04 - 1:02:05::You know what?
1:02:05 - 1:02:07::Weirdly enough liquor and cocktails.
1:02:07 - 1:02:09::It's fading away from me a little bit.
1:02:09 - 1:02:10::I'm not as interested in...
1:02:10 - 1:02:11::No.
1:02:11 - 1:02:12::No, no, no, no, no.
1:02:12 - 1:02:15::That's just because you get literally bed ridden for the last two and a half weeks.
1:02:15 - 1:02:16::Beer.
1:02:16 - 1:02:17::I'm back on beer.
1:02:17 - 1:02:18::Oh.
1:02:18 - 1:02:19::Then light beers.
1:02:19 - 1:02:20::Then a big club.
1:02:20 - 1:02:21::Ultra.
1:02:21 - 1:02:22::That's what I like.
1:02:22 - 1:02:23::Dude, they have...
1:02:23 - 1:02:24::They have...
1:02:24 - 1:02:25::Madelo came out with their...
1:02:25 - 1:02:26::They're super platinum light.
1:02:26 - 1:02:27::Yeah.
1:02:27 - 1:02:28::Did you see that?
1:02:28 - 1:02:29::Yeah.
1:02:29 - 1:02:30::I mean, I'm just so excited to say that.
1:02:30 - 1:02:31::I just heard about it from somebody.
1:02:31 - 1:02:32::I just heard about it from somebody.
1:02:32 - 1:02:33::But I haven't tried that yet.
1:02:33 - 1:02:34::That sounds good.
1:02:34 - 1:02:36::I was so jacked to saw that in a target.
1:02:36 - 1:02:37::I was like, oh, shit.
1:02:37 - 1:02:38::We gotta be happy to see that.
1:02:38 - 1:02:41::We can drink Madelo's light style, like the Michelin Ultra style.
1:02:41 - 1:02:51::Just like when we were in Marseys Vineyard and we were cooking that final steak taco dinner
1:02:51 - 1:02:56::and I had about four Michelin Ultra's while I was cooking.
1:02:56 - 1:02:57::And that is the best I've ever...
1:02:57 - 1:02:59::And I'm listening to my music.
1:02:59 - 1:03:00::I'm playing it because I'm cooking.
1:03:00 - 1:03:02::I get to play the music.
1:03:02 - 1:03:03::Oh, la la.
1:03:03 - 1:03:05::That is heaven to me.
1:03:05 - 1:03:07::Chopin, Dyson, beer.
1:03:07 - 1:03:11::Well, I got those three tall boys that you bought.
1:03:11 - 1:03:14::They're still in my fridge, are you?
1:03:14 - 1:03:18::That was the funniest alcohol purchase I've seen in a very long time.
1:03:18 - 1:03:19::Okay.
1:03:19 - 1:03:21::If you guys listen to the busted love episode,
1:03:21 - 1:03:23::probably the worst episode we've had.
1:03:23 - 1:03:28::Maybe the worst, and by the way, I think I said, but I fell asleep about 30 seconds afterwards
1:03:28 - 1:03:30::and was snoring in the bed.
1:03:30 - 1:03:35::I had bought two, three packs of giant tall boys of Madelo.
1:03:35 - 1:03:38::Six tall boys thinking that like, oh, this night might get crazy.
1:03:38 - 1:03:40::Yeah, I was thinking we might have some fun tonight.
1:03:40 - 1:03:44::And we had a, this was at midnight and we had a flight at seven in the morning.
1:03:44 - 1:03:46::And we had about two sips each.
1:03:46 - 1:03:48::Nate, you had the most, man.
1:03:48 - 1:03:50::I know, you're being half a lot of beer, right?
1:03:50 - 1:03:51::Yeah.
1:03:51 - 1:03:55::Yeah, but I couldn't even, couldn't even do it.
1:03:55 - 1:03:58::So there's still out there waiting for us in LA.
1:03:58 - 1:03:59::Speak love.
1:03:59 - 1:04:00::Love.
1:04:00 - 1:04:01::LA.
1:04:01 - 1:04:02::Don't forget.
1:04:02 - 1:04:03::Get your tickets.
1:04:03 - 1:04:04::You want to see typewriter?
1:04:04 - 1:04:05::I want to see some special guests.
1:04:05 - 1:04:06::I want to see some special guests.
1:04:06 - 1:04:07::They're incoming.
1:04:07 - 1:04:09::We can't drop them quite yet, but we'll drop their names.
1:04:09 - 1:04:10::It's your tickets now.
1:04:10 - 1:04:14::Yeah, we can't say who it is, but we can say one of them is Sarah Sherman.
1:04:14 - 1:04:15::And then the rest of them won't work on it.
1:04:15 - 1:04:16::We can't say who it is.
1:04:16 - 1:04:17::We can't reveal it.
1:04:17 - 1:04:21::That's Sarah Sherman, but we'll let you guys know when we drop the lineup.
1:04:21 - 1:04:22::Good job.
1:04:22 - 1:04:23::Yeah, right now though.
1:04:23 - 1:04:24::It's gracious.
1:04:24 - 1:04:27::And September 25th, we're going to be at the Bell House.
1:04:27 - 1:04:31::And we're having a residency in Slovenia.
1:04:31 - 1:04:34::We're going to be there for all of 2024.
1:04:34 - 1:04:35::That's right.
1:04:35 - 1:04:36::That's right.
1:04:36 - 1:04:38::And it's a way to get out of some prison time.
1:04:38 - 1:04:39::We know that we're tax sheltering.
1:04:39 - 1:04:40::Yeah.
1:04:40 - 1:04:42::Yeah.
1:04:42 - 1:04:43::Yeah.
1:04:43 - 1:04:44::This has been the risk episode.
1:04:44 - 1:04:45::Listen.
1:04:45 - 1:04:46::Fuck.
1:04:46 - 1:04:47::Did I just have something else I remember based on?
1:04:47 - 1:04:48::Well, we got to say what gave us joy.
1:04:48 - 1:04:49::Oh, my bad.
1:04:49 - 1:04:50::Good.
1:04:50 - 1:04:51::God.
1:04:51 - 1:04:52::Let me say something real quick.
1:04:52 - 1:04:53::Just on risk.
1:04:53 - 1:04:54::Just one more thing.
1:04:54 - 1:04:55::I don't.
1:04:55 - 1:04:57::My therapist told me this.
1:04:57 - 1:04:58::Okay.
1:04:58 - 1:04:59::And.
1:04:59 - 1:05:00::Well,

1:05:00 - 1:05:03.060000::Anyways, he said that some one of his patients,
1:05:03.060000 - 1:05:06.160000::he was like, you're pursuing your dreams
1:05:06.160000 - 1:05:09.300000::and like, you know, that's awesome, whatever.
1:05:09.300000 - 1:05:11.480000::But he was like, I have patients that,
1:05:11.480000 - 1:05:14.520000::that nothing is in there.
1:05:14.520000 - 1:05:16.880000::I was like talking about how there are things in my way
1:05:16.880000 - 1:05:18.720000::to like pursuing what I wanna do.
1:05:18.720000 - 1:05:21.220000::Like there's people that have to say yes to you.
1:05:21.220000 - 1:05:22.480000::There's gatekeepers, you know,
1:05:22.480000 - 1:05:27.480000::that have to say yes to me for my dream to be fully actualized.
1:05:27.480000 - 1:05:29.360000::Which, you know, it's true and not true at the same time.
1:05:29.360000 - 1:05:32.140000::Anyways, he was like, I have patients who would,
1:05:33.520000 - 1:05:35.920000::who there's nothing stopping them
1:05:35.920000 - 1:05:38.160000::from doing what they're like,
1:05:38.160000 - 1:05:39.480000::carpenters, something like that
1:05:39.480000 - 1:05:41.160000::and they wanna sing or something.
1:05:41.160000 - 1:05:42.280000::They wanna be a singer.
1:05:42.280000 - 1:05:46.640000::And nothing is stopping them from taking that leap
1:05:46.640000 - 1:05:48.520000::and becoming a singer.
1:05:48.520000 - 1:05:50.360000::And I was like, can you tell them
1:05:50.360000 - 1:05:53.640000::that I would be so jealous of them
1:05:53.640000 - 1:05:55.960000::that there is nothing stopping you from doing it?
1:05:55.960000 - 1:05:58::And why would you not do it?
1:05:58 - 1:06:00.680000::So I hope this is just that extra push.
1:06:00.680000 - 1:06:02::If there's somebody out there
1:06:02 - 1:06:06.400000::who wants to pursue your dream, do it now.
1:06:06.400000 - 1:06:08.080000::And I'll just comment on that.
1:06:08.080000 - 1:06:11.200000::I think that's beautiful, but have a safety net.
1:06:11.200000 - 1:06:13.960000::Have a fucking do not just go out there
1:06:13.960000 - 1:06:15.680000::and pursue with nothing underneath here
1:06:15.680000 - 1:06:18.080000::because you are going to fail miserably.
1:06:18.080000 - 1:06:20.720000::Get a day job that can be paid pretty good money
1:06:20.720000 - 1:06:22.080000::and do this shit on the side
1:06:22.080000 - 1:06:24.040000::until you can't do that day job anymore.
1:06:24.040000 - 1:06:25.480000::That's what I've done.
1:06:25.480000 - 1:06:28.240000::And it's worth wonders for me until I got laid off.
1:06:31.160000 - 1:06:33.080000::You're saying the darkest room.
1:06:33.080000 - 1:06:37.520000::So to be completely honest Nate,
1:06:37.520000 - 1:06:40::I don't understand what you said.
1:06:40 - 1:06:41.360000::And I want you to say that.
1:06:41.360000 - 1:06:42.200000::No, no, no, no.
1:06:42.200000 - 1:06:43.040000::And that's fine.
1:06:43.040000 - 1:06:43.880000::And that's fine.
1:06:43.880000 - 1:06:45.200000::We can just move on.
1:06:45.200000 - 1:06:46.200000::Yeah.
1:06:46.200000 - 1:06:49.240000::Wait, so he was saying what?
1:06:49.240000 - 1:06:50.680000::That people would be jealous.
1:06:50.680000 - 1:06:51.440000::What?
1:06:51.440000 - 1:06:53::I was okay.
1:06:53 - 1:06:54.320000::Let me, you know, let's just move on.
1:06:54.320000 - 1:06:55.160000::It's just not everything.
1:06:55.480000 - 1:06:58.560000::There's a lot of people with my level of comprehension skills
1:06:58.560000 - 1:06:59.960000::that didn't understand as well.
1:06:59.960000 - 1:07:01.120000::I'll try and break it down.
1:07:01.120000 - 1:07:01.960000::I got you.
1:07:01.960000 - 1:07:02.800000::I got you.
1:07:02.800000 - 1:07:03.640000::I got you.
1:07:03.640000 - 1:07:04.880000::That's embarrassing now.
1:07:04.880000 - 1:07:06.640000::So I was okay.
1:07:06.640000 - 1:07:07.480000::All right.
1:07:07.480000 - 1:07:12.960000::So there, I was telling him about how there are obstructions.
1:07:12.960000 - 1:07:16.840000::There are obstacles in my way to achieving my dream.
1:07:16.840000 - 1:07:18.840000::Okay, you with me, Jack, you just moved out of the frame.
1:07:18.840000 - 1:07:19.680000::I'm listening, man.
1:07:19.680000 - 1:07:20.520000::I'm listening.
1:07:20.520000 - 1:07:21.720000::Okay, you're just laying down all this.
1:07:21.720000 - 1:07:23.520000::I just have things in my way.
1:07:23.520000 - 1:07:27.800000::And he was like, I have clients who there's nothing stopping them.
1:07:27.800000 - 1:07:29.680000::There's nothing in their way from achieving their dream.
1:07:29.680000 - 1:07:32.280000::So they're carpenter, but then they want to be a,
1:07:32.280000 - 1:07:33.360000::being a singer, there's no one to be able to.
1:07:33.360000 - 1:07:35.480000::That's the example I gave just off-coping.
1:07:35.480000 - 1:07:37.320000::But they're still goal.
1:07:37.320000 - 1:07:39.720000::How could there be nothing stopping anybody from achieving
1:07:39.720000 - 1:07:42.640000::their dream unless their dream is, you get just,
1:07:42.640000 - 1:07:44.720000::their dream is to go sing on the sidewalk?
1:07:44.720000 - 1:07:45.560000::What do you mean?
1:07:45.560000 - 1:07:46.400000::Exactly.
1:07:46.400000 - 1:07:47.520000::Like, let's just say it's a simple thing.
1:07:47.520000 - 1:07:50.760000::They just want to be like, go to karaoke and have friends.
1:07:50.760000 - 1:07:51.760000::I see what you're saying.
1:07:51.840000 - 1:07:55.600000::There are people who are afraid to even allow themselves
1:07:55.600000 - 1:07:58.280000::to indulge in their interests.
1:07:58.280000 - 1:07:59.600000::Exactly.
1:07:59.600000 - 1:08:00.600000::Heard.
1:08:00.600000 - 1:08:01.600000::Heard.
1:08:01.600000 - 1:08:02.600000::Okay.
1:08:02.600000 - 1:08:03.600000::Yes, chef.
1:08:03.600000 - 1:08:04.600000::The bear.
1:08:04.600000 - 1:08:05.600000::So that's it.
1:08:05.600000 - 1:08:06.600000::Yeah, you got it.
1:08:06.600000 - 1:08:07.600000::And we worked it.
1:08:07.600000 - 1:08:09.920000::Okay, so then, so then, so then, as you were saying,
1:08:09.920000 - 1:08:11.520000::oh, I couldn't agree more.
1:08:11.520000 - 1:08:13.680000::Uh, yeah.
1:08:13.680000 - 1:08:15.200000::So go out there and fuck.
1:08:15.200000 - 1:08:17.040000::And, and don't have a backup.
1:08:17.040000 - 1:08:18.080000::I'm going to counter Eric's thing.
1:08:18.080000 - 1:08:19.240000::Don't have any backup.
1:08:19.240000 - 1:08:20.240000::No.
1:08:20.240000 - 1:08:21.240000::Go all in.
1:08:21.240000 - 1:08:22.800000::Put it all on black.
1:08:22.800000 - 1:08:26.600000::Fucking lose your, lose your relationships, lose friends,
1:08:26.600000 - 1:08:28.840000::lose your life into your passion.
1:08:28.840000 - 1:08:29.960000::Because go all in.
1:08:29.960000 - 1:08:31.920000::Because if you don't, it's not going to work out.
1:08:31.920000 - 1:08:33.160000::Get a job in that car.
1:08:33.160000 - 1:08:35.920000::If you have that backup plan, it ain't going to work out for you.
1:08:35.920000 - 1:08:36.760000::Sorry.
1:08:36.760000 - 1:08:39.280000::Listen, get a job that you're willing, never have a job
1:08:39.280000 - 1:08:40.440000::that you're not willing to quit.
1:08:40.440000 - 1:08:42.400000::Be willing to live alone and know how to be lonely
1:08:42.400000 - 1:08:43.400000::for the rest of your life.
1:08:43.400000 - 1:08:45.800000::A set up is set back for a comeback, even if you get whatever.
1:08:45.800000 - 1:08:46.800000::And by the way,
1:08:52.080000 - 1:08:54.080000::I can't remember.
1:08:54.080000 - 1:08:57.080000::Well, I'll say this sometimes the mold is sometimes
1:08:57.080000 - 1:09:00.800000::the most beautiful image is a mattress on the ground
1:09:00.800000 - 1:09:02.320000::in a new city.
1:09:02.320000 - 1:09:05.760000::Uh, no belongings, just the clothes on your back
1:09:05.760000 - 1:09:08.320000::in a suitcase and a new job.
1:09:08.320000 - 1:09:09.320000::You know what I mean?
1:09:09.320000 - 1:09:12.160000::That's let yourself think that's beautiful
1:09:12.160000 - 1:09:13.040000::because that is beautiful.
1:09:13.040000 - 1:09:16.040000::You're taking that's a risk starting over.
1:09:17.040000 - 1:09:18.040000::Yeah.
1:09:18.040000 - 1:09:18.840000::So what gave me joy this week?
1:09:18.840000 - 1:09:21.200000::Well, we directed one of the most viral music videos
1:09:21.360000 - 1:09:24.840000::of all time for a bank called Hotline TNT, me and Jack.
1:09:24.840000 - 1:09:27.080000::Nate would have been in it if he was here.
1:09:27.080000 - 1:09:28.480000::Caleb Pitts was in it.
1:09:28.480000 - 1:09:30.080000::Jill O'Connell was in it.
1:09:30.080000 - 1:09:31.360000::And we had an amazing time.
1:09:31.360000 - 1:09:33.400000::So go check that out now.
1:09:36.200000 - 1:09:40.080000::And what gave me joy this week was a,
1:09:40.080000 - 1:09:42.760000::there's a green salsa at,
1:09:42.760000 - 1:09:46.720000::ah, I want to try.
1:09:46.720000 - 1:09:48.880000::I went to salsa and beer.
1:09:48.880000 - 1:09:51.160000::No, no, you did.
1:09:51.160000 - 1:09:52.440000::Yeah, you're going next week.
1:09:52.440000 - 1:09:53.840000::Oh my God.
1:09:53.840000 - 1:09:58::And, uh, and I was just eating the fuck out of the green salsa
1:09:58 - 1:10:00::there and the orange.

1:10:00 - 1:10:10.680000::salsa and I was just like, I mean, I feel like me and Jane, we just went together and we got the fajitas and it was just we had the perfect like I feel like I just like
1:10:11.920000 - 1:10:19.060000::Perfectly didn't get too full because that's a problem there. You get it too fucking full. You got to split this
1:10:19.060000 - 1:10:30.340000::Tecatecas fajitas with someone. We split the Guadalajara fajitas sizzling fajitas. We split them because it's so much and even then I was full
1:10:30.340000 - 1:10:36.780000::I couldn't even eat the whole fucking my half of it with the chips with the bean dip on the side get out of town
1:10:37.780000 - 1:10:45.380000::I'm not kidding mine is too well under 40 bucks. We're talking our under with tip 50 way I tip under 700
1:10:45.380000 - 1:10:55.620000::$50. All right. The way I tip yeah, but for you all it's under 50 bucks for if you're doing that if you're doing a neighbor on style, you know what I'm saying?
1:10:55.620000 - 1:11:03.220000::Oh Nate, do you know that there's a margarita bar that's opening in in Ridgewood that's gonna I think gonna be open when you're here.
1:11:03.220000 - 1:11:08.340000::Dude and is that and it's owned by Rollos. I met the owner Rollos, didn't I?
1:11:09.460000 - 1:11:11.460000::Did you at your birthday? That's what my birthday
1:11:12.180000 - 1:11:19.620000::And I tried making a joke and I could tell that he wasn't down so I pulled those parachute on it. You try to make your joke about Rollos?
1:11:19.620000 - 1:11:26.540000::I did yeah, I was all fucked up as my birthday and I was walking into a joke. I was gonna start roasting him for making a
1:11:27.020000 - 1:11:33.700000::kind of bougie ass burgers and then I stopped because I could see he wasn't really wanting to joke about that his passion.
1:11:33.700000 - 1:11:41.260000::I went to Rollos last night had a wonderful time. I love Rollos every time I go. I love their take on the burger. It's different.
1:11:42.220000 - 1:11:49.260000::Um, what gave me joy Jack? What gave me joy besides Rollos is uh, listen.
1:11:50.780000 - 1:11:59.580000::What gave me joy was spending the holiday Labor Day shout out to people who enjoy that is going on my friend's parents boat.
1:12:00.140000 - 1:12:02.140000::This was lovely.
1:12:02.140000 - 1:12:07.020000::A little thorn my best friend Eric was in there. Sorry. I was sick. I was sick. I could make it.
1:12:07.500000 - 1:12:11.820000::But this was so lovely. I'd never spent a day on a boat and this was like a beautiful
1:12:12.620000 - 1:12:16.700000::fucking boat. You go tubing? We didn't go tubing, but we did go
1:12:17.180000 - 1:12:22.940000::print some paddle boards out and it was a boat that's like a boat you dream of where it's like it has this kind of
1:12:23.580000 - 1:12:30.860000::70s like mustardy kind of energy and colors and vibe and stuff and the speakers were all on there and there's like a grill and a
1:12:30.860000 - 1:12:38.860000::grill and a stove and all the stuff built in. Was there a bathroom? There's a downstairs with a bed and a bath and a shower.
1:12:40.300000 - 1:12:44.620000::And my friend I won't say who, but let's just say they're going to be a guest and their name is Sarah. They're going to be a nice
1:12:44.620000 - 1:12:49.820000::tie-brother. But let's just say they took a shit on the fucking boat and it fucking clogged the toilet.
1:12:49.820000 - 1:12:56.860000::And then they scooped up all the fucking toilet paper and toilet water to try to unclog it and we were all hanging out in the water right behind the boat.
1:12:56.940000 - 1:13:02.380000::And she was like laughing and through, I don't know, I have to be able to say this.
1:13:02.380000 - 1:13:09.820000::And she threw a bucket of toilet water in the water where we were all fucking hanging out and everybody like got back on the boat and it was like
1:13:10.460000 - 1:13:12.700000::was the one of most psycho things I've seen.
1:13:13.580000 - 1:13:16.940000::I feel like that's something like a fan of hers would guess that she's up to.
1:13:16.940000 - 1:13:23.180000::Yeah, it's not in the way that you think. Like it's not in like the Sarah like Sarah is a you know, I don't want to out her.
1:13:23.340000 - 1:13:26.860000::But you know, she's actually quite squeamish and quite normal.
1:13:28.460000 - 1:13:36.860000::But this so it wasn't a gross thing. It was like she was like blacking out in like humiliation and laughter and just like couldn't hear us and was being in you know.
1:13:37.100000 - 1:13:44.780000::But at the end of the day, my thing that gave me joy is the people who I was with on that boat.
1:13:45.580000 - 1:13:52.620000::It was so lovely to get to peer into another family and feel somebody else's home.
1:13:53.260000 - 1:13:54.460000::In this cold world.
1:13:57.100000 - 1:13:59.100000::The inhuman, the earth of noble natures.
1:13:59.900000 - 1:14:04.140000::There are no fun families out there when I when I when I meet a fun family.
1:14:04.380000 - 1:14:06.540000::Go. That is just the best man.
1:14:06.540000 - 1:14:13.500000::These motherfuckers. Listen, the three of one of the first times I met Sarah Sherman's dad, I wrestled him on the floor.
1:14:14.220000 - 1:14:16.220000::That hard wood floor.
1:14:17.820000 - 1:14:18.780000::That's awesome.
1:14:18.780000 - 1:14:20.380000::I want to be a dad like that.
1:14:21.100000 - 1:14:21.980000::There's a state.
1:14:21.980000 - 1:14:23.180000::These dudes in shape.
1:14:23.340000 - 1:14:25.020000::This dude is in good shape.
1:14:26.060000 - 1:14:27.980000::We will stay in shape when we have our children.
1:14:28.460000 - 1:14:30.220000::I'm in bad shape right now.
1:14:31.660000 - 1:14:32.380000::Because I've been sick.
1:14:32.380000 - 1:14:33.420000::We need motivation.
1:14:33.420000 - 1:14:34.220000::Motivate us.
1:14:34.220000 - 1:14:35.820000::Send us the end of motivation.
1:14:35.820000 - 1:14:36.700000::Clearly, I need it.
1:14:36.700000 - 1:14:41.100000::We all need inspiring messages because it's what keeps us going.
1:14:41.100000 - 1:14:43.980000::We need some motivation from the fans right now.
1:14:43.980000 - 1:14:49.900000::DM us your most sentimental shit ever to keep us going and rocking and staying
1:14:50.780000 - 1:14:53.420000::staying very creative in these times.
1:14:54.300000 - 1:14:57.180000::Let us know in the comments what risk you took this week.
1:14:58.700000 - 1:14:59.820000::Medical or otherwise.

1:15:00 - 1:15:01.640000::All right, everybody.
1:15:01.640000 - 1:15:05::Thank you so much for listening to joy techniques.
