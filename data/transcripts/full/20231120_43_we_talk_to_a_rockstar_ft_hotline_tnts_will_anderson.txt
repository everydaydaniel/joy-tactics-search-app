0:05:37.900000 - 0:05:39.400000::We're basically local legends.
0:05:39.400000 - 0:05:43.100000::People know we're about to hit it, but we haven't hit the big time yet.
0:05:43.100000 - 0:05:45.300000::You know, but you kind of...
0:05:45.300000 - 0:05:46.600000::You kind of just did.
0:05:46.600000 - 0:05:48.300000::You got a lot of shard man records.
0:05:48.300000 - 0:05:49.300000::You guys...
0:05:49.300000 - 0:05:53.600000::Yeah, I mean, it's been kind of like a foot race with the tactics and howling.
0:05:53.600000 - 0:05:55.600000::Kind of like I'm trying to beat you guys to the prize.
0:05:55.700000 - 0:05:58.700000::I mean, they're at the same time, like kind of simultaneous.
0:05:58.700000 - 0:06:01.700000::But I remember like when we had our first meeting by the video.
0:06:01.700000 - 0:06:02.700000::Yes.
0:06:02.700000 - 0:06:04.700000::And you said it, you were like, can you feel it?
0:06:04.700000 - 0:06:06.200000::Like something's coming.
0:06:06.200000 - 0:06:07.200000::And it's...
0:06:07.200000 - 0:06:08.200000::Something's coming for you.
0:06:08.200000 - 0:06:09.200000::I didn't feel it.
0:06:09.200000 - 0:06:10.200000::And you felt it before I did.
0:06:10.200000 - 0:06:13.700000::I did have that kind of magic, like that woman from the Matrix.
0:06:13.700000 - 0:06:14.700000::Yeah, I was an Oracle.
0:06:14.700000 - 0:06:15.700000::Catwoman?
0:06:15.700000 - 0:06:17.700000::Oh, the Oracle dude.
0:06:17.700000 - 0:06:18.700000::Yeah.
0:06:18.700000 - 0:06:20.700000::You're more of the...
0:06:20.700000 - 0:06:24.700000::You're more of the not like this lady from Matrix.
0:06:24.800000 - 0:06:25.700000::Switch.
0:06:25.700000 - 0:06:26.800000::Switch.
0:06:26.800000 - 0:06:27.800000::Not like this.
0:06:27.800000 - 0:06:28.800000::Switch.
0:06:28.800000 - 0:06:30.800000::How do I not have any Matrix drops in here?
0:06:30.800000 - 0:06:31.800000::That's like a...
0:06:31.800000 - 0:06:32.800000::That's a problem.
0:06:32.800000 - 0:06:33.800000::That's an over say.
0:06:33.800000 - 0:06:38::When Mouse got killed by Mr. Smith, it broke me.
0:06:38 - 0:06:39::Remember that?
0:06:39 - 0:06:41::Oh my God.
0:06:41 - 0:06:43::All those Mr. Smiths.

0:06:50 - 0:06:51::It was recorded.
0:06:51 - 0:06:53::Yeah, that was like...
0:06:53.100000 - 0:06:56.100000::I thought I was like, that's as good as tech is ever going to get.
0:06:56.100000 - 0:06:58.600000::Like seeing all the Smiths come out like that.
0:06:58.600000 - 0:06:59.600000::Oh, well, good.
0:06:59.600000 - 0:07:00.600000::That was great.
0:07:00.600000 - 0:07:01.600000::Well, they can't...
0:07:01.600000 - 0:07:02.600000::Yeah.
0:07:02.600000 - 0:07:05.200000::I remember that song from Matrix.
0:07:05.200000 - 0:07:08.800000::I think it was Matrix Reloaded even though the song's called Revolution.
0:07:08.800000 - 0:07:11.300000::But there's a band called POD, Payable on Death.
0:07:11.300000 - 0:07:12.800000::Do you remember this band, Will?
0:07:12.800000 - 0:07:14.800000::This is my first concert, actually.
0:07:14.800000 - 0:07:15.800000::Are you kidding me?
0:07:15.800000 - 0:07:19.800000::Well, I've told people my favorite concert is first concert of the two things.
0:07:19.800000 - 0:07:20.800000::Is...
0:07:20.800000 - 0:07:22.600000::I went to a lot of Christian music festivals first.
0:07:22.600000 - 0:07:25.200000::And POD is a Christian band.
0:07:25.200000 - 0:07:26.200000::Yes.
0:07:26.200000 - 0:07:28.700000::Technically, that was like the first show I saw.
0:07:28.700000 - 0:07:29.700000::POD.
0:07:29.700000 - 0:07:31.200000::You know that song, Revolution.
0:07:31.200000 - 0:07:32.200000::What's there?
0:07:32.200000 - 0:07:33.200000::What?
0:07:33.200000 - 0:07:35.200000::Did somebody say a revolution?
0:07:35.200000 - 0:07:38.200000::Or is it all in my head?
0:07:38.200000 - 0:07:39.200000::That's in...
0:07:39.200000 - 0:07:40.200000::Reloaded.
0:07:40.200000 - 0:07:42::That's in Reloaded or Revolution.
0:07:42 - 0:07:45.200000::It's what they blast when they're in, well, what's it called Zion?
0:07:45.200000 - 0:07:48.200000::We don't got to get into why it's called Zion, but we'll see.
0:07:48.200000 - 0:07:49.200000::We're gonna see a clear that one.
0:07:49.200000 - 0:07:51.200000::By the way, Eric, why is it called that?
0:07:51.200000 - 0:07:53.800000::Phil doesn't want you in Hotline TNT.

0:08:02.800000 - 0:08:04.800000::Dude, don't put words in his mouth.
0:08:04.800000 - 0:08:06.800000::I'm fucking speak for himself.
0:08:06.800000 - 0:08:09.800000::No, but QOD is important to me in a lot of ways.

0:08:55.800000 - 0:08:57.800000::Well, it was pretty much quiet until...
0:08:57.800000 - 0:08:59.800000::It was quiet until TNT.
0:08:59.800000 - 0:09:04.800000::So y'all are basically revitalizing, like, I don't know.
0:09:04.800000 - 0:09:07.400000::Because running was all going on in Afghanistan.
0:09:07.400000 - 0:09:10::Everybody was like, so reoccupied with that.
0:09:10 - 0:09:12.200000::I know you were over there in and out.
0:09:12.200000 - 0:09:16.200000::Not necessarily for military reasons, but it is interesting.
0:09:16.400000 - 0:09:17.400000::Yeah.
0:09:17.400000 - 0:09:18.400000::It was a draft.
0:09:18.400000 - 0:09:19.400000::It was a draft.
0:09:19.400000 - 0:09:22.400000::Because everybody's still in terms of new metal,
0:09:22.400000 - 0:09:24.400000::I'm definitely still rocking with all the stuff that I was
0:09:24.400000 - 0:09:27.400000::rocking with from back then, but I didn't realize how deep it went.
0:09:27.400000 - 0:09:29.400000::No, it's really deep.
0:09:29.400000 - 0:09:32.400000::And you should, I don't want to give those guys too much free cloud.
0:09:32.400000 - 0:09:35.400000::But Rochcoach has a couple of good episodes in there.
0:09:35.400000 - 0:09:36.400000::Yeah.

0:09:51.600000 - 0:09:52.600000::I got saved at a Skillet show.
0:09:52.600000 - 0:09:55.800000::Like they like everyone raise their hands and like go out and
0:09:55.800000 - 0:09:57.800000::always use ministers out there.
0:09:57.800000 - 0:10:00::What were you going through that you needed saving?

0:10:00 - 0:10:06.620000::Nothing nothing law. Yeah, I was I was really making you feel like yeah, you need it badly, but the kid is crazy
0:10:06.620000 - 0:10:08.620000::What's that one song?
0:10:08.620000 - 0:10:10.620000::Re am I thinking of the right man?
0:10:11.020000 - 0:10:14.520000::But now I want to live my life
0:10:15.420000 - 0:10:17.420000::Can't remember I don't know that one
0:10:18.420000 - 0:10:20.920000::You can I love them, but I don't remember any songs
0:10:21.720000 - 0:10:29.480000::What if hotline TNT became every you had like just a live stream where everybody went into a Joel
0:10:29.480000 - 0:10:36.920000::Olstein style church and everybody got fucking hands laid on them safe and you became a fuck you did the reverse Katy Perry
0:10:37.100000 - 0:10:40.720000::Where you guys become a fucking broken Christian?
0:10:41.720000 - 0:10:43.720000::Well, I guess Kanye did that but
0:10:48.480000 - 0:10:52.360000::Like are they super loud for you by the way? I don't want to overpower. No, it's perfect
0:10:52.360000 - 0:10:54.880000::Yeah, right. It's perfect in the pockets
0:10:54.880000 - 0:10:57.320000::You can kind of hear them, but I don't mean open pockets
0:10:57.320000 - 0:11:04.720000::You guys would become rich beyond your wildest dreams if you want evangelical tours of Africa playing massive million crowd
0:11:04.720000 - 0:11:07.640000::It's already I had a meeting with the agents. It's already in talks
0:11:10.080000 - 0:11:14.760000::Were you on pitch for refreshing the page at midnight to see if best new music hit?
0:11:15.560000 - 0:11:21.600000::I really don't think it was gonna happen. We were in London when yeah the review hit and I knew I had heard
0:11:22.120000 - 0:11:26.520000::The review is gonna come out on release day. Yeah, which is that's like a good sign
0:11:26.520000 - 0:11:32::I guess I was told that's a good sign. It's a Friday. Oh, so you know it's gonna be sitting there all weekend
0:11:32 - 0:11:33.960000::Mm-hmm, I was like all right
0:11:33.960000 - 0:11:37.040000::This is looking kind of good, but I'm not gonna count my chickens
0:11:37.040000 - 0:11:43.320000::Yeah, they gave us a little feature like a couple weeks before and I was like that's also a good sign
0:11:43.560000 - 0:11:45.560000::But I bet you'd like give us like
0:11:46.160000 - 0:11:52.160000::8.0 no best new music, you know, I do that now on no, I thought that was oh, oh, oh, you got it
0:11:52.560000 - 0:11:58.920000::Because I'm just like a good score, but no stamp. Yeah, hmm because sometimes I just give that all black 8.0
0:11:58.920000 - 0:12:03.200000::It's not the best new music, but it's fucking quality. That was like my expectation at the top
0:12:03.520000 - 0:12:08.440000::You got me and then yeah, go ahead. Do you feel like that has like
0:12:09.280000 - 0:12:15.520000::Kind of changed some things with the best new because I remember when I was in high school if something got like best new music
0:12:15.680000 - 0:12:21.940000::It was like that band was like skyrocketed into like they're they're fucking gonna be
0:12:22.520000 - 0:12:28.140000::Every festival this year like that was how I found music, but I feel like now
0:12:28.840000 - 0:12:35.620000::There's not that it's like like lesser or anything like that. I just feel like there's so many new ways to find music that like
0:12:36.160000 - 0:12:41.960000::It's I don't know is that it is like getting best music at pitchfork still like a a
0:12:42.680000 - 0:12:43.720000::like
0:12:43.720000 - 0:12:46.360000::Huge boost to a band or
0:12:46.360000 - 0:12:48.360000::Disrespectful kind of question
0:12:49.240000 - 0:12:51.240000::I'm just curious
0:12:51.240000 - 0:12:54.640000::You said we're not doing the soft questions here. I'm not
0:12:54.920000 - 0:12:55.920000::Right, right, right?
0:12:55.920000 - 0:13:02.280000::Well, but high TNT's also being pumped into this Spotify algorithm heavily. It's on if you look at the new
0:13:02.280000 - 0:13:07.140000::They were just in a new era. So I'm saying no, like I think it is a big deal
0:13:07.140000 - 0:13:11.080000::I mean as you said, it's you know, pitchfork isn't quite the cultural like
0:13:11.960000 - 0:13:14.240000::What is it Mount Rushmore that it used to be?
0:13:14.240000 - 0:13:20.600000::We're outside, you know MCV all not even I don't know whatever the new Rolling Stone is I think they've
0:13:21.600000 - 0:13:27.200000::They're not quite as epic as they used to be because people find out I will be very fucking careful right now
0:13:30.440000 - 0:13:32.280000::Act like you're podcasting but then
0:13:33.280000 - 0:13:38.600000::You fucking take them out check for weapons now watch watch. He's gonna dismantle all right
0:13:39.960000 - 0:13:44.200000::That's a one of my guitar players. He's he's just so it's
0:13:44.240000 - 0:13:48.880000::Another rocker. I think he went to the gym by TV. I actually did you oh he goes to evolve
0:13:51.880000 - 0:13:55.300000::Planet fitness. He says oh he's gotta start hitting evolve and red
0:13:55.300000 - 0:13:58.620000::That's not a good time to interrupt something little something so
0:14:04.840000 - 0:14:06.840000::Some tension
0:14:06.840000 - 0:14:08.840000::I'm dead
0:14:10.360000 - 0:14:13.640000::Pitchfork is still a big deal and it was it was a big deal when it
0:14:14.840000 - 0:14:16.840000::Something disconnected
0:14:16.840000 - 0:14:18.360000::Getting some notifications
0:14:18.360000 - 0:14:23.240000::Pitchfork's still a big deal. I think people find it about music through like TikTok and Spotify and shit now
0:14:23.240000 - 0:14:26.660000::So it's like there's a lot more ways to blow up
0:14:27.680000 - 0:14:33.920000::So who are the who are some of the sad fucking pieces of shit that you that are like looking at highline tea and tea going like
0:14:33.920000 - 0:14:37::Mother fuckers they got this shit is it like Jason D'Rulo
0:14:41.520000 - 0:14:43.800000::The hate was already there before the review drafts
0:14:43.800000 - 0:14:50.120000::But you really you really need the hate to get to get to that point though. I wouldn't be here. I wouldn't be here help hate
0:14:51.120000 - 0:14:53.120000::And it does feel me for sure
0:14:53.120000 - 0:14:55.120000::I can tell
0:14:55.920000 - 0:15:00.040000::For some of my these dudes like Anakin Skywalker full of fucking hate but a lot of potential

0:15:00 - 0:15:06.600000::literally. I mean now that the 8.4 is out there's just like none of you guys can

0:20:21.440000 - 0:20:23.440000::That is what Jack was listening to.
0:20:23.440000 - 0:20:24.680000::No question.
0:20:24.680000 - 0:20:27.160000::Oh, I wasn't, I mean, I was,
0:20:27.160000 - 0:20:29::I was making my own music videos
0:20:29 - 0:20:31::and I was just going to be a musician
0:20:31 - 0:20:33.080000::for Maccom or when his shit was coming out,
0:20:33.080000 - 0:20:35::wings, I want a fly, can you remember that?
0:20:35 - 0:20:37.280000::He was the first person to introduce me to sneakers.
0:20:37.280000 - 0:20:38.200000::What a guy.
0:20:38.200000 - 0:20:40.800000::Well, I mean, and then the music videos continued.
0:20:40.800000 - 0:20:42.480000::Like, this thing we did, like,
0:20:42.480000 - 0:20:44.480000::I didn't know what it was going to turn into.
0:20:44.480000 - 0:20:47.960000::Will, do you know that instead of going to college,
0:20:47.960000 - 0:20:49.960000::I directed rap videos in Virginia?
0:20:49.960000 - 0:20:51.080000::I wasn't sure if you were serious,
0:20:51.080000 - 0:20:52.920000::but I think I saw some about it.
0:20:52.920000 - 0:20:53.680000::All right.
0:20:53.680000 - 0:20:54.720000::I'm fucking serious.
0:20:54.720000 - 0:20:55.480000::OK.
0:20:55.480000 - 0:20:57.160000::So just, you know, we have to mention that.
0:20:57.160000 - 0:20:58.680000::In case you were wondering,
0:20:58.680000 - 0:21:01.200000::we have to mention the fucking, the music video,
0:21:01.200000 - 0:21:02.880000::you guys directed, which I mean,
0:21:02.880000 - 0:21:05.480000::I wasn't, you didn't fly me out for that,
0:21:05.480000 - 0:21:07.880000::but like, I really enjoyed watching it
0:21:07.880000 - 0:21:10.520000::when it came out on YouTube, just kind of watching from afar.
0:21:10.520000 - 0:21:11.040000::Yeah.
0:21:11.040000 - 0:21:15.640000::But what was it like to work with Eric and Jack
0:21:15.640000 - 0:21:20.840000::as directors, as sort of artistic directors?
0:21:20.840000 - 0:21:21.600000::Yeah.
0:21:21.600000 - 0:21:23.200000::What was that like to be on set?
0:21:23.200000 - 0:21:27.720000::Because I've heard that they can be quite aggressive
0:21:27.720000 - 0:21:32.120000::and violent and sort of uneasy to be around.
0:21:32.120000 - 0:21:34.440000::But I just don't, I just want to know
0:21:34.440000 - 0:21:38.280000::from your perspective, what was it like to be in that video
0:21:38.280000 - 0:21:39.800000::and part of that process?
0:21:39.800000 - 0:21:41.520000::It was, it was a nightmare, but it's
0:21:41.520000 - 0:21:43.520000::when I didn't want to wake up from it.
0:21:43.520000 - 0:21:44.520000::It was so.
0:21:44.520000 - 0:21:45.320000::Wow.
0:21:45.320000 - 0:21:46.240000::That's beautiful.
0:21:46.240000 - 0:21:46.920000::We used to.
0:21:46.920000 - 0:21:48.080000::It was really, it was great.
0:21:48.080000 - 0:21:50.720000::I mean, we were just, all, everyone in the band
0:21:50.720000 - 0:21:52.240000::was a fan of all y'all.
0:21:52.240000 - 0:21:54.760000::And I really didn't think it was even going to happen.
0:21:54.760000 - 0:21:57.040000::I was just like, I think I'd slowly
0:21:57.040000 - 0:22:00.160000::like work my way into like Eric's social world a little bit,
0:22:00.160000 - 0:22:02.600000::kind of like trying to like, dude, everyone doing music
0:22:02.600000 - 0:22:03.120000::video.
0:22:03.120000 - 0:22:05.040000::He was like, actually, yeah.
0:22:05.040000 - 0:22:06.760000::But I still don't think it was going to happen.
0:22:06.760000 - 0:22:09.480000::And then I started throwing the third man money out
0:22:09.480000 - 0:22:10.240000::to that you guys.
0:22:10.240000 - 0:22:12.640000::And yeah, once the money showed up,
0:22:12.640000 - 0:22:16.640000::she was just a white gun volks.
0:22:16.640000 - 0:22:17.960000::Yeah, a little bit behind the process.
0:22:17.960000 - 0:22:21.840000::Mr. White, you can't make pizza without a hot oven, right?
0:22:21.840000 - 0:22:23.240000::It needs to be hot, needs to be fired,
0:22:23.240000 - 0:22:25.080000::needs some people got to get burned.
0:22:25.080000 - 0:22:26.800000::And so we basically, yeah, we rented
0:22:26.800000 - 0:22:29.520000::this apartment out in New Jersey.
0:22:29.520000 - 0:22:32.440000::And we had y'all just play this song for hours and hours
0:22:32.440000 - 0:22:32.960000::and hours.
0:22:32.960000 - 0:22:34.960000::And you were like, stop, man, I got my fucking figures
0:22:34.960000 - 0:22:36.880000::are bleeding, shredding down the fucking guitar.
0:22:36.880000 - 0:22:39.480000::Like people are quitting the band live in real time.
0:22:39.480000 - 0:22:41.560000::And we just push and push and push.
0:22:41.560000 - 0:22:42.800000::And I feel like it paid off.
0:22:42.800000 - 0:22:45.680000::I mean, it's a cultural phenomenon now, at this point.
0:22:45.680000 - 0:22:46.240000::Literally.
0:22:46.240000 - 0:22:49::It really, but that moment we're singing with you
0:22:49 - 0:22:50.720000::at the end of the video.
0:22:50.720000 - 0:22:53.080000::I mean, if anybody's listening to this,
0:22:53.080000 - 0:22:53.880000::that's seen the video.
0:22:53.880000 - 0:22:57.240000::There's a point where Jack and I are singing along
0:22:57.240000 - 0:22:58.760000::with Will into the mic.
0:22:58.760000 - 0:23:01.880000::And that is the hardest of broken.
0:23:01.880000 - 0:23:05.160000::We had to redo that take so many times because I was asked.
0:23:05.160000 - 0:23:07.880000::I want to see the crowd singing so earnestly.
0:23:07.880000 - 0:23:09.320000::Is Kevin Whiteley?
0:23:09.320000 - 0:23:11.840000::Our boy Kevin, who shot and edited it.
0:23:11.840000 - 0:23:13.240000::Shout out to Kevin.
0:23:13.240000 - 0:23:14.160000::The best.
0:23:14.160000 - 0:23:17.280000::Yeah, he's like your neighbor by a few blocks, I believe.
0:23:17.280000 - 0:23:18.280000::Yeah.
0:23:18.280000 - 0:23:19::Kevin goat.
0:23:19 - 0:23:22.120000::He, he was dying.
0:23:22.120000 - 0:23:26.600000::And every time I call him, he was laughing his ass off.
0:23:26.600000 - 0:23:28.400000::That's, that's takes a great.
0:23:28.400000 - 0:23:29.400000::Give it up for Kevin.
0:23:29.400000 - 0:23:30.400000::Give it up.
0:23:30.400000 - 0:23:32.320000::And you're working with Kevin on some, aren't you, Jack?
0:23:32.320000 - 0:23:33.320000::I am.
0:23:33.320000 - 0:23:35.280000::Let's just say, I don't want to say anything.
0:23:35.280000 - 0:23:38.280000::But if you've heard of something called the video magazine,
0:23:38.280000 - 0:23:39.280000::say no more, say no more.
0:23:39.280000 - 0:23:41.280000::Oh, I didn't hear what this was saying.
0:23:41.280000 - 0:23:42.280000::Say no more, say no more.
0:23:42.280000 - 0:23:44.240000::I want to know what's going on.
0:23:44.240000 - 0:23:46::If you can, but if you can't, this is all good.
0:23:46 - 0:23:47.520000::Oh, all right, all right.
0:23:47.520000 - 0:23:49.480000::Basically, Jack, Jack, plug it.
0:23:49.480000 - 0:23:51.040000::I need to start plugging now.
0:23:51.040000 - 0:23:51.560000::I told you.
0:23:51.560000 - 0:23:55.880000::So back in the day, I had a series on YouTube called
0:23:55.880000 - 0:23:59.680000::The I Love Comedy Video Magazine, where it was basically
0:23:59.680000 - 0:24:05.960000::almost like a Ali G style character driven sketch experience.
0:24:05.960000 - 0:24:09::But back then, when I made it, it sucked.
0:24:09 - 0:24:12.360000::So what I'm doing is remounting this series.
0:24:12.360000 - 0:24:15.320000::I've taken some years off in the hyperbolic chamber,
0:24:15.320000 - 0:24:18.040000::or whatever it's called, Dragon Ball Z style.
0:24:18.040000 - 0:24:19.440000::I've gotten really strong.
0:24:19.440000 - 0:24:22.360000::Now I'm coming back out, basically,
0:24:22.360000 - 0:24:25.400000::to demolish Frieza, in a sense.
0:24:25.400000 - 0:24:27.720000::And so December 9, I'm going to be doing a live version
0:24:27.720000 - 0:24:29.800000::of that show as well, taping some segments for it
0:24:29.800000 - 0:24:32.040000::to then go into the final product.
0:24:35.080000 - 0:24:37.840000::Do you have a sound effect that you could play to the cat?
0:24:37.840000 - 0:24:40.120000::Right.
0:24:40.120000 - 0:24:41.720000::Right.
0:24:41.720000 - 0:24:44.040000::I was, no, I heard the cryogenic freezing.
0:24:44.040000 - 0:24:45.520000::I was going, Dr. Evil.

0:43:22.220000 - 0:43:30.180000::That's a good question. So I'm kind of trying to place it historically about where Lincoln Park was and where Jay Z
0:43:31.180000 - 0:43:36.740000::Because I was Jay Z was kind of like he wasn't tip top yet. I don't think or was he?

0:43:42.040000 - 0:43:45.620000::I feel like yeah, and then he was he had been hot and then I was okay
0:43:45.620000 - 0:43:46.620000::He was kind of back and down
0:43:46.620000 - 0:43:48.620000::Lincoln Park was like

0:50:29.300000 - 0:50:32.580000::I was scared that fuck out of me when that happened.
0:50:32.580000 - 0:50:34.580000::I was so unsettled by that incident.
0:50:34.580000 - 0:50:37.580000::I don't want to talk about it.
0:50:37.580000 - 0:50:39.660000::I thought it was fake, for sure.
0:50:39.660000 - 0:50:41.820000::I got a DM right after it happened.
0:50:41.820000 - 0:50:44.140000::It was green screen?
0:50:44.140000 - 0:50:47.700000::I thought it was AI, but I thought it was AI too.
0:50:47.700000 - 0:50:49.340000::AI.
0:50:49.340000 - 0:50:52.420000::Well speaking of Will Smith, Will Smith is one of the most
0:50:52.420000 - 0:50:54.700000::famous people to ever live on the planet.
0:50:54.700000 - 0:50:58.140000::And you see what fame kind of does to a person.
0:50:58.140000 - 0:51:00.260000::You get them at level.
0:51:00.260000 - 0:51:04.660000::I feel like you're on your way up to be one of these musicians
0:51:04.660000 - 0:51:07.220000::that is a legendary status.
0:51:07.220000 - 0:51:09.540000::And we all know what happens to these musicians.
0:51:09.540000 - 0:51:10.980000::They lose their fucking mind.
0:51:10.980000 - 0:51:11.500000::Be careful.
0:51:11.500000 - 0:51:12.460000::Be crazy.
0:51:12.460000 - 0:51:13.620000::They fucking go.
0:51:13.620000 - 0:51:15.460000::They lose themselves.
0:51:15.460000 - 0:51:18.460000::So what are you doing to protect yourself from that?
0:51:18.460000 - 0:51:20.300000::Can you protect yourself from that?
0:51:20.300000 - 0:51:22.700000::Or do you just have to let the fame wash over you
0:51:22.700000 - 0:51:25.180000::and become that beast that monster?
0:51:25.180000 - 0:51:26.020000::Yeah.
0:51:26.020000 - 0:51:27.300000::What am I doing to prevent it?
0:51:27.300000 - 0:51:28.460000::Absolutely nothing.
0:51:28.460000 - 0:51:29.460000::I'm well-being.
0:51:29.460000 - 0:51:30.460000::Wow.
0:51:30.460000 - 0:51:31.460000::I think that's the good.
0:51:31.460000 - 0:51:32.460000::That's good.
0:51:32.460000 - 0:51:35.580000::Smell it whole and just kind of like just cruise.
0:51:35.580000 - 0:51:37.700000::And that's what I'm trying to do.
0:51:37.700000 - 0:51:40.140000::You're making a beast out of yourself.
0:51:40.140000 - 0:51:41.660000::It's always there.
0:51:41.660000 - 0:51:42.820000::It was always there.
0:51:42.820000 - 0:51:43.660000::Like seventh grade.
0:51:43.660000 - 0:51:45.140000::I'm doing the Jimmy H. World song.
0:51:45.140000 - 0:51:47.740000::It's like the seventh grade I saw.
0:51:47.740000 - 0:51:49.020000::What was coming?
0:51:49.020000 - 0:51:51.980000::Which musician would you smack if they were disrespecting
0:51:51.980000 - 0:51:53.380000::your wife at the Grammys?
0:51:53.380000 - 0:51:56.980000::And I was a comedian.
0:51:56.980000 - 0:51:58.340000::So we go think that's right.
0:51:58.340000 - 0:51:59.500000::They weren't even the same.
0:51:59.500000 - 0:52:02.580000::A comedian who's my analog in the comedy world.
0:52:02.580000 - 0:52:03.420000::Right.
0:52:03.420000 - 0:52:04.260000::David Cross.
0:52:04.260000 - 0:52:06.060000::Would you smack the fuck out of David Cross?
0:52:06.060000 - 0:52:07.740000::If he was going off on your ass.
0:52:07.740000 - 0:52:10.860000::I think I'm trying to think of who else.
0:52:10.860000 - 0:52:12.020000::Mikey Day maybe?
0:52:12.020000 - 0:52:14.140000::Oh, I could see that.
0:52:14.140000 - 0:52:15.140000::Oh, he would not.
0:52:15.140000 - 0:52:16.860000::He'd be a dead fucking smack in the end.
0:52:16.860000 - 0:52:17.660000::That would be a death.
0:52:17.660000 - 0:52:19.820000::You know, they were like, you could have killed Chris Rock.
0:52:19.820000 - 0:52:23.140000::If Mikey Day hit that same Will Smith slap,
0:52:23.140000 - 0:52:25.020000::he'd be fucking I'll tell you what,
0:52:25.020000 - 0:52:26.700000::I guess I know it wouldn't have the best straight man
0:52:26.700000 - 0:52:28.060000::on the planet right now.
0:52:28.060000 - 0:52:28.900000::I don't think so.
0:52:28.900000 - 0:52:29.740000::They have a dead one.
0:52:29.740000 - 0:52:30.740000::I don't think so.
0:52:30.740000 - 0:52:34.180000::Well, realistically, I think that comedian would be Eric
0:52:34.180000 - 0:52:37.500000::because they kind of like Chris and I would never
0:52:37.500000 - 0:52:38.660000::break out loyalty.
0:52:38.660000 - 0:52:39.980000::You need to hear this.
0:52:39.980000 - 0:52:42.380000::Eric wouldn't do that.
0:52:42.380000 - 0:52:45.860000::No, I'm saying you're going to smack.
0:52:45.860000 - 0:52:47.180000::I wouldn't cross the physical crack.
0:52:47.180000 - 0:52:48.940000::Never say never because they're just saying that.
0:52:48.940000 - 0:52:53.620000::I just think I encourage you to consider this reality
0:52:53.620000 - 0:52:56.260000::and prepare yourself for it because I think Chris Rock
0:52:56.260000 - 0:52:58.460000::and Will Smith probably felt this exact same way
0:52:58.460000 - 0:52:59.620000::back in the 90s, right?
0:52:59.620000 - 0:53:02.140000::Oh, right.
0:53:02.140000 - 0:53:03.980000::That's what Joy-to-Actix is all about.
0:53:03.980000 - 0:53:05.900000::Diving deeper into stuff like this.
0:53:05.900000 - 0:53:06.420000::Yeah, wow.
0:53:06.420000 - 0:53:09.860000::So what we're saying is fame does, Kerr, listen,
0:53:09.860000 - 0:53:12.580000::I do not want to become corrupted.
0:53:12.580000 - 0:53:16.020000::That's the last thing I want, but I know it's coming for me.
0:53:16.020000 - 0:53:17.100000::It's coming for all of us.
0:53:17.100000 - 0:53:19.460000::I no matter who can hold out the longest.
0:53:19.460000 - 0:53:20.460000::We have no choice.
0:53:20.460000 - 0:53:23.580000::Why is it so fun to have four rising stars?
0:53:23.620000 - 0:53:25.740000::On the same, the same as Zoom.
0:53:25.740000 - 0:53:28.260000::Because it's so fun.
0:53:28.260000 - 0:53:29.260000::We're here.
0:53:29.260000 - 0:53:30.420000::We're here.
0:53:30.420000 - 0:53:31.580000::Go.
0:53:31.580000 - 0:53:33.700000::Oh, we miss you.
0:53:33.700000 - 0:53:35.220000::We do miss you.
0:53:35.220000 - 0:53:39.260000::Yeah, that was a fucking devastating loss.
0:53:39.260000 - 0:53:40.060000::He played the Joker.
0:53:40.060000 - 0:53:42.780000::Will, we like to end every single one of our podcasts
0:53:42.780000 - 0:53:45.100000::with what gave us joy that week.
0:53:45.100000 - 0:53:47.820000::I'm sure you're being fucking inundated with joy left
0:53:47.820000 - 0:53:49.020000::and right.
0:53:49.020000 - 0:53:51.420000::Can you pick out one thing in the last week or month
0:53:51.420000 - 0:53:55.140000::that has filled your ass with joy?
0:53:55.140000 - 0:53:56.500000::I should have prepared for this.
0:53:56.500000 - 0:53:57.500000::Because I know.
0:53:57.500000 - 0:53:59.020000::Why don't we go first and then we'll get to you
0:53:59.020000 - 0:53:59.860000::and you can.
0:53:59.860000 - 0:54:01.220000::Yeah, yeah, yeah.
0:54:01.220000 - 0:54:02.220000::Yeah.
0:54:02.220000 - 0:54:03.420000::OK.
0:54:03.420000 - 0:54:04.500000::OK.
0:54:04.500000 - 0:54:07.460000::Nate, what gave you joy?
0:54:07.460000 - 0:54:11.100000::Sorry, my audio cut out.
0:54:11.100000 - 0:54:12.020000::I could do it.
0:54:12.020000 - 0:54:12.500000::I could do it.
0:54:12.500000 - 0:54:12.820000::I could do it.
0:54:12.820000 - 0:54:14.260000::I could do it.
0:54:14.260000 - 0:54:15.940000::This is a smooth segment every time.
0:54:15.940000 - 0:54:21.100000::So what gave me joy is the monthly show.
0:54:21.100000 - 0:54:22.660000::I don't give a fuckology.
0:54:22.660000 - 0:54:24.380000::It's a show that Eric Rayland, myself,
0:54:24.380000 - 0:54:25.820000::host in Brooklyn.
0:54:25.820000 - 0:54:29.300000::And last night I did something amazing,
0:54:29.300000 - 0:54:32.060000::something I have never done on stage before, which
0:54:32.060000 - 0:54:33.500000::is that I broke.
0:54:33.500000 - 0:54:35.340000::And I broke so hard that I actually
0:54:35.340000 - 0:54:36.820000::had to leave the stage.
0:54:36.820000 - 0:54:39.100000::And it was amazing.
0:54:39.100000 - 0:54:42.980000::The house was like just, they couldn't believe what they were
0:54:42.980000 - 0:54:45.380000::witnessing was like seeing Bob Dylan play the flute.
0:54:45.380000 - 0:54:48.580000::It was like, this is once in a lifetime thing.
0:54:48.580000 - 0:54:50.740000::It did look like a mental break for a second.
0:54:50.740000 - 0:54:53.140000::I was watching the audience.
0:54:53.140000 - 0:54:55.300000::That's right.
0:54:55.300000 - 0:55:01.100000::I did think this is a genuine laughing fit.

0:55:00 - 0:55:00.840000::Yeah.
0:55:01.800000 - 0:55:03.480000::And it had no justification.
0:55:03.480000 - 0:55:08.320000::I think maybe I had eaten this restaurant beforehand
0:55:08.320000 - 0:55:09.720000::and I wasn't feeling too good.
0:55:09.720000 - 0:55:10.880000::But that gave me joy, man.
0:55:10.880000 - 0:55:15.880000::It was kind of having a mental breakdown on stage, yo.
0:55:19 - 0:55:22.280000::Okay, I'll give mine congratulations, by the way,
0:55:22.280000 - 0:55:23.120000::on the show last night.
0:55:23.120000 - 0:55:25.320000::Oh, we can get a little sound effect here.
0:55:26.120000 - 0:55:27.120000::Um.
0:55:27.120000 - 0:55:28.120000::Oh,
0:55:28.120000 - 0:55:29.640000::oh,
0:55:29.640000 - 0:55:31.040000::what's this?
0:55:31.040000 - 0:55:31.880000::What's this?
0:55:31.880000 - 0:55:34.040000::Think, think, think, think, think,
0:55:34.040000 - 0:55:35.840000::enjoy tactics.
0:55:35.840000 - 0:55:36.960000::What's been going on with me?
0:55:36.960000 - 0:55:38.520000::Well, I'm listening to a new audio book
0:55:38.520000 - 0:55:40.880000::while I'm walking my dog and doing the dishes.
0:55:40.880000 - 0:55:44.160000::And it's called the Midnight Library.
0:55:44.160000 - 0:55:49.160000::And it's kind of a mom's book club type book.
0:55:50.360000 - 0:55:53.440000::And it's read by Carrie Mulligan, member her.
0:55:53.440000 - 0:55:56.080000::And it's about a woman who's at her wits end
0:55:56.080000 - 0:55:59.200000::and takes too many pills and goes to sleep.
0:55:59.200000 - 0:56:00.040000::You know what that means?
0:56:00.040000 - 0:56:01.360000::She tried to end her life.
0:56:01.360000 - 0:56:04.760000::And she ends up in something called the Midnight Library.
0:56:05.920000 - 0:56:07.520000::And what the Midnight Library is,
0:56:07.520000 - 0:56:09.080000::is there's millions of books.
0:56:09.080000 - 0:56:12.120000::And every book contains the life that you would have
0:56:12.120000 - 0:56:14.600000::if you made just one different choice.
0:56:14.600000 - 0:56:16.640000::So some choices are small, the life's there's someone,
0:56:16.640000 - 0:56:18.400000::some choices are big.
0:56:18.400000 - 0:56:21.560000::And basically just making me think,
0:56:21.560000 - 0:56:23.480000::I can't tell about choices in my life.
0:56:23.480000 - 0:56:26.120000::And it's an amazing experience.
0:56:26.120000 - 0:56:29.200000::And so I want to give it up to audible.com
0:56:29.200000 - 0:56:32.240000::for putting that in my presence.
0:56:32.240000 - 0:56:33.720000::Thank you, everybody.
0:56:33.720000 - 0:56:34.720000::Wow.
0:56:34.720000 - 0:56:36.440000::I'm just a reminder audio books are not
0:56:36.440000 - 0:56:38.720000::don't count as books that you read.
0:56:38.720000 - 0:56:39.880000::That's a throwback.
0:56:39.880000 - 0:56:41.080000::We kind of argued that.
0:56:41.080000 - 0:56:42.960000::Yeah, what do you think about that, Will?
0:56:42.960000 - 0:56:45.160000::I also, I don't, I agree.
0:56:45.160000 - 0:56:46.520000::I can't do audio books.
0:56:46.520000 - 0:56:49.280000::I've tried and I just kind of fall asleep with the wheel
0:56:49.280000 - 0:56:50.080000::every time.
0:56:50.080000 - 0:56:51.080000::Yeah.
0:56:51.080000 - 0:56:53.360000::You know, they definitely don't count as like a book.
0:56:53.360000 - 0:56:54.920000::Like if somebody's like, how many books have you read
0:56:54.920000 - 0:56:55.760000::this year?
0:56:55.760000 - 0:56:56.600000::And they say eight.
0:56:56.600000 - 0:56:58.400000::And then you're like, OK, they're, and then they're like,
0:56:58.400000 - 0:56:59.600000::they're all audio books.
0:56:59.600000 - 0:57:01.280000::You'd be like, so you didn't read a book.
0:57:01.280000 - 0:57:03.400000::So but what if someone says, I read physically
0:57:03.400000 - 0:57:08.360000::with my eyeballs, three books, and I listened to 10 books.
0:57:08.360000 - 0:57:10::You got to disclaimer say that.
0:57:10 - 0:57:11::Yeah.
0:57:11 - 0:57:11.840000::So that's OK.
0:57:11.840000 - 0:57:14.400000::Yeah, you can't even mention the audio book at all.
0:57:14.400000 - 0:57:16.280000::It's not, it's a separate thing.
0:57:16.280000 - 0:57:18.840000::May I say I just listened to my first ever audio book.
0:57:18.840000 - 0:57:20.240000::It took about two and a half hours.
0:57:20.240000 - 0:57:22.320000::David Lynch finding the big fish, whatever's called catching it.
0:57:22.320000 - 0:57:23.960000::Oh, that's a great one.
0:57:23.960000 - 0:57:26.760000::And may I say I'd never listen to an audio book before.
0:57:26.760000 - 0:57:30.600000::And after listening to it, that is not reading.
0:57:30.600000 - 0:57:31.080000::I'm sorry.
0:57:31.080000 - 0:57:31.600000::That's my final.
0:57:31.600000 - 0:57:32.120000::Did he do it?
0:57:32.120000 - 0:57:34.360000::Did David Lynch do the audio?
0:57:34.360000 - 0:57:36.360000::He has a buttery smooth.
0:57:36.360000 - 0:57:37.840000::It's a list of rough.
0:57:37.840000 - 0:57:38.680000::He's enjoyable.
0:57:38.680000 - 0:57:40.720000::Let me get a nice, what gave you joy, dude?
0:57:40.720000 - 0:57:42.680000::Let me give Eric a little drop here.
0:57:42.680000 - 0:57:43.200000::Oh, please.
0:57:43.200000 - 0:57:44.680000::I've got to find a good one here.
0:57:44.680000 - 0:57:45.680000::Please.
0:57:45.680000 - 0:57:49.560000::Oh, that's what I do.
0:57:49.560000 - 0:57:52::The goat, the presidential goat.
0:57:52 - 0:57:54.480000::You know, I'll be fine.
0:57:54.480000 - 0:57:56.480000::OK, well, damn.
0:57:56.480000 - 0:58:00.360000::So what gave me joy was you guys know I make a lot of salads.
0:58:00.360000 - 0:58:03.320000::And when I'm making my salads, I'm just
0:58:03.320000 - 0:58:07.360000::putting mainly vegetables in there or protein.
0:58:07.360000 - 0:58:08.240000::Classic.
0:58:08.240000 - 0:58:10.480000::And sometimes I feel like, man, I'm running out
0:58:10.480000 - 0:58:13.400000::of vegetables that I like in my salad.
0:58:13.400000 - 0:58:17.640000::And I just want to mix up with different dressings.
0:58:17.640000 - 0:58:21.400000::And I've been putting fruit in the salad
0:58:21.400000 - 0:58:24.240000::with balsamic vinegar.
0:58:24.240000 - 0:58:25.840000::And I'm telling you, this has just
0:58:25.840000 - 0:58:29.760000::opened up a whole new chapter of the salad world.
0:58:29.760000 - 0:58:32.160000::You put some strawberries in there, some apples,
0:58:32.160000 - 0:58:36.600000::some blueberries, mix with the balsamic vinegar.
0:58:36.600000 - 0:58:41::This is like a mom in 1996 changing your life after some
0:58:41 - 0:58:45::postpartum depression.
0:58:45 - 0:58:46.440000::That's the joy.
0:58:46.440000 - 0:58:47.840000::I think, congratulations, though, man.
0:58:47.840000 - 0:58:49.280000::Thank you, man.
0:58:49.280000 - 0:58:49.800000::Thank you.
0:58:49.800000 - 0:58:52.560000::I'll see.
0:58:52.560000 - 0:58:53.400000::We got to drop.
0:58:53.400000 - 0:58:55.360000::Yeah, now you're getting it.
0:58:55.360000 - 0:58:58::Oh, it's a hill.
0:58:58 - 0:58:59.880000::Mistah Hill.
0:58:59.880000 - 0:59:01.520000::I'm not a big salad guy.
0:59:01.520000 - 0:59:03.400000::And if I do, I usually never get dressing
0:59:03.400000 - 0:59:05.240000::and find it a little weird.
0:59:05.240000 - 0:59:08.880000::But a vinegarette is kind of where I would go if I was going to do.
0:59:08.880000 - 0:59:09.880000::Wow.
0:59:09.880000 - 0:59:10.680000::Yeah.
0:59:10.680000 - 0:59:11.720000::Cleans back.
0:59:11.720000 - 0:59:13.720000::Yeah, that's where my joy has some time to think when you guys
0:59:13.720000 - 0:59:14.880000::were talking.
0:59:14.880000 - 0:59:15.880000::Yeah.
0:59:15.880000 - 0:59:18.440000::Like you said, there's been a lot of joy in my life.
0:59:18.440000 - 0:59:22.360000::So instead of picking one of those, I'm going to kind of try to pass it.
0:59:22.360000 - 0:59:26.840000::I got some joy from a friend when I was in London, actually, who
0:59:26.840000 - 0:59:29.480000::revealed to me that she's pregnant with a baby.
0:59:29.480000 - 0:59:30.720000::Oh.
0:59:30.720000 - 0:59:32.440000::She told me the name of the baby, too.
0:59:32.440000 - 0:59:34.320000::And it's a name.
0:59:34.320000 - 0:59:36.200000::That name, you really giving a lot of joy.
0:59:36.200000 - 0:59:36.720000::You hear that name?
0:59:36.720000 - 0:59:37.800000::That.
0:59:37.800000 - 0:59:40.600000::That why does that name get bringing you so much joy?
0:59:40.600000 - 0:59:41.120000::I don't know.
0:59:41.120000 - 0:59:44.080000::Something about it just kind of a little tiny, like,
0:59:44.080000 - 0:59:45.080000::a little bit.
0:59:45.080000 - 0:59:47.440000::But my lips just peaked up a little bit and she saw my reaction.
0:59:47.440000 - 0:59:49.440000::Oh, well, like the name.
0:59:49.440000 - 0:59:50.920000::I was like, how do I do?
0:59:50.920000 - 0:59:52.920000::There's nothing like new life.
0:59:52.920000 - 0:59:53.920000::Nothing like that.
