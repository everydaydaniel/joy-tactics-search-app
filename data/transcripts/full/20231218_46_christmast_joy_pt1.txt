0:00:00 - 0:00:03::So what have you died? And when you went to heaven,
0:00:04 - 0:00:09::it was, heaven is just a highlight reel all your top 10 plays in video games, you know what I'm saying?
0:00:10 - 0:00:12::I'll be so disappointed if that one.
0:00:13 - 0:00:15::What? This is what happened?
0:00:16 - 0:00:17::I fucking kidding me.
0:00:30 - 0:00:32::I'm a singer. Enjoy.
0:01:00 - 0:01:02::Oh,
0:01:04 - 0:01:06::Is it just like
0:01:07 - 0:01:09::What's that name?
0:01:10 - 0:01:12::I forgot. I mean, I put my own
0:01:13 - 0:01:17::This like guys asking him a new fucking belt knit from the Alzheimer's War.
0:01:19 - 0:01:24::Oh my god. All simmers. Can you guys please put out a fucking the Alzheimer's mix tape in just
0:01:24 - 0:01:26::a studio every day?
0:01:26 - 0:01:30::And I just have and I feel like dude, I would make magic.
0:01:30 - 0:01:33::I couldn't agree with that. You have no intuition or whatever. No inhibition.
0:01:35 - 0:01:41::Do you know when I was on the cruise ship and they did this big Christmas show and all of the singers and dancers from the musical?
0:01:42 - 0:01:49::Got to put on kind of their own spin on things and this is when baby is called outside as being condemned to high hell like people hated this song.
0:01:50 - 0:01:55::Oh, because of the sexual they're trying to cancel right they're trying to cancel baby as I was cold outside.
0:01:56 - 0:02:02::And they did a gender swap and they made it to where the woman was poisoning the man. Oh no.
0:02:03 - 0:02:06::They push she poisoned him. Now I'm just trying to kill him.
0:02:07 - 0:02:12::Now is that the answer is that the on a fucking cruise ship? Is that really the answer? No. Don't make it.
0:02:12 - 0:02:19::You're doubting so heavily the power of theater and what it can do to people.
0:02:20 - 0:02:25::I have not I've never doubted if you think I've ever doubted the power of theater you must know the wrong one.
0:02:26 - 0:02:28::You might not know the right one.
0:02:29 - 0:02:31::Yeah, they should change the world.
0:02:32 - 0:02:36::Yeah, it definitely can change my world. Turn me into a superstar.
0:02:36 - 0:02:43::It can also you know, it's not literally make a different world. Not just change it, but not just rearrange it, but I guess change it is.
0:02:44 - 0:02:48::I don't know if you know what I'm trying to say it's a whole different thing. It's not changed. It's a different thing.
0:02:49 - 0:02:53::So this is it's Christmas week. We are Christmas.
0:02:53 - 0:02:57::We are the best weeks ever created and this is our first Christmas episode.
0:02:58 - 0:03:02::Really kind of and Nate's on about 22 hours of fasting right now.
0:03:02 - 0:03:04::Nate, how do you feel?
0:03:04 - 0:03:07::22 hours of fasting right now.
0:03:08 - 0:03:12::And you know what feeling pretty normal.
0:03:12 - 0:03:20::I've done the I've done three full days this year earlier this year. I did 72 hours of fasting.
0:03:21 - 0:03:31::And if you're thinking about doing it, I would say go ahead and fucking do it because you feel it just kind of cleanses anything that's going on in your body.
0:03:31 - 0:03:43::Your brain and Lord knows I think I need some sort of cleansing some sort of you know, some sort of remedy to what's going on in my brain, my body, whatever.
0:03:43 - 0:03:45::So I'm trying to I'm trying to.
0:03:45 - 0:03:46::What is going on?
0:03:46 - 0:03:47::What is going on?
0:03:47 - 0:03:56::Why do you feel like your brain needs to be cleaned? What is going on? Are you thinking about porn or pornographic sinful sin sinful sinful thoughts?
0:03:56 - 0:03:58::Oh, whoa.
0:03:59 - 0:04:08::No, I've I've been well, you guys can tell from my language challenges been the past couple episodes that there's something something crazy going on.
0:04:08 - 0:04:13::I feel like I've been having some kind of brain fog from I have to right.
0:04:13 - 0:04:20::Some sort of illness I had in the past month, like some post. I don't know if it's a long COVID or something like that.
0:04:20 - 0:04:26::I'm just trying to do trying out some different things to see if I can fix fix that.
0:04:26 - 0:04:28::Flip it in reverse it.
0:04:28 - 0:04:29::Yeah.
0:04:29 - 0:04:32::Well, that's going to work for you at work last time. It'll work again.
0:04:32 - 0:04:36::Isn't that weird? How sometimes the remedy is no remedy?
0:04:36 - 0:04:37::You know what I'm saying?
0:04:37 - 0:04:38::Right.
0:04:38 - 0:04:47::How the fuck is that? That's so funny because you always think about like, you know, what if the aliens come to earth and we're all trying to figure out a kill them and we can't figure it out and then it's pee.
0:04:47 - 0:04:49::You know what I'm saying?
0:04:49 - 0:04:51::I mean, pee is the thing that kills them.
0:04:51 - 0:04:58::I just mean like, when I say that, yeah, but what I mean is like, oh, I wonder what the antidote's going to be.
0:04:58 - 0:05:00::It's going to be some random ass thing.

0:05:00 - 0:05:06.280000::it's nothing. The thing is like maybe I think there is at least one sort of big
0:05:06.280000 - 0:05:13.720000::solution whether it's like a cure for a disease or whatever just so something
0:05:13.720000 - 0:05:19.600000::that could go into a medicine that is really strange and a scientist would
0:05:19.600000 - 0:05:24.240000::never even begin to think that. Yeah, right. And that's why we might be the best
0:05:24.240000 - 0:05:28.240000::type of scientists because we think outside the box. We're not even even in their
0:05:28.240000 - 0:05:31.720000::box. And yet we get no funding and yet we get no funding year after year. Right.
0:05:31.720000 - 0:05:38.320000::Even though I'm from the journal. Can we start the joy tactics lab? Oh, check it out.
0:05:38.320000 - 0:05:42.800000::Yeah, we should. Here's the here's the first beaker beaker number one joy
0:05:42.800000 - 0:05:49.120000::mug. You know what I read mostly lately? J store? You guys are reading all
0:05:49.120000 - 0:05:53.360000::types of different culture books. I'm reading J store up until the
0:05:53.360000 - 0:05:57.520000::what is that? It's classic candlelight. It's a classic magazine. What is J store?
0:05:57.520000 - 0:06:03.680000::Yeah. J stores. Who's reading J store for fun? Get out of here. I don't like
0:06:03.680000 - 0:06:08.200000::people that smart get out of my house. What's J store, man? Please J stores that
0:06:08.200000 - 0:06:14.880000::call it's a it's a exclusive online repository of scholarly articles.
0:06:14.880000 - 0:06:20.200000::The positive part in the past word. And there's no why are they gatekeeping
0:06:20.200000 - 0:06:23::knowledge in this day and age? This is the last thing they should be doing.
0:06:23 - 0:06:27.160000::The and you can't gatekeep knowledge by the way because knowledge is the one
0:06:27.160000 - 0:06:30.600000::thing you can't possess or whatever. That's right. I mean you can't
0:06:30.600000 - 0:06:35.960000::obviously possess it but you can't singularly gate. I don't know. Whatever.
0:06:35.960000 - 0:06:40.840000::So knowledge is like water and J store is like Nestle. You know I'm saying
0:06:40.840000 - 0:06:46.120000::if I can make that metaphor. You like so good at metaphor. How do you do it?
0:06:46.120000 - 0:06:52.280000::How do you do that? Erick. It's so crazy. Yeah. Erick. Do you like you who?
0:06:52.280000 - 0:06:58.600000::You who? No. What? Oh, I thought you were setting it up for an amazing joke.
0:06:58.600000 - 0:07:05.480000::Yeah, I do like you who? Me too. I really like it. It really feels like there's a
0:07:05.480000 - 0:07:10.040000::about a D's nuts. Yeah. Yeah. I know. Come to you know what you play around
0:07:10.040000 - 0:07:13::enough with words like that. People will become suspicious of you and that's
0:07:13 - 0:07:17.960000::what I am of you right now. I'm not crowing wolf. I'm laughing wolf.
0:07:20.760000 - 0:07:23.720000::Do you know what I'm trying to say? So Christmas time is here.
0:07:24.440000 - 0:07:29::Right. And that means different Jack. I know you are Jewish. No. So you
0:07:32.840000 - 0:07:37.800000::well, I did. But but we did celebrate Christmas not in the religious way but we got
0:07:38.600000 - 0:07:46.920000::in the Santa Claus way. Correct. So Nate, were you going to Christmas
0:07:46.920000 - 0:07:51.720000::services heavily at church? Were you ever in the nativity scene at the church page?
0:07:51.720000 - 0:07:57.080000::Oh, damn dude. Yes, I was. I was in the fucking choir. I was learning sign language.
0:07:57.080000 - 0:08:03.320000::I knew silent. What the fuck? The sign language. I was in the some plays. I was in
0:08:03.320000 - 0:08:09.720000::the the the the the the what is that? What is that? The nativity scenes? Yeah. Yeah.
0:08:09.720000 - 0:08:16.280000::The nativity scene. So what describe a church service for those of us? Do you know the story
0:08:16.280000 - 0:08:22.440000::of Christmas, Jack? Or are you? Obviously, I know the story of Christmas. It's everybody
0:08:22.440000 - 0:08:28.200000::sends out wishes, puts out cookie and milk for mixed fashion. I know the brand is so funny.
0:08:28.200000 - 0:08:33.720000::That's the pagan. Right. Okay. Okay. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Let me try the religious one.
0:08:33.720000 - 0:08:38.280000::Let me start here. Satanic. Is that related at all? No, it's not. No. It's about Jesus.
0:08:38.280000 - 0:08:44.200000::It's about Jesus. Okay. So Jesus was born on Christmas. Correct. That's right. Because I can
0:08:44.200000 - 0:08:47.720000::think about the nativity scene when they're outside of the churches. There's a bunch of people
0:08:47.720000 - 0:08:54.520000::all gathered around a dude in a hood. So that's what that's what that's your story of Christmas.
0:08:54.520000 - 0:09:00.920000::So that's how you write the Bible. That's how I'm like your best I got. I probably could do
0:09:00.920000 - 0:09:05.240000::to run a me Leviticus. Yeah. Leviticus is all about killing a fucking lamb or something.
0:09:06.840000 - 0:09:11.320000::So that's like, I Leviticus was the book we'd always turn to when we wanted to be al-Nadi during
0:09:11.320000 - 0:09:16.600000::the lot of pastors. I can say they talk about fucking they talk about all type of nasty shit in there.
0:09:16.600000 - 0:09:22.120000::And the Vedic is are you kidding me? And Eric, you know, for my chaf Torah, right? For my Torah
0:09:22.200000 - 0:09:29.160000::portion. Yeah. I had to they give you basically a portion of Torah to read. And mine was Leviticus,
0:09:29.160000 - 0:09:36.760000::man. So you'll be in the money. And the boy and the boy becomes the man and reading Leviticus.
0:09:36.760000 - 0:09:42.920000::And one pubes sprouted out of the hole. Man, I don't even remember when mine started coming out.
0:09:45.080000 - 0:09:50.680000::You're a couple of coming out of your chin right now. It's like my mom. I was like my mom.
0:09:50.680000 - 0:09:54.200000::I was we were talking about something. She's like, I really liked how your beard looked in that
0:09:54.200000 - 0:09:58.440000::one video. And I was like, Oh, do you like it now? Yeah. And she's like, Well, I liked how it looked
0:09:58.440000 - 0:09:59.960000::in that video.

0:10:26.920000 - 0:10:28.920000::How do you still survive?
0:10:28.920000 - 0:10:29.920000::That has survived.
0:10:29.920000 - 0:10:30.920000::Like how long?
0:10:30.920000 - 0:10:33.160000::You were chewing on the end of it there.
0:10:33.160000 - 0:10:34.160000::It wasn't me.
0:10:34.160000 - 0:10:35.160000::I don't do that.
0:10:35.160000 - 0:10:36.480000::It wasn't me.

0:10:42.400000 - 0:10:46.200000::How could you not get energy out when you're watching archives, studying archive material?
0:10:46.200000 - 0:10:51.040000::Like, I just looked out at 10 that is all fucking narrowed at the end.

0:11:01.760000 - 0:11:02.760000::Sorry, sorry, sorry.
0:11:02.760000 - 0:11:05.400000::And it's probably the predominantly people with vision issues.
0:11:05.400000 - 0:11:06.400000::Yeah.
0:11:06.400000 - 0:11:07.400000::Right.

0:11:24.440000 - 0:11:25.440000::They didn't consummate the marriage.
0:11:25.440000 - 0:11:26.440000::I think they were.
0:11:26.440000 - 0:11:28.440000::I think they were husband and wife.
0:11:28.440000 - 0:11:30.040000::Oh, so but they wouldn't ask me.
0:11:30.040000 - 0:11:31.360000::Are you kidding me?

0:12:12.800000 - 0:12:13.800000::No, no, Gabriel.
0:12:13.800000 - 0:12:16.800000::Well, Gabriel, here's the thing about the arch angel.
0:12:16.800000 - 0:12:17.800000::Okay.
0:12:17.800000 - 0:12:18.800000::Right.
0:12:18.800000 - 0:12:19.800000::Exactly.
0:12:19.800000 - 0:12:23.640000::He could be if you play with him when the final battle comes and we battle Satan after
0:12:23.640000 - 0:12:25.920000::the rapture, 10,000 years after the rapture.
0:12:25.920000 - 0:12:27.720000::Yeah, you wouldn't want to fuck with Gabriel.
0:12:27.720000 - 0:12:28.720000::Okay.
0:12:28.720000 - 0:12:30.480000::So Gabriel's a hero essentially.
0:12:30.480000 - 0:12:32.440000::Also, you don't know this, Eric.
0:12:32.440000 - 0:12:33.880000::This is about to blow your mind, man.
0:12:33.880000 - 0:12:35.560000::Say, tell me now.
0:12:35.560000 - 0:12:38.800000::You know who was it used to be an arch angel?
0:12:38.800000 - 0:12:41.760000::I mean, say him.
0:12:41.760000 - 0:12:45.480000::Guess you want to know what happened to my ass when I was a child?
0:12:45.480000 - 0:12:49.160000::Tell me this doesn't make me some type of prophet or some type of religious figure.
0:12:49.160000 - 0:12:51.160000::I'm having nightmares at every night.
0:12:51.160000 - 0:12:52.720000::Different type of nightmares after I saw.
0:12:52.800000 - 0:12:55.080000::After I walked in on my parents watching six cents.
0:12:55.080000 - 0:12:56.080000::Okay.
0:12:56.080000 - 0:12:57.680000::Couldn't sleep for about a year.
0:12:57.680000 - 0:13:01.840000::Now, during these nightmares, one night, I'm, and I'm already afraid of God.
0:13:01.840000 - 0:13:02.920000::I know he can see everything.
0:13:02.920000 - 0:13:03.920000::It scares me to my core.
0:13:03.920000 - 0:13:04.920000::As you can see, baby.
0:13:04.920000 - 0:13:07.560000::And I'm so afraid of going to hell.
0:13:07.560000 - 0:13:10.720000::And one night I have a nightmare where I'm in hell.
0:13:10.720000 - 0:13:13.560000::I just know it, but it's not the hell that's shown in cartoons.
0:13:13.560000 - 0:13:15.520000::It's not fiery and hot.
0:13:15.520000 - 0:13:18::It's pitch black and ice cold.
0:13:18 - 0:13:21.480000::And yet I'll know as an eight-year-old that I'm in hell.
0:13:21.480000 - 0:13:22.960000::And there's dripping water.
0:13:22.960000 - 0:13:24.920000::And I see a figure come through.
0:13:24.920000 - 0:13:27.880000::I see a figure walk through a doorway.
0:13:27.880000 - 0:13:29.520000::And how can I see it?
0:13:29.520000 - 0:13:32.960000::And he has a hood on like Voldemort, but I wasn't reading Harry Potter yet.
0:13:32.960000 - 0:13:34.760000::I wasn't allowed.
0:13:34.760000 - 0:13:40.560000::The figure takes off his head and he's pure glowing white, pure glowing white like an angel.
0:13:40.560000 - 0:13:44.240000::And I knew in my heart I had seen Satan the Devil.
0:13:44.240000 - 0:13:45::Fucking hell.
0:13:45 - 0:13:46.520000::And yet I'd never been taught that.
0:13:46.520000 - 0:13:47.880000::And he was white.
0:13:47.880000 - 0:13:49.560000::And he was white.
0:13:49.560000 - 0:13:53.560000::So what does that tell you about my relationship to the Almighty?
0:13:53.560000 - 0:13:57.400000::You should never have known what religion is.
0:13:57.400000 - 0:13:59.480000::I feel like this is so much better.
0:13:59.480000 - 0:14:05.560000::I would be a fucking the best realtor in Seattle, Washington right now if I never
0:14:05.560000 - 0:14:06.560000::had just been.
0:14:06.560000 - 0:14:10.560000::I had a dream that the Holy Spirit was even growing along.
0:14:10.560000 - 0:14:15.760000::Holy Spirit, form to fist, smack smack the top of our minivan, rip the top off, filled
0:14:15.760000 - 0:14:18.880000::on my family and took me up into the sky and threw me down.
0:14:18.880000 - 0:14:20.880000::That is fun to sit on.
0:14:20.880000 - 0:14:21.880000::That's a sick dream.
0:14:21.880000 - 0:14:24::I would fucking pay money to have a dream like that.
0:14:24 - 0:14:25::That's awesome.
0:14:25 - 0:14:26::That's epic.
0:14:26 - 0:14:30.440000::There's only one more thing about Satan.
0:14:30.440000 - 0:14:31.440000::Yeah.
0:14:31.440000 - 0:14:37.640000::The prequel to Satan, you know, this is like the hobbit of the Lord of the Rings for
0:14:37.640000 - 0:14:38.880000::at least for.
0:14:38.880000 - 0:14:39.880000::Okay.
0:14:39.880000 - 0:14:45.560000::I don't know if this was like, you know how there's like, you're, I think we might have been
0:14:45.560000 - 0:14:52.400000::talking about this, but just locally, I feel like, you know, you're being taught things
0:14:52.400000 - 0:14:56.800000::from the religious texts by just people in your community.
0:14:56.800000 - 0:15:00.040000::They're not like in your Sunday school, like for the

0:15:00 - 0:15:05.120000::the kids. You know, these aren't like people that have gone through theology, school, or
0:15:05.120000 - 0:15:09.760000::gone through any sort of formal training to be a pastor. They haven't studied the Bible.
0:15:09.760000 - 0:15:13.080000::They're just people that have gone to church a lot and they've kind of formed their own
0:15:13.080000 - 0:15:17.160000::opinions on the text. And a lot of those teachers are re- are
0:15:17.160000 - 0:15:28.240000::recent converts. Okay. We're all.
0:15:28.240000 - 0:15:37.760000::But no, they're like, you know, go ahead. Oh, I was just saying the reborn Christians like that get
0:15:37.760000 - 0:15:43.800000::saved in their adulthood after a life of crime and drugs. Those are the ones you should be afraid of
0:15:43.800000 - 0:15:47.840000::because they're the most intense about religion. When you say afraid, what do you mean? Like,
0:15:47.840000 - 0:15:53.400000::they're going to attack me or try to try to keep you with all their might. Now, why should I fear that?
0:15:53.400000 - 0:15:57.320000::Because you might not be able to resist when you hear the wonders of heaven and the
0:15:57.320000 - 0:16:01.240000::world. I can't resist. I've always felt that I'm very spiritually vulnerable and I want someone
0:16:01.240000 - 0:16:05.480000::to take advantage of me and bring me in because I'm sick of it, man. I don't want to be aware. I don't
0:16:05.480000 - 0:16:11.240000::want to be thinking so much about just hope. Just how there's a hope, certain hopelessness that I,
0:16:11.720000 - 0:16:17.400000::like when I look at Stephen Colbert and he's missing an ear and his family, I shouldn't bring him. But
0:16:17.400000 - 0:16:26.840000::he, uh, he has a certain happiness that it's like, you have to believe in God and heaven to
0:16:26.840000 - 0:16:32.520000::even access those levels of like, yeah. Hello, how are you doing today, man? You know what I'm saying?
0:16:32.520000 - 0:16:36.200000::Like, yeah, I look like a, yeah, I'm clearly faking it even when I just tried to do that.
0:16:37.160000 - 0:16:42.600000::So I'm now Stephen Colbert interviews Keanu Reeves and he goes, Keanu, what do you think happens to
0:16:42.600000 - 0:16:48.520000::our loved ones after they pass away? Oh, Stephen. Keanu takes a second to think and he looks up at
0:16:48.520000 - 0:16:53.560000::this guy, you know, he had a tragedy where his fiancee was killed. Was that? Keanu did.
0:16:54.280000 - 0:16:59.400000::And Keanu, and they were just printing with his child. She is great. A horrible tragedy happened.
0:17:00.120000 - 0:17:09.080000::And what does Keanu say? Something very insightful. He says, I know that way, I think I'm going to get
0:17:09.080000 - 0:17:14.360000::wrong. Here, I have it. I have it. Say it, say it, say it. He was like, wait, what was the beginning?
0:17:16.440000 - 0:17:20.600000::He was like, he was like, he was like, what happened to the world? Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
0:17:21.560000 - 0:17:27.560000::he was like, Stephen Colbert suck my fucking dick. The fuck up.
0:17:29.560000 - 0:17:33.080000::Please don't disrespect people. I'm not.
0:17:34.520000 - 0:17:41.240000::Now Keanu doesn't, doesn't play like that. No, I don't. I fully don't. I know that we miss them
0:17:41.960000 - 0:17:47.480000::and we love them. One of the most like that. What, where does Keanu get all of his wisdom from?
0:17:47.960000 - 0:17:52.760000::He, he seems to be. Keanu is respected by probably from all the grips that work on his movies, all the kind
0:17:52.760000 - 0:17:58.920000::of the gaffers and grips. Oh, yeah. Because you know, he's given them fucking Harleys and Rolexes.
0:17:58.920000 - 0:18:04.200000::So they, in part, their blue color wisdom upon him. And he absorbs it well because he's an actor.
0:18:04.200000 - 0:18:10.040000::And so he can portray what he's heard. Oh, that's what's funny. This is what I want to say about Satan.
0:18:10.040000 - 0:18:16.360000::That, um, Satan was the archangel of music. Did you know that?
0:18:16.840000 - 0:18:20.440000::Really? No, I had not, didn't have a clue about that. What the fuck is an arch angel?
0:18:21.160000 - 0:18:28.600000::An arch angel is like kind of the C suite like of a company. Like there's like the CEO and then there's
0:18:28.600000 - 0:18:34.440000::like the, the like CFO, you know, it's like kind of the people that are on the board of heaven.
0:18:34.440000 - 0:18:37.320000::So an arch angel trying to translate it to like,
0:18:38.760000 - 0:18:41.880000::did I say, what? A C suite with the fuck is that?
0:18:42.440000 - 0:18:48.360000::They go jackal though. Corporate. He can only speak in fun.
0:18:48.360000 - 0:18:53.400000::No, put in terms of like a stock market. Yeah, like if this is like a stock broker.
0:18:55.080000 - 0:18:59.880000::Now, so what's the, so an angel is just some bitch has a little baby flying around all fat and
0:18:59.880000 - 0:19:04.360000::weird with 600 eyes. And then an arch angel, that's somebody who works up at angel level.
0:19:04.360000 - 0:19:09.240000::Industries. Right. The arch angel has some, has some spirit, has some fiber. I don't think they were.
0:19:09.240000 - 0:19:13.160000::They got their clothes in that way. It's kind of classes. Like I don't think they start out.
0:19:13.160000 - 0:19:20.920000::Do you think so? It's a cast system. I don't think they work their way up. I think they live forever.
0:19:21.480000 - 0:19:29.800000::So remember that movie Michael Jackson with, um, with John Travolta and he plays angel angel never Michael.
0:19:30.520000 - 0:19:35.080000::No. Well, I haven't seen it, but I know. That's our home. That's our home.
0:19:35.080000 - 0:19:40.200000::This week, everybody go watch Michael. Watch it with your family. I'm never gonna laugh on this podcast again.
0:19:42.760000 - 0:19:44.920000::So wait, let's finish out the story of Christmas.
0:19:46.280000 - 0:19:49.480000::They're all pregnant, right? And they, why do they have to leave their home?
0:19:49.480000 - 0:19:54.600000::They why do they, why do they have to go on a little journey on a camel or a donkey? I mean,
0:19:55.240000 - 0:19:57.320000::you, you just skip the whole wise man thing.
0:19:58.280000 - 0:19:59.960000::This is so fucking good.

0:20:00 - 0:20:05.920000::music man. Can I even try and recap this? So there's a virgin. She's pregnant. Some dude Gabriel comes
0:20:05.920000 - 0:20:10.960000::up and tries to slide. Is that the what's happening? No, no, no, no, he's not. He wasn't trying to hit.
0:20:11.680000 - 0:20:17.920000::He's like boom. It's in you. You and now have Jesus in your ass.
0:20:18.800000 - 0:20:22.960000::And you need to release him into the world. So Gabriel's just letting her know like
0:20:23.920000 - 0:20:28.400000::he's the message. By the way, don't be shocked. Okay, we're yeah. He's our
0:20:28.400000 - 0:20:35.360000::angel. But then they have to get to what are they going Bethlehem? Beautiful Bethlehem.
0:20:35.360000 - 0:20:40.240000::Something where I've always wanted to go. They get to go there for Christmas. And they're trying
0:20:40.240000 - 0:20:44.720000::to find a damn hotel, right? And they started a network. The king of all men, the king of
0:20:44.720000 - 0:20:49.040000::son of God. They can't find a hotel. They can't get anywhere. So they have to go to a bloody
0:20:49.040000 - 0:20:54.720000::barn, right? There's no room at the end. So guess where Jesus gets born? Not in a princely bed,
0:20:54.720000 - 0:21:00.160000::like a king would be a man in the palace. Like a king would be in a damn manger, Jack.
0:21:00.160000 - 0:21:07.280000::I hate in the hay next to cows. What's a manger? What's a manger? Oh, what's a manger?
0:21:07.280000 - 0:21:12.240000::It's a room with hay in it. Got it. Hey, man. So what you're telling me this story?
0:21:12.240000 - 0:21:16.080000::And then all the three, and you want to know where the three three wise men got the tip that Jesus
0:21:16.080000 - 0:21:21.920000::is being born, the new king, they come from all over Africa, all the rest of the places.
0:21:21.920000 - 0:21:25.760000::But they only three of them. They're just like, it's a mirror, gold. And they show up to the damn
0:21:25.760000 - 0:21:31.920000::manger with all these princes come to them. We got to slow down, Jack. This is too much information.
0:21:31.920000 - 0:21:37.280000::Yeah. How do they process this? Okay. Where do you confuse that? What do you understand?
0:21:37.280000 - 0:21:44.960000::I see holes all over this plot. How do they get the three wise men? Who the fuck is that?
0:21:44.960000 - 0:21:48.640000::Where do they come from? How do they fit into the story? And if they come from all over Africa,
0:21:48.720000 - 0:21:52.880000::how's that possible? If there's 55 countries in Africa, there's only three wise men that could maybe
0:21:52.880000 - 0:21:58.880000::come from three places in Africa, modern speaking. And why are they there? Why does anybody give a
0:21:58.880000 - 0:22:03.920000::fuck? This bitch's pregnant. Sorry to use the B word, but I'm colloquial. Because they somehow got
0:22:03.920000 - 0:22:08.720000::the tip too that this amazing God is being pulled up. This dude's pulling up. And why did they go
0:22:08.720000 - 0:22:15.200000::again? Why did they go from Nazareth to wherever? Well, and you know how they did this, Jack. This is
0:22:15.200000 - 0:22:20.560000::the answer to that. They were following a star in the sky. The beautiful star. But what was the
0:22:20.560000 - 0:22:26.800000::star really? Well, back in those times, they could only say they could say, oh, this is a star in
0:22:26.800000 - 0:22:33.280000::the sky. But what was that really now that we know? The sun, right? Now that we know about these
0:22:33.280000 - 0:22:42.080000::crazy technologies in the universe, it might have been an alien spaceship. That's guiding.
0:22:42.080000 - 0:22:46.480000::Don't say too much because we're already writing this script about this shit. I play Jocuz.
0:22:48.720000 - 0:22:52.880000::Fucking Rachel make Adam's is playing. Oh, Mary.
0:22:54.320000 - 0:23:00::Nate, you played Jesus. You played Jesus for sure, Nate, but I'll grow up. We got fucking
0:23:00 - 0:23:04.240000::Zach. We can be the baby playing the young Jesus. We should wait for Timothy Schalmat to have his
0:23:04.240000 - 0:23:10.160000::kid. And then that'll be Jesus in the baby version in Da Manja. Yeah. And then Jack, you play all the
0:23:10.640000 - 0:23:15.040000::the disciples like the clump style. No, Jack, you play the damn Romans.
0:23:18.080000 - 0:23:23.120000::You probably play Ponsh's pilot to be honest with you. You tell me all of these people were still
0:23:23.120000 - 0:23:28.640000::talking about the one Jesus story of Christmas. Yeah. Ponsh's pilot. That sounds like something
0:23:28.640000 - 0:23:32.480000::that they couldn't have came up with back then. Like those words were around like Ponsh's like
0:23:32.480000 - 0:23:35.920000::a place. Once again, you disrespect our ancestors and their intelligence by saying they couldn't
0:23:36 - 0:23:40.400000::come up with a name like that. Can I just share this real quick? We're just one second.
0:23:43.680000 - 0:23:52.880000::400,000 years ago, it was discovered in archaeological discovery in 2023 that there was a wooden house
0:23:53.920000 - 0:24:00::discovered. And when did we think that previously a wooden structure could have been
0:24:00.640000 - 0:24:06.320000::maybe 10,000 years ago, the early 11,000 years ago, we thought that was the farthest back
0:24:06.800000 - 0:24:12.160000::that we did say pre-naturelopithecus. That's not possible. You're telling me it was from
0:24:12.160000 - 0:24:18.880000::a low lineage that's not, well, it's from a lower hominid that isn't even human.
0:24:19.440000 - 0:24:26.640000::It was talking about a below Neanderthal below. Can I say this though? Because we look at these other
0:24:26.640000 - 0:24:30.720000::hominids and think idiot dumbass couldn't figure out how to fucking kill our
0:24:30.720000 - 0:24:35.360000::own. Could make it in New York. Couldn't do fucking just. Well, guess what? Guess who usually gets
0:24:35.360000 - 0:24:40.720000::all beat up? It's the nerds. The fucking nerds are the ones that always get killed first.
0:24:40.720000 - 0:24:48.640000::So I'll bet you're saying the homo sapiens or whoever are direct ancestors were killed.
0:24:48.640000 - 0:24:55.280000::Now, Brainiac, other hominids, all short. Now hold on a second. What do you think about that?
0:24:55.280000 - 0:24:59.680000::I think maybe, I guess if all the technology they had was wood, then maybe.

0:25:00 - 0:25:06.560000::But now if some shit hit the fan, you know all the nerds are gonna be up in the fucking gas chamber while the asteroid
0:25:06.800000 - 0:25:11.120000::Cloud plume poisons all the jocks who are out there trying to fucking shoot everybody. You know what I'm saying
0:25:11.680000 - 0:25:13.920000::So who's to say depends on at what point?
0:25:15.360000 - 0:25:20.720000::In human technology where if we've shifted the power dynamic because these days if someone's big and strong
0:25:22.960000 - 0:25:28.720000::We have so many tech pieces of technology that nullified right look at fucking like you could get murked by fucking
0:25:30.080000 - 0:25:31.600000::Who's that dude in the wheelchair the scientist
0:25:32.400000 - 0:25:34.400000::Professor X
0:25:34.400000 - 0:25:36.320000::Do you have to do it? Professor X
0:25:37.360000 - 0:25:38.880000::Professor X
0:25:38.880000 - 0:25:39.560000::From X-Mov
0:25:39.560000 - 0:25:41.120000::Patrick's do it
0:25:42.240000 - 0:25:44.240000::So hold on a second
0:25:44.480000 - 0:25:46.480000::So then Christmas day became
0:25:47.040000 - 0:25:52.640000::So a thing she was pregnant and she went to give birth in this other place
0:25:53.520000 - 0:25:57.120000::seemingly because she liked it there or some shit maybe was by the church
0:25:57.120000 - 0:26:02.400000::To follow the star oh because there was a fucking star so she was following an alien and suddenly
0:26:03.040000 - 0:26:07.040000::She was like yeah, I got stop following this shit because I was having a baby
0:26:07.760000 - 0:26:09.760000::Um, they had to get to Bethlehem
0:26:10 - 0:26:15.120000::Because why because that's why what what what what what I mean. This is where you go the bible's not literal is it
0:26:16.800000 - 0:26:21.520000::Hey carefully notice how I ask questions. Yeah notice how curious I am
0:26:22.400000 - 0:26:26.800000::Right notice that I notice I love and that's why and we love that about you
0:26:27.280000 - 0:26:30.640000::Well, I'm just here to make sure that everybody's thinking critically about their beliefs
0:26:31.520000 - 0:26:33.040000::so
0:26:33.040000 - 0:26:37.280000::And you know what I look at an activity. I'm not Christian anymore for now
0:26:37.600000 - 0:26:41.040000::It could change pretty quickly with a couple of more road bumps in the road for me
0:26:42.160000 - 0:26:44.160000::Yeah, I'll come crawling back
0:26:44.400000 - 0:26:49.840000::But I still see the nativity scene as an essential part of Christmas day core. What do you guys think about that?
0:26:50.080000 - 0:26:54.800000::Let me get one of my just a little ass and it to be beautiful nativity scene is this one
0:26:55.520000 - 0:27:01.280000::I'm pointing at the joy tactics. Oh, that the joy tactics mug. No, that's not an activity. You see
0:27:02.800000 - 0:27:04.800000::What makes it one it's not even an adaptation
0:27:05.680000 - 0:27:09.120000::Netsivity scene man you need a fucking barn you need a
0:27:10.240000 - 0:27:15.440000::Childhood looks son of God Jesus baby Jesus. You need the wise men
0:27:16.240000 - 0:27:19.280000::We might be the damn wise men. Why didn't we think about that three
0:27:20.400000 - 0:27:24.560000::Uh straight man. Oh my goodness. Can we get funding to have the three
0:27:24.800000 - 0:27:31.920000::Wise men the journey. It's a us just chilling in the desert. This will be so cheap to make all we need is a camel three camels
0:27:32.720000 - 0:27:37.520000::It's like Harold and Kumar go to White Castle, but it's Eric Jack and they play wise men that go get Jesus fine Jesus
0:27:38 - 0:27:42.480000::Oh, yeah, but we're too fucking smoking on the time in the herb and the murder or whatever and you know
0:27:42.480000 - 0:27:49.520000::They had probably just only hash back then that's the ancient type of weed is hash so we were probably all I was having a panic attack pulling up on Jesus
0:27:50.480000 - 0:27:53.520000::Nate you were fucking nodding out jack
0:27:54.320000 - 0:27:56.320000::Get your playing fucking
0:27:57.200000 - 0:27:59.200000::Play where's gate? Oh
0:27:59.280000 - 0:28:08.240000::Huh? Wait, what? Playing Marley. Does that mean I have Marley? Oh, I thought you meant I'm playing the dog from Marley
0:28:11.920000 - 0:28:17.120000::So okay, we hit the you religious part of Christmas as we had to we had to acknowledge the origin
0:28:17.760000 - 0:28:23.600000::Chris that type of Christmas even though we're so stretched everybody's important to stretch get it out now
0:28:23.600000 - 0:28:26.960000::We're gonna get hit the fun stuff presents santi-clothes
0:28:28 - 0:28:30::Candy canes
0:28:31.120000 - 0:28:37.440000::Oh, Agna let me get a sip of that. I don't know that I've ever tried that stuff, but I bet it's fucking tasty, isn't it?
0:28:38.240000 - 0:28:40.560000::They say it's gross. We're trying to agnog Jack
0:28:41.680000 - 0:28:43.680000::No, we just do bloody marries and shit
0:28:44.640000 - 0:28:46.640000::His agnog
0:28:46.640000 - 0:28:47.760000::Good
0:28:47.760000 - 0:28:52.080000::Yeah, agnog is too good, but I couldn't believe how good it was when I was a child scared me
0:28:52.720000 - 0:28:54.560000::I would say that agnog is a little bit
0:28:55.200000 - 0:29:00.720000::It's like it's good because it's like 20% bad. You know what I'm saying?
0:29:01.520000 - 0:29:03.760000::There's kind of like a taste to it where you're like this
0:29:04.800000 - 0:29:10.880000::This it's kind of like I would say like alcohol like if you right if alcohol didn't get you drunk would you drink a beer?
0:29:11.040000 - 0:29:14.880000::You need to be like maybe but it kind of tastes bad in a way
0:29:15.600000 - 0:29:18.640000::You need it just in a little ass glass, you know, I mean take a
0:29:19.280000 - 0:29:20.960000::sip of that
0:29:20.960000 - 0:29:22.960000::Slug a whiskey
0:29:24.240000 - 0:29:26.480000::I mean that's yeah, it is yeah
0:29:27.680000 - 0:29:32.800000::No, you know that's one of our that's one of the real-life Harry Potter style drinks, you know, I'm saying agnog
0:29:33.760000 - 0:29:35.760000::So like
0:29:35.760000 - 0:29:40.320000::So agnog is milk whipping cream sugar and egg yolks
0:29:41.120000 - 0:29:43.760000::Yep, and probably something else and probably something else
0:29:45.200000 - 0:29:48::A nutmeg you could put in there brandy in fact
0:29:48.800000 - 0:29:53.440000::You're gonna have a vanilla extract and climb walk on the treadmill after a glass of that. I'll just say that
0:29:53.760000 - 0:29:56.320000::That's curious that's why I'm curious
0:29:57.440000 - 0:29:59.200000::so
0:29:59.200000 - 0:30:01.200000::Well

0:30:00 - 0:30:06::Let's discuss now because we've all kind of had falls from grace.
0:30:06 - 0:30:15::And though it's not about Jesus anymore, it still brings us all together
0:30:15 - 0:30:17::and that is interesting, right?
0:30:17 - 0:30:20::It's like, of course.
0:30:20 - 0:30:21::What is it?
0:30:21 - 0:30:26::Do we need to let go of it to fully let go of the trauma from being raised Christian?
0:30:26 - 0:30:30::Or do we need to just say, you know what?
0:30:30 - 0:30:34::Something really bad happened here, but also some good stuff happened.
0:30:34 - 0:30:37::And we don't, you know what I'm trying to say or what's happening.
0:30:37 - 0:30:38::What's going on right now?
0:30:38 - 0:30:41::I'm trying to wrap my head around these sentences.
0:30:41 - 0:30:45::I think we need to fold in.
0:30:45 - 0:30:50::I think this is a time period where we need to, as Americans,
0:30:50 - 0:30:55::just fully embrace and own the fact that this is just the capitalism
0:30:55 - 0:30:58::of Christmas, you know?
0:30:58 - 0:30:59::Yeah.
0:30:59 - 0:31:00::Just own it.
0:31:00 - 0:31:05::Just for one second, put down the anarchy, put down the socialism.
0:31:05 - 0:31:07::Let's just go to the damn mall.
0:31:07 - 0:31:12::Go to the five-way, buy some shit, support the economy.
0:31:12 - 0:31:14::This is the capitalist month.
0:31:14 - 0:31:17::It really is just a capitalist holiday.
0:31:17 - 0:31:18::Yeah, it is.
0:31:18 - 0:31:20::Well, hold on a fucking second.
0:31:20 - 0:31:23::I kind of want to try and reframe this idea because
0:31:23 - 0:31:26::it's a lot of capitalism and capitalism.
0:31:26 - 0:31:28::Is commerce inherently capitalist?
0:31:28 - 0:31:29::Do you know what I'm saying?
0:31:29 - 0:31:32::Doesn't mean that your society has to be capitalism to just barter.
0:31:32 - 0:31:34::Hey, man, let me, you know what I'm saying?
0:31:34 - 0:31:40::If it was like, let me give you exactly one goat's worth of fucking soda
0:31:40 - 0:31:43::for that soda for to give to my family.
0:31:43 - 0:31:49::Do we have to be shackled by capitalism to enjoy the fruits of commerce
0:31:49 - 0:31:50::and gift giving?
0:31:50 - 0:31:55::I think there's a lot of propaganda being spilled against capitalism.
0:31:55 - 0:31:58::You know, if DSA had their way, we'd be trained potato trading potatoes
0:31:58 - 0:32:00::for iPhones, whatever.
0:32:00 - 0:32:01::By the way.
0:32:01 - 0:32:02::But we don't live in a world where we can do that.
0:32:02 - 0:32:03::I don't know how to grow a potato.
0:32:03 - 0:32:07::I don't know what type of thing, how they are grown.
0:32:07 - 0:32:08::And root.
0:32:08 - 0:32:09::You know what I'm saying?
0:32:09 - 0:32:11::So just let us have it.
0:32:11 - 0:32:14::Let us enjoy, let us live in the decay and enjoy.
0:32:14 - 0:32:16::Is a potato a seed fully?
0:32:16 - 0:32:18::A potato is a root.
0:32:18 - 0:32:23::But if you put a potato in the ground, will a another potato grow off?
0:32:23 - 0:32:28::That's a question that we should answer on our new science fucking YouTube channel.
0:32:28 - 0:32:31::What do you need a potato seed?
0:32:31 - 0:32:36::Science for fucking 2.8 below GPA adults.
0:32:36 - 0:32:38::Yeah.
0:32:38 - 0:32:41::People are screaming outside.
0:32:41 - 0:32:42::It's Christmas time.
0:32:42 - 0:32:44::That's why they're so stoked.
0:32:44 - 0:32:47::Can you imagine just getting a present and fucking screaming?
0:32:47 - 0:32:48::Yeah.
0:32:48 - 0:32:49::Like so excited.
0:32:49 - 0:32:51::Just so excited that you scream.
0:32:51 - 0:32:54::Remember that in 1064 video?
0:32:54 - 0:32:57::The kid gets the Nintendo 64.
0:32:57 - 0:33:00::I got an Nintendo 64 for Christmas.
0:33:00 - 0:33:01::You remember this?
0:33:01 - 0:33:02::And he screamed out.
0:33:02 - 0:33:03::What did he say?
0:33:03 - 0:33:04::Thank you.
0:33:04 - 0:33:09::He's like, he just goes, he just like, he just goes fucking nuts.
0:33:09 - 0:33:12::Like, what should you do that for you?
0:33:12 - 0:33:18::Like, for you would be a fucking new antibiotic that changes your life.
0:33:18 - 0:33:22::That cures the disease that you're not telling everybody about.
0:33:22 - 0:33:26::It would be some stem cells.
0:33:26 - 0:33:27::Rusted.
0:33:27 - 0:33:29::Wrap up some stem cells.
0:33:29 - 0:33:30::It's all good.
0:33:30 - 0:33:33::Yeah, just some loose stem cells that were stolen from the lab.
0:33:33 - 0:33:37::I wonder how small that would look.
0:33:37 - 0:33:39::A stem cell?
0:33:39 - 0:33:42::Because a regular cell even is probably bigger than a stem cell.
0:33:42 - 0:33:44::Yeah, I've seen a cell.
0:33:44 - 0:33:45::I've seen many cells.
0:33:45 - 0:33:47::I am looking at a couple right now.
0:33:47 - 0:33:48::Hmm.
0:33:48 - 0:33:50::I love, no, I'm not single.
0:33:50 - 0:33:53::So, what are we talking about again?
0:33:53 - 0:33:54::Christmas.
0:33:54 - 0:33:59::Oh yeah, what's the best Christmas present you guys ever got?
0:33:59 - 0:34:02::You know, it comes to mind when you say that.
0:34:02 - 0:34:03::What?
0:34:03 - 0:34:06::It is made up.
0:34:06 - 0:34:09::Oh, a couple things actually.
0:34:09 - 0:34:11::Okay.
0:34:11 - 0:34:12::Batmobile.

0:34:15 - 0:34:16::That's all.
0:34:16 - 0:34:21::Batman was Batman and Robin.
0:34:21 - 0:34:24::Remember that movie with the.
0:34:24 - 0:34:27::Forget who was the Batman during the Valkymer?
0:34:27 - 0:34:29::Yeah, yeah, yeah.

0:34:36 - 0:34:40::I was really into Batman as a.
0:34:40 - 0:34:46::Not super into it, but I was just like that was all I wanted was like a fucking Batman toy.
0:34:46 - 0:34:51::And in my parents were, you know, they didn't get me like good gifts.
0:34:51 - 0:34:52::Like really.
0:34:52 - 0:34:53::Yeah.
0:34:53 - 0:34:54::Hope my mom's all this into this.
0:34:54 - 0:34:55::It's going to be a fucking.
0:34:55 - 0:34:56::Oh man.
0:34:56 - 0:34:59::If Nate's coming, it's comedy fucking.
0:34:59 - 0:35:00::No, man.

0:36:05.740000 - 0:36:07.740000::Yeah, but it was fucking awesome
0:36:07.980000 - 0:36:10.980000::Man, you know Hasbro just laid off 1200 employees
0:36:12.420000 - 0:36:14.420000::Christmas time
0:36:14.820000 - 0:36:20.580000::Man those are the elves God. Those are the Christmas elves and they're putting them out on the streets and they're putting it down at home too
0:36:20.580000 - 0:36:23.960000::This is the society. Yeah, those ails probably do get it in
0:36:23.960000 - 0:36:28.960000::The other Christmas magic they probably get it in and all sorts of different directions too
0:36:29.600000 - 0:36:31.600000::What are elves doing all year being short?
0:36:32.600000 - 0:36:39.400000::All right, I don't know. Okay, they live in the box. What's your what was your best Christmas present? Let me think about it really hard
0:36:44.880000 - 0:36:48.280000::I mean it had to have been a skateboard
0:36:49.520000 - 0:36:51.520000::What was the brand I
0:36:51.520000 - 0:36:53.520000::would say the first ever
0:36:53.960000 - 0:36:55.480000::skateboard
0:36:55.480000 - 0:36:59::the Tony Hawk bird house deck oh
0:37:00.200000 - 0:37:05.760000::Shit blue. This is the iconic fucking graphic the blue one with the skeleton that goes like this
0:37:06.400000 - 0:37:13.400000::Yes, I know that Burdambard that is an iconic graphic and just looking at that shit makes me so fucking happy
0:37:14.040000 - 0:37:16.520000::Either that or probably a Pokemon Game Boy game. Oh
0:37:16.520000 - 0:37:18.520000::How
0:37:18.520000 - 0:37:21.080000::Like that Pokemon game boy that's what I figured out what
0:37:22 - 0:37:25.040000::Insomnia was and it didn't fuck with the back then
0:37:25.440000 - 0:37:31.440000::You could get no sleep as a kid and just be like that was perfect for me, you know, yeah, I needed that
0:37:31.440000 - 0:37:37.240000::I didn't need that every time I would sleep as a kid I wake up and go. I didn't need that shit. You know what I'm saying?
0:37:38.080000 - 0:37:43.040000::That was like the most immersed I'd ever been in it because I didn't even I was so stupid
0:37:43.040000 - 0:37:48.200000::I didn't I got my first Pokemon game first game boy game ever didn't have any consoles
0:37:48.200000 - 0:37:54.520000::But I got the indigo game boy color. Okay, remember this is a see through purple kind of oh, yeah
0:37:55.040000 - 0:37:58.760000::That was my first game boy first game I ever got was Pokemon red
0:37:59.240000 - 0:38:04.240000::And I couldn't figure out that you had to kept keep pressing the D pad to leave ashes house
0:38:04.240000 - 0:38:07.520000::And so the first day I played it. I was like how do I get out of this damn house?
0:38:07.760000 - 0:38:09.760000::And then I had to go to lunch next day and my
0:38:09.760000 - 0:38:12.760000::We're gonna keep keep pressing the button
0:38:15 - 0:38:20.320000::But you know we have any there weren't any guides. I wasn't going on. I'm sure there were guys, but I didn't have
0:38:20.320000 - 0:38:27.400000::They were books. They were books. Yeah, they've had Pokemon guides that were like little mini like
0:38:27.400000 - 0:38:32.200000::magazine self-conceived. I was a kid that would buy that like I would
0:38:32.680000 - 0:38:37.480000::Get the guide for a video game and I would follow it. Yeah
0:38:38.120000 - 0:38:41::Play by the book if I could
0:38:42.680000 - 0:38:48.680000::I when I played the when I played Fallout 3 my aunt got me the guidebook and at the same time
0:38:48.680000 - 0:38:52.060000::I was so immersed in this game and at the same time we had this rat and
0:38:52.060000 - 0:38:54.960000::Festation in the house and all these rats had died below the floorboards
0:38:54.960000 - 0:38:59.760000::And so as I'm playing the room smelled like rotting sort of rot and
0:39:00.400000 - 0:39:06.600000::Really put me in the game in a crazy way where I felt like that smell associated so hard to this rotting world
0:39:06.840000 - 0:39:12.320000::Isn't that crazy? Wow, that's beautiful. That's what you need to put that technology into gaming. Yeah for reals
0:39:12.320000 - 0:39:16.840000::Walking to the floor. I love a good smell like smoke my girlfriend got a new
0:39:17.340000 - 0:39:24.820000::Here I go put on glass my girlfriend got a new fragrance and it basically smells a body spray right it basically smells like
0:39:25.320000 - 0:39:30.520000::ax body spray, but in a good way. Oh shit takes me back to like
0:39:31.080000 - 0:39:33.080000::Is it like ax chocolate?
0:39:33.080000 - 0:39:35.080000::Remember that?
0:39:35.080000 - 0:39:38.240000::It smells like the blue one. I don't remember chocolate. That's food
0:39:38.960000 - 0:39:43.600000::But it reminds me of like when I wouldn't shower and I would just fucking spray like
0:39:44.080000 - 0:39:50.340000::The pits of an old shirt with this like you know, I'm saying like I put a dirty shirt on and just up in a wipe damn
0:39:50.340000 - 0:39:54.640000::Axe such a great who's using ax still is it just some of that I
0:39:55.440000 - 0:39:57.440000::Want some I want to eat X
0:39:58.480000 - 0:40:00.480000::Dude Eric

0:40:00 - 0:40:07.100000::I had a similar video game stuck experience when we first got the demo like the I think it must have been like
0:40:08.040000 - 0:40:14.040000::AOL sponsored Tony out prosecutor one demo. Yeah, and it came on like the lid of a fucking soda something
0:40:15 - 0:40:17.540000::and we plopped that into whatever the PlayStation and
0:40:18.880000 - 0:40:24.800000::In that first level you have to like smash through the glass to get into the hanger whatever it was
0:40:25.800000 - 0:40:30.100000::And we would just like go down, but there was a quarter pipe in the room and we would just like drop in
0:40:30.520000 - 0:40:36.620000::Try and turn as hard as we could back up the quarter pipe try and turn as hard as we could and then one day my friend accidentally broke through the glass
0:40:37.960000 - 0:40:42.240000::And it shock you we went whole my
0:40:43.040000 - 0:40:46.360000::Fucking God at that that honestly
0:40:47.240000 - 0:40:48.240000::Probably
0:40:48.240000 - 0:40:53.180000::Changed the course of my entire life if we had never accidentally found the rest of that level you wouldn't have been
0:40:54.180000 - 0:40:56.880000::I'd probably be at least six feet deep
0:40:57.500000 - 0:41:03.380000::Probably you think you would have it would have been game over for you in life probably I don't know I think
0:41:04.180000 - 0:41:06.880000::Yeah, I just think I would have been 15 years old and
0:41:09.140000 - 0:41:10.500000::Got shot
0:41:10.500000 - 0:41:14.740000::Okay, my top gaming moment of all time you guys are so curious. I'll tell you what it is
0:41:15.300000 - 0:41:21.660000::I'll put you at your top gaming moment top gaming moment all time. It's also to fill out three
0:41:23.180000 - 0:41:25.180000::and
0:41:25.180000 - 0:41:32.260000::This is I was playing at my friend David's house before we had the guide and we were and we were just stumbling around this
0:41:32.660000 - 0:41:37.220000::Damn wasteland not knowing what the hell's going on young enough to where the game still kind of scared me
0:41:37.220000 - 0:41:42.660000::You know what I mean? I was scared by the monsters and the fucking ghouls. That's good the radiation and
0:41:43.060000 - 0:41:49.900000::There's this one part you get one we walk into like a shed into a house and we're just exploring it and we click on a door
0:41:49.900000 - 0:41:53.860000::And it opens to a basement and in the basement is this huge level and
0:41:54.420000 - 0:41:56.460000::There's like you can get into a machine
0:41:56.460000 - 0:42:01.980000::Maybe you know, it's just abandoned basement you get into a machine and it puts you into like a virtual reality
0:42:01.980000 - 0:42:02.980000::What the fuck?
0:42:02.980000 - 0:42:07.020000::And the virtual reality was all black and white and it was like set in the 1950s and you can't escape
0:42:07.020000 - 0:42:12.620000::You're like in his madman's video game that he made to escape the reality of the nuclear wasteland
0:42:12.620000 - 0:42:18.060000::And we're walking around this black and white video game and it was I was just fucking cuz you're walking around
0:42:18.060000 - 0:42:22.860000::There's nothing going on here. What's in this house? It's a fucking whole another level where you put in a black and white
0:42:23.100000 - 0:42:27.900000::Fucking hell. Can you man? I mean that's no. Do they have that in games like this anymore?
0:42:27.900000 - 0:42:30.740000::I don't know. I don't know. Can you be that pure?
0:42:31.140000 - 0:42:34.140000::So what if you died and when you went to heaven?
0:42:34.980000 - 0:42:40.300000::It was heaven is just a highlight reel all your top 10 plays in video games, you know what I'm saying?
0:42:40.660000 - 0:42:42.660000::Yeah, that would be so disappointed
0:42:42.660000 - 0:42:46.660000::What would this is what happened?
0:42:46.660000 - 0:42:51.500000::I fucking kidding me. I take it. You know what I'm saying?
0:42:51.500000 - 0:43:01.700000::Honestly, if the afterlife is even like remotely benign, I will be relieved. It could suck. It could be like you are gonna be in your
0:43:02.020000 - 0:43:03.540000::relive your
0:43:03.540000 - 0:43:08.540000::Fucking elementary school cafeteria food every day for eternity. I'd be like all right. Well, you know what?
0:43:09.540000 - 0:43:17.380000::We're we're headed to psychedelic pain after we pass from this existence this plane. I just know it. Yeah, real
0:43:17.380000 - 0:43:24.100000::I just know it's not gonna be pleasant. Everybody that has the near death experience is say I felt peace that I want to go back to so bad.
0:43:24.340000 - 0:43:29.660000::Yeah, you might have felt it for a second right before you went into the fucking eternal torture chamber. You know what I'm saying?
0:43:29.660000 - 0:43:33.860000::Yeah, you're in the lobby. Yeah, that's right.
0:43:33.860000 - 0:43:40.660000::Can I share my top gaming moment? Please say it now and I think it might be best
0:43:41.620000 - 0:43:45.260000::said in the form of song actually. What the fuck?
0:43:45.260000 - 0:43:51.860000::I don't know if you guys all you guys all know this but this was my top gaming moment and I'll sing and I'll just sing a little song
0:44:03.860000 - 0:44:13.060000::My sanctuary my sanctuary. Yeah, it's
0:44:22.580000 - 0:44:31.660000::Never played that game. I don't even know that song. I just don't even know there's no pocket of the YouTube that I haven't been to so if you think I haven't seen a
0:44:31.660000 - 0:44:39.380000::Fucking metal cover of that song you out of your mind for no reason. This is the when you beat this kind of like the theme song of
0:44:39.380000 - 0:44:47.060000::Kingdom Hearts which is kind of a final fantasy slash Disney collaboration one of the first collaborations ever in the history of media
0:44:48.100000 - 0:44:52.580000::And I remember beating that game and you and I was brought to tears
0:44:53.380000 - 0:44:59.780000::Wow meeting this game. Yeah, that's awesome. I know and it was it was one of the most satisfying

0:45:00 - 0:45:07.440000::gaming experiences and final it has a really emotional kind of end to it and
0:45:07.440000 - 0:45:15.480000::the cut see because I would live for them cut the cut cover really and why
0:45:15.480000 - 0:45:20.880000::would they so and I would always be like why are they so the why is the the
0:45:20.880000 - 0:45:25.520000::rendering so much better than the actual game why can't the game be this good
0:45:25.520000 - 0:45:29.600000::yeah if I was in charge yeah like everything looked that good no doubt yeah it
0:45:29.600000 - 0:45:32.760000::doesn't have no no question that I mean the whole game that good that always
0:45:32.760000 - 0:45:40.400000::can be the sidebar but anyways I remember I got a demo for battlefront the
0:45:40.400000 - 0:45:44.560000::first starboard battlefront game with my both my buddy Nick and we just played
0:45:44.560000 - 0:45:48.080000::that there's an indoor level where you're just bad and we played it for 10
0:45:48.080000 - 0:45:51.920000::hours just the same level over and over that was the crack because I was such a
0:45:51.920000 - 0:45:56.600000::star wars fan that I could play a stormtrooper body now how are rebels are
0:45:56.600000 - 0:46:03::kidding me oh there's nothing like it yeah can you imagine that that's when a
0:46:03 - 0:46:07.680000::video game is good is when you're not playing to win you're playing to live
0:46:07.680000 - 0:46:12.560000::right when you're playing like when I'm playing skate three still pretty much
0:46:12.560000 - 0:46:16.600000::every day my life yeah and I'm skating like realistically I'm like oh what
0:46:16.600000 - 0:46:20.440000::would for the heads out there what would Eric cost to be skating like on this

0:46:42.720000 - 0:46:47.680000::know we're smart enough you can understand the story I couldn't give me some
0:46:47.680000 - 0:46:52.800000::give me a story beautiful I didn't look at it for one second I skipped every
0:46:52.800000 - 0:46:58.840000::single dialogue thing I couldn't name one character I just am fighting oriented
0:46:58.840000 - 0:47:05.240000::and I want to win so in the past men's young men's lives were shaped by labor by
0:47:05.240000 - 0:47:14.240000::war by famine religion by global conflict our lives are shaped so it seems by
0:47:14.240000 - 0:47:21.560000::moments in video games is that right the shape by the right we need to get it to get
0:47:21.560000 - 0:47:27.080000::there there's a masculinity crisis going on for a reason and that's because because
0:47:27.080000 - 0:47:33.440000::of our media die you know what I'm saying it's fluff if they would just have
0:47:33.440000 - 0:47:37.360000::little classes on masculinity moments of masculinity here I'm gonna hook
0:47:37.360000 - 0:47:42.920000::everybody up right now I'm gonna give you a lesson let's say there's a public

0:48:50.920000 - 0:48:54.600000::to but based on the global climate a lot of us are gonna be doing CPR in the
0:48:54.600000 - 0:48:59.400000::next 20 years you need to push so hard on their fucking chest that you break
0:48:59.400000 - 0:49:04.920000::their ribs that's the amount of no this is not this is not medical advice we

0:49:13.120000 - 0:49:17.360000::you disrespect in my knowledge you need to basically break their ribs to get
0:49:17.360000 - 0:49:21.480000::into their heart and get that shit restarting it's not easy but I'm imagining
0:49:21.480000 - 0:49:25.920000::somebody hearing this and then they push so hard they like go into their body
