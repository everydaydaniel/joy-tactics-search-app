0:05:34 - 0:05:36::B.A.C. is higher than the.
0:05:36 - 0:05:37::Year.

0:05:40 - 0:05:43::Confident intent content content.
0:05:43 - 0:05:44::And content.
0:05:44 - 0:05:46::Another's not eight.
0:05:46 - 0:05:47::Don't be.

0:05:49 - 0:05:51::I eat shave.
0:05:51 - 0:05:52::I eat you when you shave.
0:05:52 - 0:05:53::All right.
0:05:53 - 0:05:54::Oh, my.
0:05:54 - 0:05:55::Yo, hey, yo.
0:05:55 - 0:05:57::So this is, we're just giving out.
0:05:57 - 0:06:03::This is just like a free kind of beat for, you know, like, you know, people upload beats.
0:06:03 - 0:06:05::We could just upload freestyle.
0:06:05 - 0:06:06::You know what I'm saying?
0:06:06 - 0:06:07::Oh, yeah.
0:06:07 - 0:06:08::The lyrics.
0:06:08 - 0:06:10::And like, oh, should I have a crazy.
0:06:10 - 0:06:11::Yeah.
0:06:11 - 0:06:12::Yeah.
0:06:12 - 0:06:32::If you're a producer out there that doesn't like to go by any beats per minute, but more by,
0:06:32 - 0:06:35::like, somebody's ability to think in real time.
0:06:35 - 0:06:37::And without sticking to any rhythm.
0:06:37 - 0:06:38::Yeah.
0:06:38 - 0:06:39::Yeah.
0:06:39 - 0:06:47::And by the way, if you're thinking about how to score it, like, I love all type of rap.
0:06:47 - 0:06:49::And I like all type of beats.
0:06:49 - 0:06:58::But I'm thinking, like, what if you did instead of drums or just like drum and bass underneath
0:06:58 - 0:07:07::rap of violin or put just whatever, um, I tell you to low, it's a bass.
0:07:07 - 0:07:08::Eric.
0:07:08 - 0:07:14::Eric, you need to become a producer, I think.
0:07:14 - 0:07:18::I was thinking this last night, I'm not kidding you.
0:07:18 - 0:07:19::Because you don't need music.
0:07:19 - 0:07:23::You don't need musical talent to be a producer, okay?
0:07:23 - 0:07:24::You don't need to know.
0:07:24 - 0:07:25::I do have it.
0:07:25 - 0:07:28::Well, you don't, which is a little bit of a bonus.
0:07:28 - 0:07:29::Right.
0:07:29 - 0:07:30::No, you don't.
0:07:30 - 0:07:32::You never heard of this guy named Rick Rubin?
0:07:32 - 0:07:33::Of course.
0:07:33 - 0:07:35::He's kind of got some sex crimes.
0:07:35 - 0:07:36::I don't know.
0:07:36 - 0:07:37::Doesn't he?
0:07:37 - 0:07:38::No.
0:07:38 - 0:07:39::I don't know.
0:07:39 - 0:07:40::No, no, no.
0:07:40 - 0:07:41::I think I'm thinking of someone else.
0:07:41 - 0:07:42::The guy with the big beard.
0:07:42 - 0:07:43::He's, okay.
0:07:43 - 0:07:48::Anyways, he's one of like the, if you look at a list of the greatest music producers of all
0:07:48 - 0:07:50.880000::time, I guarantee you he's going to be on this list.
0:07:50.880000 - 0:07:56.560000::And this guy doesn't know a damn thing about music.
0:07:56.560000 - 0:07:58.360000::He doesn't know how to work a board.
0:07:58.360000 - 0:07:59.960000::He just basically just sits back.
0:07:59.960000 - 0:08:00.960000::I don't know what he does.
0:08:00.960000 - 0:08:02.520000::He just kind of hangs back.
0:08:02.520000 - 0:08:06.360000::And I think he just keeps the vibe right for these artists.
0:08:06.360000 - 0:08:07.360000::Right.
0:08:07.360000 - 0:08:13.480000::And maybe orders like good, you know, Chinese food or whatever food that, I think they, I
0:08:13.480000 - 0:08:17.640000::don't know what a producer does if they don't have musical talent to be honest.
0:08:17.640000 - 0:08:19.440000::I think ordering Chinese food is right.
0:08:19.800000 - 0:08:24.640000::Like they just order good food and they just kind of make sure everything's flounderic.
0:08:24.640000 - 0:08:25.640000::You got that.
0:08:25.640000 - 0:08:32.040000::I feel a larger, a larger phenomenon to me because he's basically a vibe creator, an environment
0:08:32.040000 - 0:08:33.200000::creator.
0:08:33.200000 - 0:08:38.100000::And it's like if you put some anybody in the right environment, something unique and
0:08:38.100000 - 0:08:40.120000::artful is going to come from it.
0:08:40.120000 - 0:08:43.600000::So you could put some, a bunch of losers in the best environment on the planet.
0:08:43.600000 - 0:08:47::And they're going to come up with something.
0:08:47 - 0:08:49.760000::And by the way, the right vibes and food.
0:08:49.760000 - 0:08:50.760000::Exactly.
0:08:50.760000 - 0:08:55.280000::And by the way, I'll just say this vibes our food.
0:08:55.280000 - 0:08:58.920000::Ingredients in food, you think of that as a recipe with different foods.
0:08:58.920000 - 0:09:00.960000::And this thoughts him a little tough for me.
0:09:00.960000 - 0:09:14.400000::But a vibe is basically a recipe of intermolecular ingredients that you need to set because
0:09:14.400000 - 0:09:16.240000::how often does this happen?
0:09:16.240000 - 0:09:19.880000::You eat something and you're in a bad mood and it tastes worse.
0:09:19.880000 - 0:09:26.840000::So in a sense, your mood is an ingredient in every bite you take.
0:09:26.840000 - 0:09:29.480000::Need I say that whole thing again?
0:09:29.480000 - 0:09:33.280000::Need I that I've they dealt with those themes on the menu.
0:09:33.280000 - 0:09:36.120000::I feel like sometimes I'm say what?
0:09:36.120000 - 0:09:37.120000::Oh, that movie.
0:09:37.120000 - 0:09:38.120000::Yeah, the menu.
0:09:38.120000 - 0:09:45.320000::Yeah, that if you have not seen the menu, go to HBO Max right now, open up the movie and
0:09:45.320000 - 0:09:46.320000::watch it right now.
0:09:46.320000 - 0:09:47.320000::It's amazing.
0:09:47.320000 - 0:09:51.320000::Talk to bottom acting and writing combined in the editor.
0:09:51.320000 - 0:09:52.320000::Yeah.
0:09:52.320000 - 0:09:55.320000::You'll realize that rich people can go fuck themselves.
0:09:55.320000 - 0:09:56.320000::That's a lot of your top music.
0:09:56.320000 - 0:09:57.320000::I accept for us.
0:09:57.320000 - 0:09:59.880000::Hey, 99.9% of rich people.

0:10:00 - 0:10:05::Let me let that be said right now in the podcast. I don't fuck with the rich.
0:10:05 - 0:10:22::But, but you said that 99% but there is the 1% of the 1% there's a couple of rich people out there that are kind of amazing to hang out with and we love to talk with y'all.
0:10:22 - 0:10:31::Yeah, those are celebrities and we have yes and we also have a lot of amazing ideas that I think you could invest in with us.
0:10:31 - 0:10:36::Alright Nate, I gotta hear it man.

0:10:53 - 0:11:07::Oh my god. There's a whole family driving home from the right now. They can't believe I'm going this far.
0:11:07 - 0:11:14::We might need to that might need to stay in just to show everybody that we're not even capping. You know what I'm saying?
0:11:14 - 0:11:20::Because that was pretty crazy right? Right. Yeah, it'd be capped to the sense of that no crap.
0:11:20 - 0:11:31::I was nervous about my energy coming into this podcast just because of all the alcohol I've had this weekend but we're cooking with gas right now.
0:11:31 - 0:11:44::And freestyle and feels free styling. If you're listening to this podcast, pause it and hit a verse real quick because it feels so therapeutic because it's all of us the only time in your life when you are not judging yourself.
0:11:44 - 0:11:47::Yo, can we able to think what am I about to think?

0:11:56 - 0:12:07::But I think what we should do is put a beat on just for the next like 20 seconds for the podcast is just a beat.

0:13:59 - 0:14:02::Like, oh, imagine you're being you're walking on the train.
0:14:02 - 0:14:04::You're on the literal subway.
0:14:04 - 0:14:08::And you just start wrapping right out loud. People are like, what the fuck?
0:14:08 - 0:14:13::And you're like, yeah, this is I'm listening to a podcast actually.
0:14:13 - 0:14:21::And that's how they we and that's how the word spreads word of mouth, which is we're not doing any advertising with this podcast.
0:14:21 - 0:14:24::We don't give a fuck about marketing.
0:14:24 - 0:14:30::This is purely word of mouth because if you liked it, go ahead and tell somebody.
0:14:30 - 0:14:33::I just liked it. And they're going to let's do it.
0:14:33 - 0:14:35::And they're going to like it. And guess what?
0:14:35 - 0:14:37::They're going to tell somebody that they liked it.
0:14:37 - 0:14:40::And they're going to tell and it just goes on and on and on.
0:14:40 - 0:14:46::And that's how we and that's how we grow this podcast into this is how we grow this podcast into guess what?
0:14:46 - 0:14:49::Smart list. We're coming for you.
0:14:49 - 0:14:51::Hi, we see you.
0:14:51 - 0:14:55::But we'll also get real smart list. What's that special? Okay.
0:14:55 - 0:14:56::Yeah.
0:14:56 - 0:15:00::And by the way, let me say that every every word is of mouth.

0:15:00 - 0:15:02.600000::is what you just made me think.
0:15:02.600000 - 0:15:04.480000::Word of mouth, every word is of mouth,
0:15:04.480000 - 0:15:05.680000::unless it's written, I guess.
0:15:05.680000 - 0:15:07.680000::So maybe it should be word of brain,
0:15:07.680000 - 0:15:09.600000::word of personal brain, interperson.
0:15:10.600000 - 0:15:11.920000::Should we move on to the next topic?
0:15:11.920000 - 0:15:15.120000::Yeah, we got the Harry Potter video game
0:15:15.120000 - 0:15:17.400000::and all the drama that surrounds it.
0:15:17.400000 - 0:15:20.320000::We just wanna say on the podcast that we are all gamers
0:15:20.320000 - 0:15:23::and we know that this is a weird time
0:15:23 - 0:15:24.440000::if you're a fan of Harry Potter
0:15:24.440000 - 0:15:26.840000::but you also don't like dick it rowing.
0:15:26.880000 - 0:15:30.640000::So yeah, I guess we're just trying to have a round table
0:15:30.640000 - 0:15:33.400000::right now, what's gonna, are you guys gonna buy the game?
0:15:33.400000 - 0:15:36.160000::Are you gonna buy the game and donate to a good cause?
0:15:36.160000 - 0:15:37.640000::Or are you going to buy the game
0:15:37.640000 - 0:15:40.280000::and bring the fuck outta that shit on YouTube live?
0:15:41.280000 - 0:15:43.840000::Or you're gonna buy the game and then play the game
0:15:43.840000 - 0:15:46.960000::in a way that is kind of sticking it to JK Rowling.
0:15:46.960000 - 0:15:51.840000::Oh, well you kind of defile her creative creations
0:15:51.840000 - 0:15:53.240000::within the game.
0:15:53.240000 - 0:15:54.080000::Exactly.
0:15:54.080000 - 0:15:55.760000::Or are you gonna hack the game and just,
0:15:55.760000 - 0:15:59.080000::yo, if I had my way, click, click, click, click, click,
0:15:59.080000 - 0:16:03.920000::hop on my computer, go into the database that makes the game
0:16:03.920000 - 0:16:08.920000::and put all type of bugs and then the game comes out.
0:16:11.160000 - 0:16:15.160000::Uh oh, I can't fucking walk up the stairs on this level.
0:16:15.160000 - 0:16:18.480000::Well, that was me and I'll put my name on it like Banksy
0:16:18.480000 - 0:16:19.800000::to show you know what I've done.
0:16:20.800000 - 0:16:22.680000::That's my protest.
0:16:22.680000 - 0:16:25::That's the big mistake with open world concept
0:16:25.080000 - 0:16:26.120000::of the world video games.
0:16:26.120000 - 0:16:26.880000::Yeah.
0:16:26.880000 - 0:16:28.880000::You're letting, you're leaving yourself open to people
0:16:28.880000 - 0:16:33.080000::like Eric adding a cave of truth where he puts you on blast.
0:16:34.040000 - 0:16:37.040000::You, cause you, people think hacking is so complicated
0:16:37.040000 - 0:16:39.280000::whatever and for some people it is.
0:16:39.280000 - 0:16:41.120000::For me, I was able to learn a lot of this shit
0:16:41.120000 - 0:16:43.520000::really quickly through my jobs and whatever
0:16:43.520000 - 0:16:44.480000::on the internet.
0:16:44.480000 - 0:16:48.360000::You could just go into the main file and delete,
0:16:48.360000 - 0:16:50.720000::delete, delete and that'll fuck up there shit enough
0:16:50.720000 - 0:16:52.400000::if you just delete enough and write enough,
0:16:52.400000 - 0:16:54.040000::gobbity good.
0:16:54.040000 - 0:16:55.760000::It'll destroy their code.
0:16:56.760000 - 0:16:57.280000::Okay.
0:16:57.280000 - 0:17:00.880000::If you, if you Google Eric Rayhill calculator,
0:17:00.880000 - 0:17:04.800000::you there an article from 2001 will come out of 11 year old
0:17:04.800000 - 0:17:07.320000::Eric Rayhill 10, 10 year old Eric Rayhill.
0:17:07.320000 - 0:17:07.840000::Yeah.
0:17:07.840000 - 0:17:10.840000::Hacking a calculator so intensely that he disrupted
0:17:10.840000 - 0:17:13.640000::a crazy election that you haven't heard about
0:17:13.640000 - 0:17:16.440000::because they had to burn the election.
0:17:16.440000 - 0:17:19.720000::And I hated that picture because basically I looked so,
0:17:19.720000 - 0:17:22.280000::my eyes are thrown way back to the back of my head.
0:17:22.880000 - 0:17:24.880000::You don't want to get a wide spot with eyeballs
0:17:24.880000 - 0:17:26.520000::and there's like blur up my hands
0:17:26.520000 - 0:17:29.160000::because my fingers are calculating so fast.
0:17:29.160000 - 0:17:33.080000::So let me set out a scenario for you.
0:17:33.080000 - 0:17:34.680000::All right.
0:17:34.680000 - 0:17:39.680000::Eric, you are sort of an underground hacker, okay?
0:17:40.680000 - 0:17:45.440000::You're one of the top hackers on the face of the planet
0:17:45.440000 - 0:17:49.280000::and you are doing these crazy social justice hacks
0:17:49.280000 - 0:17:51.920000::where you are hacking into Chase Bank
0:17:51.920000 - 0:17:55.320000::into the Kruger infrastructure, whatever.
0:17:55.320000 - 0:18:00.320000::And you are doing basically amazing things via hacking.
0:18:00.880000 - 0:18:05.880000::You get a call up from a kind of distorted voice
0:18:06.400000 - 0:18:07.920000::and it's the CIA.
0:18:07.920000 - 0:18:11.520000::And they say we have a bullet.
0:18:11.520000 - 0:18:12.680000::We have a bullet.
0:18:12.680000 - 0:18:16.520000::Sorry, we have a laser pointed at your fucking head
0:18:16.520000 - 0:18:18.920000::and you have two options.
0:18:18.920000 - 0:18:22.080000::You either die or you come work for us
0:18:22.080000 - 0:18:25.280000::and you can hack into the Russian government.
0:18:25.280000 - 0:18:27.240000::You might not be doing the best stuff,
0:18:27.240000 - 0:18:30.240000::but you're gonna live and maybe you can change
0:18:30.240000 - 0:18:32.320000::and make some change on the inside.
0:18:32.320000 - 0:18:34.080000::You know what I'm saying?
0:18:34.080000 - 0:18:35.800000::What are your options?
0:18:35.800000 - 0:18:38.520000::And I have a prediction for which one you're going to choose.
0:18:38.520000 - 0:18:40.600000::Yeah, here's what I do.
0:18:41.520000 - 0:18:43.320000::Let's see, I pick up the phone.
0:18:43.320000 - 0:18:46.040000::Hello, and I enter on a phone they've never heard of.
0:18:46.040000 - 0:18:48.600000::It's a different phone than the one they're calling.
0:18:48.600000 - 0:18:50.240000::And like, how are you making this happen?
0:18:50.240000 - 0:18:51.880000::I say, don't ask questions.
0:18:52.880000 - 0:18:58.200000::I list my bank account, whatever, 789, Chase, Chase, checking.
0:18:58.240000 - 0:19:01.800000::I said deposit $200 in their right ass now
0:19:01.800000 - 0:19:05.640000::and you might have a chance, whatever, I see $200.
0:19:07.520000 - 0:19:09.920000::Well, $200 and what current?
0:19:09.920000 - 0:19:10.440000::USD.
0:19:10.440000 - 0:19:11.440000::French.
0:19:11.440000 - 0:19:12.440000::Earth.
0:19:12.440000 - 0:19:15.320000::Year, euro, whatever, euro currency.
0:19:15.320000 - 0:19:16.440000::Because it's worth more.
0:19:16.440000 - 0:19:17.280000::It's worth more.
0:19:17.280000 - 0:19:20.280000::I'm not sure, but I get the notification, I say,
0:19:20.280000 - 0:19:22.240000::all right, you got me for two hours.
0:19:22.240000 - 0:19:24.800000::What country do you want to take down?
0:19:24.800000 - 0:19:27.800000::Their eyes are glow, females and men.
0:19:27.800000 - 0:19:29.880000::Yeah, because they have all the type of diverse people
0:19:29.880000 - 0:19:31.640000::on the squads now.
0:19:31.640000 - 0:19:35.160000::And basically, yeah, do show them what's good
0:19:35.160000 - 0:19:37.080000::and then I think I'd fall in love
0:19:37.080000 - 0:19:38.840000::with working for them really.
0:19:38.840000 - 0:19:41::Because people hate American government and all this,
0:19:41 - 0:19:43.680000::but we don't know what's going on behind the scenes
0:19:43.680000 - 0:19:45.440000::and that we think it's all nefarious,
0:19:45.440000 - 0:19:48.040000::but the CIA could be pulling good strings too.
0:19:48.040000 - 0:19:49.280000::That's what we forget.
0:19:49.280000 - 0:19:51.400000::That's what conspiracy theorists don't think about
0:19:51.400000 - 0:19:53.760000::is like, what good strings were they pulling?
0:19:53.760000 - 0:19:55.360000::And who did they kill that actually
0:19:55.360000 - 0:19:58.560000::that saved 10 million people down the road?
0:19:58.560000 - 0:20:00.680000::So if the CIA is listening to this,

0:20:00 - 0:20:05.200000::this. Thank you. Thank you. What you get literally you don't hear this
0:20:05.200000 - 0:20:09.080000::nothing you get roasted on a lot of podcasts. Not this one. We don't give a
0:20:09.080000 - 0:20:12.520000::fuck what you've done. Well, actually, we do give a fuck about the good
0:20:12.520000 - 0:20:16.800000::things that you've done. And we pray is God for you and in all your
0:20:16.800000 - 0:20:21.040000::families. So stay safe. God bless the C.A. You have such a good point
0:20:21.240000 - 0:20:26.200000::that we strip a lot of these people of their humanity. A lot of
0:20:26.200000 - 0:20:31.200000::people on the right. We say you are evil. You are bad. But it's more
0:20:31.200000 - 0:20:34.200000::complex than that. It's and we are three people. Even though we are
0:20:34.200000 - 0:20:38.200000::three of the most liberal fucking people you ever met and you're fucking
0:20:38.200000 - 0:20:43.200000::Buddha. You can you can't get more left. This is Peter Buttigieg. Come on
0:20:43.200000 - 0:20:48.200000::the pod cast. Pete Buttigieg just want let's just let you know. Let
0:20:48.200000 - 0:20:53.200000::me speak to camera right now. Yo Pete. We fuck with you so heavy
0:20:53.200000 - 0:20:57.200000::man. Yeah. Come on the pod. We want to talk about transportation
0:20:57.200000 - 0:21:00.200000::because we have a lot of thoughts on that shit. And I will say this if I
0:21:00.200000 - 0:21:04.200000::had my way, I would do a hot ones type challenge with Pete Buttigieg.
0:21:04.200000 - 0:21:10.200000::But instead of hot spices, it's shots. And there's 21 shots lined
0:21:10.200000 - 0:21:13.200000::up. And we go through and it's all the different types of liquor
0:21:13.200000 - 0:21:17.200000::vodka. Jen whiskey peanut butter whiskey. All of them all the way
0:21:17.200000 - 0:21:23.200000::down the line. 21. And it's a five hour podcast. And by the
0:21:23.200000 - 0:21:29.200000::end we're all slashed up and laughing and Eric, you might like
0:21:29.200000 - 0:21:34.200000::this phrase. What? It's a Latin phrase called in veto veritas.
0:21:34.200000 - 0:21:39.200000::What does that mean? That means live truthfully. It means in liquor
0:21:39.200000 - 0:21:45.200000::there is truth. What? And new tattoo is in drop. In liquor
0:21:45.200000 - 0:21:51.200000::there's two tattoos. Yeah. That is a higher ass tattoo to get on
0:21:51.200000 - 0:21:55.200000::your face on your throat. What's it? What is it called in veto veritas?
0:21:55.200000 - 0:22:01.200000::In veto veritas. So that is kind of an ancient style of behaving
0:22:01.200000 - 0:22:05.200000::in a way of being where they believe that if they got fucking
0:22:05.200000 - 0:22:10.200000::wasted, there would be a little bit more truth in the meetings
0:22:10.200000 - 0:22:16.200000::that they were having. So they did not shy away from having the
0:22:16.200000 - 0:22:22.200000::barrel of red wine in the kind of Greek style, whatever style of
0:22:22.200000 - 0:22:25.200000::government that they had. They were getting fucked up and talking about
0:22:25.200000 - 0:22:28.200000::the issues back then because they were a little bit more honest.
0:22:28.200000 - 0:22:33.200000::And I think if we had Pete Buttigieg on the pod and got him really
0:22:33.200000 - 0:22:36.200000::fucked up, I think we could solve a lot of these issues because he
0:22:36.200000 - 0:22:42.200000::would be a little bit more of a flow state and give us kind of the
0:22:42.200000 - 0:22:45.200000::real use of what's going on, how he really feels. Because we know
0:22:45.200000 - 0:22:49.200000::you're capping. I want to give it's hard to give a f about the
0:22:49.200000 - 0:22:53.200000::BS when you're turned right. Right. Right. Right.
0:22:53.200000 - 0:22:57.200000::I just imagine a movie about because you know, I feel like
0:22:57.200000 - 0:23:00.200000::movies failed to capture the real lives of politicians and how
0:23:00.200000 - 0:23:03.200000::much work they really do for us. And I was thinking back to my
0:23:03.200000 - 0:23:06.200000::calculating that my calculating picture of my eyes are thrown back
0:23:06.200000 - 0:23:10.200000::to the back of my head. It's all white. Imagine a scene where
0:23:10.200000 - 0:23:14.200000::they're making policy making and whatever editing bills like
0:23:14.200000 - 0:23:18.200000::super sick and Pete Buttigieg is sat in his living room, chase
0:23:18.200000 - 0:23:23.200000::his put the kids to bed. And Pete is sitting there and he's like
0:23:23.200000 - 0:23:27.200000::getting into the fucking it's like almost anime. He's getting into
0:23:27.200000 - 0:23:31.200000::the to the flow state with with lawmaking. He's got hell of
0:23:31.200000 - 0:23:35.200000::papers. His eyes go to the back of his head. He's got two
0:23:35.200000 - 0:23:38.200000::pencils and a pencil in each hand. He's writing crazy ass
0:23:38.200000 - 0:23:43.200000::laws, crazy ass proposals. His eyes start to be bleeding and get
0:23:43.200000 - 0:23:47.200000::really varicose. And then and what he writes actually saves
0:23:47.200000 - 0:23:52.200000::America from the heads of interior feedering off over the last
0:23:52.200000 - 0:23:56.200000::years. Crazy try and he writes some crazy laws about racism and
0:23:56.200000 - 0:24:00.200000::alternative types of policy. And that I would watch a whole
0:24:00.200000 - 0:24:07.200000::movie about that. The whole thing I'm starting to get confused
0:24:07.200000 - 0:24:12.200000::about what we're talking about. Well, that's absolutely no.
0:24:12.200000 - 0:24:16.200000::That's actually we're talking about a Pete Buttigieg star in a
0:24:16.200000 - 0:24:20.200000::movie where he gets what does he do? He gets so fucked up in the
0:24:20.200000 - 0:24:24.200000::office that he his fingers. He'd like to be dexterous writing at
0:24:24.200000 - 0:24:27.200000::the same time and then his eyes start bleeding and then he comes out with a
0:24:27.200000 - 0:24:30.200000::anti racism bill. It's a first draft. It's a first draft.
0:24:30.200000 - 0:24:35.200000::It's a first draft. It has to be confusing at this stage.
0:24:35.200000 - 0:24:39.200000::Yeah. But as we refine it, it gets clear and working
0:24:39.200000 - 0:24:43.200000::size and story. But what is important right now is that the
0:24:43.200000 - 0:24:47.200000::nugget is there. And that's all you need to have a fire fucking movie
0:24:47.200000 - 0:24:52.200000::is that nugget of creativity, which Eric, I feel like your creativity
0:24:52.200000 - 0:24:57.200000::there was kind of crazy. And it's kind of raw.
0:24:57.200000 - 0:24:59.200000::All you need me feel ashamed by saying
0:24:59.200000 - 0:25:00.200000::you're not.

0:25:00 - 0:25:03.640000::but you know, really, no, I don't have ego.
0:25:04.160000 - 0:25:05.760000::I haven't had an ego for years.
0:25:08.320000 - 0:25:09.280000::It's interesting, man.
0:25:09.280000 - 0:25:12.440000::The way you say that phrase, you know, the second you don't think your ego's
0:25:12.440000 - 0:25:16.600000::there, I would just say, look behind your shoulder because there might be a large
0:25:16.600000 - 0:25:17.840000::yellow lemon type figure.
0:25:17.840000 - 0:25:18.760000::Look at how you wonder.
0:25:18.760000 - 0:25:22.880000::And are you confident there?
0:25:22.920000 - 0:25:29.960000::I can say objectively there is all three of us are have zero.
0:25:30 - 0:25:32.320000::Ego at all.
0:25:32.320000 - 0:25:39.720000::There is none, not even a not even a morsel of ego is involved in three of us.
0:25:39.720000 - 0:25:42.400000::And that's why people like us a lot.
0:25:42.400000 - 0:25:46.800000::And that's why they fuck with us because we don't have this thing standing
0:25:46.800000 - 0:25:48.520000::between me and you.
0:25:48.520000 - 0:25:49.480000::Okay.
0:25:49.480000 - 0:25:50.480000::We're all one.
0:25:51.320000 - 0:25:56.120000::That's why when we go to events where celebrities are there, they look at us
0:25:56.440000 - 0:26:00.600000::and they can sense something in us that they don't have, which is just a pure
0:26:00.600000 - 0:26:05.120000::sense of self-assuredness, no need for external validation.
0:26:05.480000 - 0:26:07.360000::And people are weirdly attracted to that.
0:26:07.360000 - 0:26:10::There's there's ego and not having ego, you know what I mean?
0:26:10.640000 - 0:26:14.640000::And we kind of have that where we are, I'm very proud of not being ego.
0:26:15.200000 - 0:26:23.880000::And can I say that I was just next to a celebrity, very extremely recently.
0:26:24.360000 - 0:26:28.120000::One of the most famous people to ever live.
0:26:29.360000 - 0:26:36.560000::And I was at, I was at an Italian restaurant, a very nice one.
0:26:37.400000 - 0:26:44.240000::And I was treating my girl to a nice little dinner like I do as I do.
0:26:44.560000 - 0:26:45.560000::And as I should.
0:26:46.520000 - 0:26:51.840000::And who was next to me, but miss Jane Fonda,
0:26:52 - 0:26:54.400000::icon legend.
0:26:55.440000 - 0:27:00.640000::And I was kind of, you know, given a couple of takes just to be like, Oh,
0:27:00.640000 - 0:27:03.160000::shit, Jane Fonda's next to me, but I didn't get up.
0:27:03.160000 - 0:27:06.640000::I didn't say anything because of course I'm respectful.
0:27:06.680000 - 0:27:07.880000::I respect their space.
0:27:07.880000 - 0:27:14.400000::And I was thinking if there is somebody in this fucking restaurant who goes up to
0:27:14.400000 - 0:27:19.240000::Jane Fonda and says, Oh, like just, just don't.
0:27:19.720000 - 0:27:23.840000::And I saw somebody get up, go over to her.
0:27:24.680000 - 0:27:26.920000::And I was like, good God, are you kidding me?
0:27:26.920000 - 0:27:28.760000::Just leave her alone, right?
0:27:28.960000 - 0:27:30.640000::Leave her the fuck alone.
0:27:31.120000 - 0:27:34::And I looked over and who was that person?
0:27:34.720000 - 0:27:37.120000::The head mother fucking chef.
0:27:38.680000 - 0:27:44.880000::And he was checking in and giving her special meals and saying, did you like my food?
0:27:45.400000 - 0:27:53.400000::And I was thinking how amazing would that be to be at that level where you go to
0:27:53.480000 - 0:27:59.040000::restaurant and you are so important that the chef wants to come up to you and
0:27:59.040000 - 0:28:04.280000::give you little treats that aren't on the menu and make sure you're doing well.
0:28:04.920000 - 0:28:08.760000::And basically give you that special type of treatment.
0:28:09 - 0:28:09.960000::Wouldn't that be nice?
0:28:10.560000 - 0:28:11.560000::That way.
0:28:11.800000 - 0:28:12.320000::Yeah, go ahead.
0:28:12.320000 - 0:28:19.160000::I was just going to say, man, if you come to my house, that's how I'm going to treat you.
0:28:20.200000 - 0:28:20.720000::Trust me.
0:28:23.360000 - 0:28:26.440000::Dan, everyone is a celebrity to you is what you're saying.
0:28:26.800000 - 0:28:32.040000::What I mean is to be treated so specially when somebody who you love and you know
0:28:32.040000 - 0:28:34.920000::personally treats you that way every day.
0:28:36.120000 - 0:28:39.680000::If somebody treated you that way in a restaurant who is a stranger, you'd recognize it,
0:28:39.680000 - 0:28:45.320000::but when it's someone you love, why is it harder to recognize what they did for you?
0:28:46.640000 - 0:28:47.320000::What is that?
0:28:47.560000 - 0:28:52.080000::Why don't we appreciate validation from the people we see every day, but we appreciate it
0:28:52.080000 - 0:28:56.360000::from strangers who would run us over in the road.
0:28:56.760000 - 0:29:03.160000::If there was a expensive product somewhere for them, because what is that about?
0:29:03.160000 - 0:29:06.400000::Because there is something enticing about the one you want to do.
0:29:07.480000 - 0:29:08.720000::You see what I mean by this?
0:29:09.200000 - 0:29:10.120000::Like you want to kill you?
0:29:10.120000 - 0:29:14.560000::We know that our that our family, not that, not that.
0:29:14.600000 - 0:29:15.200000::Not that.
0:29:16.640000 - 0:29:20.720000::We know that our family loves us and our friends love us nearly unconditionally.
0:29:20.920000 - 0:29:24.280000::If you guys, anything ever comes out about you guys, I love you unconditionally,
0:29:24.280000 - 0:29:28.400000::even if I block you on Insta Twitter and say horrible things about you,
0:29:28.400000 - 0:29:31.560000::you know that deep down, I love you unconditionally.
0:29:32.840000 - 0:29:38.640000::But with strangers, it's always about getting a taste of what a vet person over there
0:29:38.640000 - 0:29:39.120000::like me.
0:29:39.120000 - 0:29:40.280000::I don't know what they're like.
0:29:40.280000 - 0:29:45.360000::And if this stranger, this mysterious person likes me and I don't know their flaws,
0:29:45.360000 - 0:29:47.400000::I don't know what makes them not that trustworthy.
0:29:47.400000 - 0:29:54.240000::I don't know whatever this person represents, you know, that I'm going to see where I'm going.
0:29:54.240000 - 0:29:54.720000::Yes.
0:29:57.240000 - 0:29:57.920000::You got it, man.
0:29:57.920000 - 0:29:58.440000::You got it.
0:29:58.960000 - 0:30:00::I want to.

0:30:00 - 0:30:07.520000::I don't know, I want to apologize to everyone listening right now because yeah, I'm off one milligram right now of the
0:30:08.480000 - 0:30:14.720000::Zaza you're gonna say yeah, I am and it's been prescribed and I took a half of a 2mg mint and
0:30:15.440000 - 0:30:20.160000::I won't do it again. I really I won't disrespect you guys like this again
0:30:21.280000 - 0:30:24.800000::It's not cool. I'm trying to ween off one and I wanted a
0:30:25.360000 - 0:30:30.640000::Forfinger pour a liquor really badly and I said no man go have a little bit of the
0:30:31.760000 - 0:30:37.040000::You know CBD THC whatever and obviously I can't I can't cope so
0:30:37.840000 - 0:30:43.360000::I'll just stop talking for the podcast and wherever you guys here. No, dude. No, I appreciate no Nate. No Nate
0:30:43.360000 - 0:30:48.720000::I appreciate that Eric because a year ago or so before you had dealt with this issue
0:30:49.200000 - 0:30:52::I can see it going differently where you would have lied in that moment
0:30:52.080000 - 0:30:55.120000::You would have had the thought and then spun out and then you would go and shit shit
0:30:55.120000 - 0:31:00.160000::How do I save face? How do I not take deal with what's gonna happen to the consequences right and you just said
0:31:00.800000 - 0:31:05.440000::Oh my god, I'm so sorry guys something just smashed through my window. I gotta go deal with it
0:31:05.600000 - 0:31:08.240000::Oh man, but I appreciate that you're
0:31:09.360000 - 0:31:14.400000::Owning up to it in the moment and I'm not gonna baby you so if you do talk again go ahead
0:31:14.480000 - 0:31:17.760000::But I want 20 bucks for every 30 seconds you take for the rest of the thing
0:31:18.240000 - 0:31:19.760000::Wow
0:31:19.840000 - 0:31:21.840000::I just say this you what
0:31:22.560000 - 0:31:24.240000::What we are
0:31:24.240000 - 0:31:26.880000::Hearing right now is called growth
0:31:28 - 0:31:33.280000::Okay, in a good way in a good way and honesty and
0:31:34.080000 - 0:31:35.200000::Also
0:31:35.200000 - 0:31:40.880000::Relateability I think a lot of people are going to be relating to what you just said here
0:31:41.200000 - 0:31:43.360000::I think so and they are going to be
0:31:44.320000 - 0:31:49.200000::Really relating to your honesty of what you just said right there
0:31:49.920000 - 0:31:54.720000::And the type of shit that you go through on a day-to-day basis and I think that that is
0:31:55.600000 - 0:32:01.200000::Actually going to connect harder with people and that's what we're trying to do is this is not a podcast
0:32:01.200000 - 0:32:05.520000::This is I think I might have said this before but this is a conversation right, okay?
0:32:06.160000 - 0:32:10.720000::And this is a dialogue that we're having with you listening right now
0:32:13.360000 - 0:32:19.680000::Do you guys think speaking of dialogue and vulnerability? Do you guys see a situation where you could cry?
0:32:20 - 0:32:22::For real on the podcast be crying
0:32:24.560000 - 0:32:29.120000::So I just listened to an interview with Brennan Frazier on Marmarine and Mark marine
0:32:30.720000 - 0:32:36.480000::Started crying pretty bad thinking about the whale movie the whale that just came out and I haven't seen it but
0:32:37.360000 - 0:32:39.360000::I bet that was sad as fun
0:32:39.760000 - 0:32:43.840000::It would let's it would take me I think a lot to
0:32:44.720000 - 0:32:48.240000::cry on the podcast but
0:32:48.560000 - 0:32:50.560000::I
0:32:50.560000 - 0:32:53.680000::Will say that I would like to get to the point where I could
0:32:54.640000 - 0:33:01.200000::Get to you know where I could do that and be vulnerable enough to let out some crazy tears
0:33:02.400000 - 0:33:03.680000::Like that, you know what I'm saying?
0:33:03.680000 - 0:33:10.080000::So shout out to mark marine for letting himself get to that point and be invulnerable with his emotions like that on the podcast
0:33:10.560000 - 0:33:15.840000::We fuck with you and we would really like to be on your pod and have you on hours as well and kind of do like a
0:33:16.800000 - 0:33:21.440000::You know a swap of sorts. Yeah, and can I say um
0:33:24.560000 - 0:33:27.520000::Dude I struggle not to cry every podcast man
0:33:28.640000 - 0:33:33.440000::Pretty much every second of this podcast. I'm trying really hard to keep it together
0:33:33.760000 - 0:33:39.280000::Right that's right. This is a different range of emotions and when I cry I pee so I can't be doing that either
0:33:39.280000 - 0:33:44.720000::This is a audio podcast right now in jack like we can see you right now and you're and I can see
0:33:45.200000 - 0:33:49.120000::So clearly it is so clear right now that you're fighting back
0:33:49.920000 - 0:33:51.120000::tears
0:33:51.120000 - 0:33:56.640000::Because and why are you crying because the joy of friendship is just so emotional to you right now
0:33:57.040000 - 0:34:00.480000::Three people connected this hard and this crazy on an on-beauty goes
0:34:01.840000 - 0:34:07.520000::So many different reasons man. I cry because I'm a grateful and then I start crying because like I want to
0:34:08.400000 - 0:34:12.800000::Say an idea that I have that I'm scared that people are gonna judge the fuck out of me
0:34:13.200000 - 0:34:16.480000::And then I'm scared that the way that I have this way that sound when I'm crying
0:34:16.640000 - 0:34:23.280000::I sound like shit and then I start crying again and then all of a sudden everybody thinks like I'm not good in the battle
0:34:23.680000 - 0:34:25.680000::I'm not a good guy for a battle combat
0:34:26.560000 - 0:34:29.040000::Oh, sorry. I just had to get that to fuck out
0:34:30.960000 - 0:34:34.800000::I had an embarrassing cry last week not full cry, but I
0:34:35.440000 - 0:34:40.520000::No first off no cry is embarrassing. No, this one was no question is stupid this one
0:34:41.320000 - 0:34:44.760000::I don't think it's embarrassing to cry when you're talking about it or feelings whatever
0:34:45.080000 - 0:34:54.600000::But I think it can be embarrassing to cry at certain media and I was I'm watching a new anime called the Tokyo Revengers if you guys heard of this
0:34:55.720000 - 0:35:00.040000::No, it's a bad guy who goes 12 years back in time 20s and mid

0:35:00 - 0:35:04.960000::school and his girlfriend dies in the future and he's trying to save his girlfriend and
0:35:05.840000 - 0:35:10.640000::Basically, he's like one of the kind of crybaby protagonist where they're kind of a loser
0:35:10.640000 - 0:35:13.600000::But they're really resilient and maybe they're not that strong
0:35:13.600000 - 0:35:18.680000::But they can be resilient against people beating the fuck out of them and that's kind of their superpower
0:35:18.680000 - 0:35:23.920000::And that's him and there's one part where he's like god of shit be out of him trying to change the future
0:35:24.640000 - 0:35:26.640000::by some other middle school and he's going
0:35:27.640000 - 0:35:30.320000::And he get an out and he gets up and he's like
0:35:31.360000 - 0:35:35.280000::And he's standing there and he's exhausted as fuck and he says some shit like
0:35:36.560000 - 0:35:41.960000::You know, he says his piece of the bully and then he like gets on the bully's back and starts biting the fuck out of the bully
0:35:42.200000 - 0:35:49.600000::Dirty stop and biting him biting him and the way that they make this happen the way that they animate it in the way that
0:35:50.160000 - 0:35:54.320000::Something happened to where I'm sitting there and I've just been eating my breakfast burrito trying to wash his
0:35:55.200000 - 0:36:00.800000::I'm feeling stinging at the corner of my eyes like I can't believe he's having the strength to do this right now
0:36:00.800000 - 0:36:07.440000::And I'm feeling a little bit of tears well up and that made me think when I felt a little bit of those tears coming
0:36:07.440000 - 0:36:16.040000::I didn't think oh, that's nice that I'm crying. I thought what is happening that I am being bold over this easily by some of this kind of shitty
0:36:16.720000 - 0:36:18.720000::You know what I mean and you're right
0:36:19.120000 - 0:36:21.120000::Kind of like how you see joy
0:36:21.920000 - 0:36:24.880000::It makes you manipulatable. I'm very manipulatable. I
0:36:26.200000 - 0:36:31.680000::Can be so easily manipulated by a sick person if someone with a real illness tried to manipulate me
0:36:32.320000 - 0:36:34.320000::They could give me
0:36:34.640000 - 0:36:38.560000::Well, that must make it tough living in New York City. So if you're listening right now
0:36:38.560000 - 0:36:42.880000::You're really sick and you know, you know kind of take advantage of somebody like just hit
0:36:43.600000 - 0:36:49.440000::Hit Eric's the air in my line that every single one and he's one of the most easy people to scam too. Oh, yeah
0:36:49.520000 - 0:36:53.920000::By the way, I do respond to every single DM. So if you DM me
0:36:54.400000 - 0:36:58.720000::I'll respond to you and we'll have a long conversation and I follow everybody back
0:37:00 - 0:37:05.600000::Follow this remind this reminds me is it do you guys think it's cool to hit on people of the gym?
0:37:06.480000 - 0:37:08.480000::No
0:37:09.120000 - 0:37:11.120000::Way
0:37:11.440000 - 0:37:13.680000::Get out of there let the people lift
0:37:15.360000 - 0:37:18.320000::Nate what do you think about this? Okay, so
0:37:19.280000 - 0:37:24.320000::Hitting on people at the gym. I had kind of a crazy style
0:37:24.960000 - 0:37:30.320000::Nathan for you business idea that I think one would have been amazing on the show
0:37:31.040000 - 0:37:35.360000::If I was right or for Nathan for you, I would have body date killed it and the show would have been better because of me
0:37:35.760000 - 0:37:38.240000::being on it anyways
0:37:38.320000 - 0:37:42.160000::This is a crazy business idea where the men in
0:37:43.120000 - 0:37:45.120000::Every gym have to wear glasses
0:37:46 - 0:37:47.120000::and
0:37:47.120000 - 0:37:54.240000::Everybody has sensors on their butt as well and if they glasses check you kind of looking at looking at people sexually
0:37:54.720000 - 0:37:57.520000::It buzzes them and you have to fucking leave
0:37:58.720000 - 0:38:03.840000::You know, I'm saying so it makes sure that the gym the gym can guarantee that there's nobody that's like
0:38:04.400000 - 0:38:10.560000::You know looking you up and down that's like fuck so you can just feel like you know when you're the gym you want to feel like
0:38:11.280000 - 0:38:14.800000::You could put your booty out as far as you want. No one's gonna start looking at it
0:38:15.360000 - 0:38:19.200000::And I think that totally you know, I've heard I've heard this express from
0:38:19.920000 - 0:38:25.280000::My partner and other women that they go to the gym and they can they can feel the eyes on them
0:38:25.280000 - 0:38:27.760000::You know what I'm saying and it's just not a place to be
0:38:29.040000 - 0:38:36::Well, let me say that let me let me uh, I want to do two things one. I love this idea. So I said then two
0:38:36.880000 - 0:38:38.080000::um
0:38:38.080000 - 0:38:44.720000::I want to take gender out of it immediately and I want to say everybody gets has to wear these glasses at this gym
0:38:45.200000 - 0:38:49.520000::And the glasses are a are augmented reality and if you look at somebody's booty
0:38:49.520000 - 0:38:53.360000::It's gonna show you your deepest darkest fear reflected back at you. Yeah, fuck you up
0:38:54.160000 - 0:38:57.680000::So that there's no such thing as checking people out with the Google Google glass
0:38:58.080000 - 0:39:00.800000::Google ask go like reverse ask Google glass
0:39:01.520000 - 0:39:03.840000::Reverse ask Google all right somebody else go
0:39:04 - 0:39:06::And my idea is this is
0:39:06.560000 - 0:39:11.840000::Each gym has five or six towers on them a ladder that goes up the top of the tower
0:39:12.480000 - 0:39:16.240000::And a little area and we have four five six seven snipers
0:39:16.960000 - 0:39:23.040000::All throughout the building lasers visible at all times and they're watching to see if any top of
0:39:23.760000 - 0:39:26.880000::Nefarious thing is going on and you get one look
0:39:27.680000 - 0:39:29.680000::Necap that's your warning
0:39:30 - 0:39:32::It's basically like pop
0:39:32.240000 - 0:39:34.240000::Right to the stomach that'll hurt
0:39:35.200000 - 0:39:37.520000::Another one pop right to the mouth
0:39:38.240000 - 0:39:39.760000::And that'll kill you
0:39:39.760000 - 0:39:41.760000::Unless your David Blank will catch it
0:39:42.240000 - 0:39:44.240000::In the mouth. Oh
0:39:44.240000 - 0:39:49.200000::In all the war I don't want to get to do some in all the wars that we have you don't think one person's caught a bullet in their teeth
0:39:50.480000 - 0:39:53.120000::In their teeth you mean like caught it
0:39:53.280000 - 0:39:55.600000::Well, I wanted about this because if it's going
0:39:56.080000 - 0:39:57.040000::Say
0:39:57.040000 - 0:40:00::This is like a physics problem. He shoot it from far back and up

0:40:00 - 0:40:08.360000::Eventually the bullets are just gonna lose steam and as anybody gotten hit by a bullet that's going slow enough to just kind of go
0:40:09.540000 - 0:40:16.180000::Wow down on the ground. I'm Googling how far away does a bullet start going slow. Oh it took me
0:40:18.400000 - 0:40:23.560000::External ballistics now this is too complicated. I don't find out from the next podcast. We'll do some research
0:40:25.160000 - 0:40:27.860000::I think that's a great idea, and I think that
0:40:27.860000 - 0:40:36.020000::Yeah, we need to change I think that something else we can do with this podcast is changed in culture in a way that is
0:40:37.220000 - 0:40:39.220000::truly
0:40:39.220000 - 0:40:45.900000::impactful and by the way in February I'm losing ten pounds and if I don't lose ten pounds
0:40:45.900000 - 0:40:48.500000::Not I don't need to do it for my image. I like better than I've ever looked
0:40:49.100000 - 0:40:52.020000::But if I don't lose ten pounds, I will
0:40:52.300000 - 0:41:01.220000::That's not funny. That's not that's that's actually not funny
0:41:01.220000 - 0:41:07.740000::It's not funny. I'm gonna and you know what did no we're gonna keep that we're gonna keep that in and we're gonna make it the colo
0:41:07.740000 - 0:41:11.940000::And you know what I think we should talk about
0:41:12.660000 - 0:41:19.060000::the basically our favorite segment of the show is a staple where we get to tell y'all
0:41:19.660000 - 0:41:23.020000::what brought us joy this week and
0:41:24.460000 - 0:41:26.460000::What brought me joy was
0:41:27.260000 - 0:41:29.260000::honestly looking at the
0:41:29.860000 - 0:41:32.260000::reviews of the podcast on
0:41:33.220000 - 0:41:39.700000::Apple podcast I was like these are kind of like I feel like the people that listen to this and I don't think this often
0:41:40.260000 - 0:41:47.540000::That people are you know funny online, but people were making me laugh in their reviews also being very kind
0:41:47.540000 - 0:41:56.020000::But also being hilarious and I'm thinking the people that listen to this are kind of amazing people and I really like what you guys are putting down
0:41:56.260000 - 0:42:01.100000::Comedically and in the positive vibe section as well. So thank you guys for I
0:42:01.780000 - 0:42:08.340000::Guess reviewing and being hilarious at the same time that that she was making me laugh and bring me a lot of joy
0:42:10.220000 - 0:42:11.460000::And
0:42:11.460000 - 0:42:14.980000::That's amazing they have my agreement. We have a bunch of goats
0:42:14.980000 - 0:42:21.100000::I've pastured goats listening to the podcast essentially and they're chewing on some amazing
0:42:22.740000 - 0:42:24.420000::podcast
0:42:24.420000 - 0:42:31.660000::But one brought me joy is essentially quite simple. It's also related to the podcast and what I've been be joyfully thinking about
0:42:32.140000 - 0:42:41.380000::It's all the celebrities that might be joining the podcast for it for a quick visit and who who's on our minds that breath
0:42:42.380000 - 0:42:43.380000::um
0:42:43.540000 - 0:42:47.780000::Sarah Chalk from scrub the whole cast of scrub we want to get on here at some point

0:42:51.060000 - 0:42:54.980000::You know just I'm literally every minute. I have a second of free time
0:42:54.980000 - 0:43:01.460000::Who could get on the pocket? What celebrity wants in the pocket? I want to meet a celebrity. I've never met a full on celebrity
0:43:02.420000 - 0:43:04.580000::And that's what I want to do. I want to meet
0:43:05.220000 - 0:43:09.700000::Tens of them on this podcast and we'll do it and you guys will get to hear our conversations
0:43:09.860000 - 0:43:15.620000::We'll ask them the shit that they don't want to talk about. We'll ask them about their worst secrets and all the bad shit that they have
0:43:15.620000 - 0:43:22.980000::Trying to cover up. You will be meeting so many celebrities that you will become jaded to the to what a celebrity is which I don't think
0:43:24.020000 - 0:43:26.740000::Any of us will get to that point, but I think you'll get close to it
0:43:28.420000 - 0:43:32.820000::And I know that we're in the mix of talking about having the entire cast of SNL on the
0:43:32.820000 - 0:43:34.340000::Oh my god
0:43:34.340000 - 0:43:35.380000::Yo

0:43:40.820000 - 0:43:44.340000::Yeah, and I think I meant to say in the midst I said in the mix but
0:43:45.060000 - 0:43:46.580000::Okay, Jack what brought you to it? Oh man
0:43:47.220000 - 0:43:48.660000::What brought me joy
0:43:48.660000 - 0:43:55.460000::Similarly to the podcast and related to the podcast but in a different way basically this week I am done with therapy
0:43:55.940000 - 0:44:01.140000::My I'm done doing therapy. I cut it out. It's not for financial reasons. I'm happy about it
0:44:01.380000 - 0:44:06.820000::And it's not for any other any reason other than that it worked. I'm done. I don't need it that shit anymore
0:44:07.780000 - 0:44:17.140000::Uh, that shit's cooked that shit's washed that shit's for bums and I'm onto the next one taken life on by the horns and not letting somebody else tell me how to live my life
0:44:17.140000 - 0:44:20.580000::So for the next couple months, I'm gonna be raw doggy in my motions
0:44:21.380000 - 0:44:29.780000::As the millennials tend to say online, but um no, I'm uh, yeah, I'm excited to go out there alone in the mental
0:44:30.500000 - 0:44:33.780000::Uh, Duncan donuts of the world
0:44:34.740000 - 0:44:39.140000::If that makes sense if it doesn't you know what to do hit me up tell me it didn't
0:44:40.340000 - 0:44:41.700000::All right
0:44:41.700000 - 0:44:45.300000::That's what brought us all joy unless you guys think I should do a different one
0:44:46.580000 - 0:44:48.580000::We hope you
0:44:48.580000 - 0:44:54.100000::We crushed it again and once again we came out with the fire podcast episode two
