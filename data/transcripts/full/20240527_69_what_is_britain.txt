0:01:56.560000 - 0:01:57.760000::All I was doing was enjoying it.
0:01:57.760000 - 0:02:00.280000::I just wanted to give you some space if you're, you know.
0:02:00.280000 - 0:02:01.520000::That's for sure.
0:02:01.520000 - 0:02:04.720000::Four people on the violins and cellos.
0:02:04.720000 - 0:02:07.520000::One person on the bass, one person on the keys.
0:02:07.520000 - 0:02:09.840000::There was a point where the guy who was rapping
0:02:09.840000 - 0:02:12.600000::all the Dr. Dre and Eminem parts all night,
0:02:12.600000 - 0:02:14.200000::his voice got tired.
0:02:14.200000 - 0:02:18::And so the pianist just played the moonlight sonata
0:02:18 - 0:02:20.080000::for a couple minutes and it was really fun.
0:02:20.080000 - 0:02:21.080000::Wow.
0:02:21.080000 - 0:02:22.960000::Eminem was beautiful.
0:02:22.960000 - 0:02:24.240000::This was at the Brooklyn Bowl.
0:02:24.240000 - 0:02:27.120000::This is at a bowling alley, yeah.
0:02:27.120000 - 0:02:30.480000::Yo, that place is kind of a member when we went there, Jack.
0:02:30.480000 - 0:02:31.480000::Yeah, that was awesome.
0:02:31.480000 - 0:02:32.480000::For the band Cove It.
0:02:32.480000 - 0:02:33.480000::Yeah, that was awesome.
0:02:33.480000 - 0:02:34.480000::Yeah, that was awesome.
0:02:34.480000 - 0:02:38.800000::Yeah, the food there is really, it's quite a fancy venue that place.
0:02:38.800000 - 0:02:41.320000::Yo, the food is popping.
0:02:41.320000 - 0:02:46.260000::You know what that makes me miss is corporate, like my office parties that would, they would
0:02:46.260000 - 0:02:50.680000::rent out a space like that a couple times a year, sometimes holiday parties, sometimes
0:02:50.680000 - 0:02:51.680000::not.
0:02:51.680000 - 0:02:57.160000::And just the way that you get faded at those events is like no other beer.
0:02:57.160000 - 0:03:00.480000::It turns, you know, it's almost a miraculous.
0:03:00.480000 - 0:03:02.520000::It's beer turns the water.
0:03:02.520000 - 0:03:03.520000::You're drinking that shit.
0:03:03.520000 - 0:03:08.360000::You're drinking that shit drunk in a frightening way at office parties.
0:03:08.360000 - 0:03:09.360000::Right.
0:03:09.360000 - 0:03:14.200000::And you, you honestly, this is a word to the wise if there's anybody out there that's
0:03:14.200000 - 0:03:15.800000::freshly 22.
0:03:15.800000 - 0:03:18.720000::They're just entered into the workforce.
0:03:18.720000 - 0:03:23.240000::Be careful at those parties because the your first one you're going to want to get, you're
0:03:23.240000 - 0:03:28.120000::going to want to get blackout drunk and talk to the director of sales and talk to the
0:03:28.120000 - 0:03:29.440000::fucking CEO.
0:03:29.440000 - 0:03:30.840000::You don't want to be that person.
0:03:30.840000 - 0:03:31.840000::All right.
0:03:31.840000 - 0:03:34.280000::Dip out immediately and go chill with your fucking friends.
0:03:34.280000 - 0:03:35.280000::All right.
0:03:35.280000 - 0:03:41.040000::You don't want to be in hour, like two or three of those parties because you don't like
0:03:41.040000 - 0:03:43.520000::what you see and you're not going to like who you become.
0:03:43.520000 - 0:03:46::I have the opposite advice.
0:03:46 - 0:03:49.480000::This is where you get to show people who you really are.
0:03:49.480000 - 0:03:51.920000::Most of the time these jobs are a drone.
0:03:51.920000 - 0:03:57.160000::People can get a sense of your personality through your, I'm a Leon Dore, Dore shirts
0:03:57.160000 - 0:03:59.240000::that you're wearing on Fridays.
0:03:59.240000 - 0:04:02.840000::They get a sense that you really get it and that you go to amazing restaurants and have
0:04:02.840000 - 0:04:04.840000::interesting friends outside of work.
0:04:04.840000 - 0:04:08.760000::But they don't really know who the hell you are until you get faded.
0:04:08.760000 - 0:04:09.760000::Until you're faded.
0:04:09.760000 - 0:04:11.560000::It's hell in front of them.
0:04:11.560000 - 0:04:12.560000::And.
0:04:12.560000 - 0:04:13.560000::Hey, Eric.
0:04:13.560000 - 0:04:17.280000::The way that you start talking shit when you're drunk like that at a party.
0:04:17.280000 - 0:04:19.360000::I mean, that's like heaven.
0:04:19.360000 - 0:04:24.040000::That's mana from heaven really for me.
0:04:24.040000 - 0:04:25.760000::That's what we miss out with Zoom culture.
0:04:25.760000 - 0:04:26.760000::What, what, what?
0:04:26.760000 - 0:04:28.760000::What's a melee on Dore?
0:04:28.760000 - 0:04:30.760000::A melee on Dore.
0:04:30.760000 - 0:04:32.600000::Oh, interesting question.
0:04:32.600000 - 0:04:35.600000::Well, you might want to see the side of Nate's hat wrong side.
0:04:35.600000 - 0:04:36.600000::Oh my God.
0:04:36.600000 - 0:04:37.600000::You got to really.
0:04:37.600000 - 0:04:41.040000::Is that, is that different?
0:04:41.040000 - 0:04:43.880000::You got to wear your hat like that the rest of the podcast.
0:04:43.880000 - 0:04:45.680000::Oh, I love it.
0:04:45.680000 - 0:04:46.680000::Normally.
0:04:46.680000 - 0:04:49.400000::This is kind of.
0:04:49.400000 - 0:04:53.480000::This was a brand that was, it's still awesome Nate and I just folded one on their shirts
0:04:53.480000 - 0:04:54.480000::over there.
0:04:54.480000 - 0:04:59.440000::But it was a brand that was pop hang when we got to New York in about 2018.
0:04:59.440000 - 0:05:00.040000::And I remember going.

0:05:00 - 0:05:02.240000::there with my new salary money from
0:05:02.240000 - 0:05:05.600000::Critia the company that I worked at
0:05:05.600000 - 0:05:08.340000::and I was like let me get a damn ass shirt.
0:05:08.340000 - 0:05:13.300000::A May Leon Doray so they're French and Italian maybe.
0:05:13.300000 - 0:05:16.040000::Something like that.
0:05:16.040000 - 0:05:18.080000::Yeah well I like that.
0:05:18.080000 - 0:05:21.280000::I guess French people really are my Greek people
0:05:21.280000 - 0:05:23.280000::in terms of Nate not liking them.
0:05:23.280000 - 0:05:24.280000::Really.
0:05:24.280000 - 0:05:26.080000::You haven't met the right one.
0:05:26.080000 - 0:05:28.080000::You probably only met Parisians.
0:05:28.080000 - 0:05:30.080000::Well God got rid of them.
0:05:30.080000 - 0:05:32.080000::God got rid of the right ones long ago.
0:05:32.080000 - 0:05:34.080000::You haven't met the cheese monger.
0:05:34.080000 - 0:05:36.080000::What do you mean by that?
0:05:36.080000 - 0:05:39.080000::He took them out with diseases because he wanted to chill with them.
0:05:39.080000 - 0:05:43.080000::I'm sure there was amazing French people but God missed them up in the spirit realm.
0:05:43.080000 - 0:05:45.080000::So he took them all back in the bubonic plague
0:05:45.080000 - 0:05:48.080000::and now we are stuck with the fuckers.
0:05:48.080000 - 0:05:50.080000::Because I meet a French person.
0:05:50.080000 - 0:05:52.080000::Good God these people are so rude.
0:05:52.080000 - 0:05:54.080000::I have no sympathy for them.
0:05:54.080000 - 0:06:00.080000::I mean they're probably the easiest government historically to kind of take over.
0:06:00.080000 - 0:06:04.080000::I feel like they've just been like I don't think they've ever held their ground
0:06:04.080000 - 0:06:07.080000::in somebody's like just historically invading.
0:06:07.080000 - 0:06:09.080000::I think it's always been 100% sexy.
0:06:09.080000 - 0:06:10.080000::Maybe not the government.
0:06:10.080000 - 0:06:12.080000::The government conqueror that comes in.
0:06:12.080000 - 0:06:13.080000::They're always right there.
0:06:13.080000 - 0:06:15.080000::Oh let me just stop here right there.
0:06:15.080000 - 0:06:20.080000::Because maybe the government was weak fools that let the Nazis run that country over
0:06:20.080000 - 0:06:22.080000::40s member that war.
0:06:22.080000 - 0:06:25.080000::But there was and then called the French resistance.
0:06:25.080000 - 0:06:26.080000::And that was the baddest.
0:06:26.080000 - 0:06:28.080000::And that is what I played in many video games.
0:06:28.080000 - 0:06:32.080000::Many saboteurs were active within that organization.
0:06:32.080000 - 0:06:33.080000::The French resistance.
0:06:33.080000 - 0:06:36.080000::Look their own people took them over dude.
0:06:36.080000 - 0:06:41.080000::The Roman Empire took their ass over the fucking whatever whatever whatever was going on.
0:06:41.080000 - 0:06:43.080000::They're just folded immediately.
0:06:43.080000 - 0:06:46.080000::But please would you know who you respect to the French resistance?
0:06:46.080000 - 0:06:47.080000::Look where they are.
0:06:48.080000 - 0:06:49.080000::Oh.
0:06:49.080000 - 0:06:52.080000::And see how I brought it back.
0:06:52.080000 - 0:06:54.080000::Because of their military what's going on?
0:06:54.080000 - 0:06:57.080000::Damn Jack put it put him away put him away put him.
0:06:57.080000 - 0:07:03.080000::You're fat fatty deposits in your arm but put those things away.
0:07:03.080000 - 0:07:04.080000::They're muscle deposits.
0:07:04.080000 - 0:07:06.080000::Those muscular deposits in your arm.
0:07:06.080000 - 0:07:07.080000::Put them things away.
0:07:07.080000 - 0:07:16.080000::You know who probably had those were the winches.
0:07:16.080000 - 0:07:18.080000::The winches back in the day.
0:07:18.080000 - 0:07:20.080000::Old Tommy Britain.
0:07:20.080000 - 0:07:21.080000::That's what we're doing.
0:07:21.080000 - 0:07:24.080000::Not just the winches but all that lower class probably.
0:07:24.080000 - 0:07:26.080000::How they all have that too.
0:07:26.080000 - 0:07:32.080000::I met the second person I've ever met in my life who has bumps all over the body last night.
0:07:32.080000 - 0:07:34.080000::Was it a mod sexy model?
0:07:34.080000 - 0:07:41.080000::It was a sexy model for maybe a stand up comedy club magazine.
0:07:42.080000 - 0:07:47.080000::We need to start making a stand up comedy magazine.
0:07:47.080000 - 0:07:49.080000::That would be awesome.
0:07:49.080000 - 0:07:50.080000::That's a great idea.
0:07:50.080000 - 0:07:52.080000::Because you can take a few people's sets.
0:07:52.080000 - 0:07:53.080000::I don't think that exists.
0:07:53.080000 - 0:07:54.080000::Yeah.
0:07:54.080000 - 0:07:57.080000::It's literally a transcription of the sets.
0:07:57.080000 - 0:08:01.080000::Just drop an hour long my hour in an article format.
0:08:01.080000 - 0:08:02.080000::That's nice.
0:08:02.080000 - 0:08:10.080000::Wait but but okay let's get on topic for this episode because this is one we've wanted the listeners have wanted to hear for a minute.
0:08:11.080000 - 0:08:13.080000::We're talking about Britain.
0:08:13.080000 - 0:08:15.080000::Not the royals we've discussed them.
0:08:15.080000 - 0:08:17.080000::We're talking about the common folk.
0:08:17.080000 - 0:08:18.080000::Excuse me sorry.
0:08:18.080000 - 0:08:20.080000::Gavin and Stacy Cor.
0:08:20.080000 - 0:08:23.080000::Okay and I think they might be Welsh.
0:08:23.080000 - 0:08:25.080000::And this is very mean.
0:08:25.080000 - 0:08:27.080000::I think that's basically the same thing.
0:08:27.080000 - 0:08:31.080000::Yeah to you it might because you have bridged blindness.
0:08:31.080000 - 0:08:36.080000::I know all the corners and pockets and short ditch and all the rest.
0:08:36.080000 - 0:08:38.080000::Manchester.
0:08:39.080000 - 0:08:41.080000::Manchester you're not in.
0:08:41.080000 - 0:08:51.080000::I love the difference between like the high class British people are all proper.
0:08:51.080000 - 0:08:52.080000::And they're all right.
0:08:52.080000 - 0:08:53.080000::They were as suits.
0:08:53.080000 - 0:09:01.080000::And then the drop between there's no like there's no spectrum between high class and middle and like the working class.
0:09:01.080000 - 0:09:02.080000::It goes.
0:09:02.080000 - 0:09:03.080000::And then it goes.
0:09:03.080000 - 0:09:06.080000::The working class is just.
0:09:06.080000 - 0:09:09.080000::They're all making corridors for fiat's and whatnot.
0:09:09.080000 - 0:09:11.080000::They're eating a lot of things.
0:09:11.080000 - 0:09:12.080000::They eat in a grove.
0:09:12.080000 - 0:09:14.080000::Some beans and gravy.
0:09:14.080000 - 0:09:17.080000::Give me a piece.
0:09:17.080000 - 0:09:19.080000::Give it a bit.
0:09:19.080000 - 0:09:20.080000::A bit.
0:09:20.080000 - 0:09:21.080000::Yeah.
0:09:21.080000 - 0:09:23.080000::They have local fun royals.
0:09:23.080000 - 0:09:24.080000::Yellow people.
0:09:24.080000 - 0:09:32.080000::Well and the British go back long before you know the British go way back.
0:09:32.080000 - 0:09:33.080000::Pretty much.
0:09:33.080000 - 0:09:34.080000::Yeah.
0:09:34.080000 - 0:09:35.080000::Pretty much.
0:09:35.080000 - 0:09:36.080000::Pretty far back.
0:09:36.080000 - 0:09:40.080000::I will couldn't tell you exactly when truthfully from just being honest.
0:09:40.080000 - 0:09:43.080000::Well, long enough for me to know that they had about it.
0:09:43.080000 - 0:09:46.080000::There's a deep pagan history to that country.
0:09:46.080000 - 0:09:48.080000::Deep pagan history.
0:09:48.080000 - 0:09:53.080000::And that is an anti-Jesus religion which started in ancient Rome.
0:09:53.080000 - 0:09:55.080000::Centered around.
0:09:55.080000 - 0:09:58.080000::Live theater.
0:09:58.080000 - 0:09:59.080000::Sacrifice.
0:09:59.080000 - 0:10:00.080000::Sacrifice.

0:10:00 - 0:10:05.580000::Moak potions potions as well and I'm guessing I don't know that I
0:10:06.420000 - 0:10:11.340000::Mean we just got a drop Roman to this for a second. You know the Romans were all the way up there
0:10:12.060000 - 0:10:16.180000::They had a lot towards the top that we've already talked about. Okay
0:10:17.300000 - 0:10:24.800000::Okay, well what all right, so that's the history of of England really essentially Romans were there before that
0:10:24.800000 - 0:10:30.680000::There are some people let's just do the rough history way back in the day you had the people making those stone
0:10:31.640000 - 0:10:37.920000::Where they call it stonehenge stonehenge stonehenge and we don't know how they to this day
0:10:37.920000 - 0:10:40.640000::They can't figure out how they got them things by the way a pathetic
0:10:41.560000 - 0:10:43.560000::ancient sort of
0:10:43.560000 - 0:10:44.840000::cultural remnant
0:10:44.840000 - 0:10:52.440000::You know like most of the most of the you look at the Mayan they have the whole pyramid the Egyptians have pyramids and then
0:10:53.160000 - 0:10:58.340000::The ancient fucking British people those those what if I told you that was back peasants
0:10:58.340000 - 0:11:01.380000::Yeah, they just put up five stones in a circle
0:11:01.380000 - 0:11:04.480000::That was what you got you were supposed to build a fucking pyramid dude
0:11:04.480000 - 0:11:08.240000::They got the wrong fucking blueprint. I won't stand in an occhi aliens, dude
0:11:08.240000 - 0:11:12.180000::What if I they gave them as a fucking prank? They're like they gave
0:11:15.240000 - 0:11:20.920000::What if I told you the stones that remain were just the foundation of a much larger structure
0:11:21.920000 - 0:11:23.920000::What if I told you that
0:11:26.320000 - 0:11:28.320000::You're laughing now there is
0:11:35.760000 - 0:11:40.360000::Those were Neanderthals dude those were like people who were like 50 50 human
0:11:40.360000 - 0:11:45.440000::Neanderthals and then they kind of fade you know I'm saying right like
0:11:45.440000 - 0:11:51.680000::Well, then they may wait for the loan out the backs of the Neanderthals a little too heavily in the in Britain
0:11:51.680000 - 0:11:56.800000::I think you don't think it was the other way around you don't think it was the other way the Neanderthals were that
0:11:56.800000 - 0:11:58.760000::Imagine the Neanderthals all sexual
0:12:02.480000 - 0:12:04.480000::Right right
0:12:05.280000 - 0:12:07.280000::What do you mean us
0:12:07.920000 - 0:12:11::Well us homo sapiens. I don't have a drop of
0:12:11 - 0:12:12.280000::Brazilian me
0:12:12.400000 - 0:12:17.080000::Yeah, you sure yeah, you fuck we all I know all three of us do I definitely do not
0:12:17.840000 - 0:12:22.680000::Now with a 10 foot pole look at my 23 and me. It's the most unbridged thing you've ever seen in your life
0:12:23.360000 - 0:12:25.920000::I'll send it to you. I'll put it on the patreon. I'm putting on that
0:12:25.920000 - 0:12:30.160000::I've been asking me for that for a while. I haven't sent it so you haven't sent me the Venmo
0:12:31.960000 - 0:12:33.960000::What I'm saying is your records
0:12:34.200000 - 0:12:38.440000::So we're actually looking to respect Britain today and analyze the story and stuff
0:12:38.560000 - 0:12:44.720000::Which is big of us because they of the way that they treated us because if this was 400 years ago
0:12:45.280000 - 0:12:50::300 years ago even yeah, we wouldn't be so nice to them because
0:12:50.400000 - 0:12:54.160000::Of what they tried to do to us in the United States of America
0:12:54.640000 - 0:12:57.960000::Which is taxation without representing our
0:12:59.080000 - 0:13:01.080000::interests
0:13:01.080000 - 0:13:03.080000::Well, can I do you do a
0:13:03.720000 - 0:13:11.480000::Tactics that I've learned in therapy for you joy. Take we practice something here a joy tactic right yeah a joy tactic
0:13:11.560000 - 0:13:16.120000::Why don't we put ourselves in the British's shoes for a second?
0:13:16.400000 - 0:13:18.960000::Go way back to the 1700s
0:13:19.480000 - 0:13:22.160000::Now they're not stinky there. They were just wouldn't whatever
0:13:23.600000 - 0:13:31.360000::Stinky ass go way back to the 1700s you spent all this damn ass money getting this little ass country's set up
0:13:31.640000 - 0:13:38.080000::You sent the mayflower or actually you didn't send that but the pilgrims came over on that shit to escape the horrible church
0:13:39.560000 - 0:13:41.840000::But then you're like oh they got shit over there
0:13:41.840000 - 0:13:45.960000::So then you start sending all your resources you're paying for this shit to be set up right?
0:13:46.880000 - 0:13:49.080000::Then all of a sudden you have these little bratty
0:13:50.440000 - 0:13:52.440000::Americans with new fangled
0:13:52.800000 - 0:13:59.520000::Accents and they're saying now we don't want you anymore appreciate you setting all this shit up for us appreciate all your
0:14:00.080000 - 0:14:05.680000::Infrastructure that you help get going getting this shit off the ground, but actually we're gonna start killing you with muskets
0:14:06.480000 - 0:14:11.680000::Gorilla style different than how you guys know how to play because those soldiers used to just walk in a straight line
0:14:11.680000 - 0:14:14.160000::It wasn't until the Americans came in gorilla style
0:14:14.800000 - 0:14:21.600000::Which they may have learned from the name of Americans and they start get they start breaking the rules of war and we start
0:14:21.600000 - 0:14:28.200000::Plants of the easiest that must have been the easiest like people think like the the generals back then like George Washington
0:14:28.200000 - 0:14:34.120000::Wow these military geniuses are you fucking kidding me you you had they literally were lined up just
0:14:34.680000 - 0:14:36.680000::Needed this time. It's
0:14:36.920000 - 0:14:42.320000::Precisely new we're going to have a battle right here all of my men are going to be lined up in
0:14:42.840000 - 0:14:47.760000::In line and here's our weapons that we have dude. That's the easiest fucking shit. You just hiding a tree
0:14:48.480000 - 0:14:54.080000::Are you in right flanking from the side? Well, I would like the trees on well there. Yeah
0:14:55.080000 - 0:14:57.080000::Right I know
0:14:57.080000 - 0:14:59.980000::Automatically everything because all those fools were just shooting one

0:15:00 - 0:15:03.480000::but I'll bowl it at a time, but I'd get that extra mag in there.
0:15:04.320000 - 0:15:08.220000::Make it put on the automatic little mod on the on the musket.
0:15:09.360000 - 0:15:13.200000::You know, I went bowling and two lanes at once last night.
0:15:14.640000 - 0:15:15.240000::Uh huh.
0:15:15.360000 - 0:15:16.560000::One ball in each hand.
0:15:17.680000 - 0:15:18.560000::Down the lanes.
0:15:19.160000 - 0:15:23.800000::This is this is this is your brain would have done well on the front lines
0:15:23.800000 - 0:15:25.560000::of the American Revolutionary War.
0:15:26.080000 - 0:15:26.840000::The verb don't well.
0:15:26.840000 - 0:15:29.200000::See, the British would never think about breaking the rules like that.
0:15:29.280000 - 0:15:32.840000::The Americans did John Adams did God.
0:15:32.840000 - 0:15:33.360000::They did.
0:15:34.400000 - 0:15:37.800000::So he imagined a lot of your trauma.
0:15:39.600000 - 0:15:40.360000::Yeah, I can imagine.
0:15:42.120000 - 0:15:44.760000::I'd be would you be a do you guys think you would have been
0:15:44.760000 - 0:15:47.920000::letharias back in the calling it call any times?
0:15:48.840000 - 0:15:50.640000::You're talking about people who have been letharia.
0:15:50.640000 - 0:15:53.840000::You're talking about sinners back then.
0:15:53.840000 - 0:15:55.880000::I'm talking more about more about more than sex.
0:15:55.880000 - 0:15:58.480000::I'm talking about swag and charm.
0:15:58.880000 - 0:16:04.040000::And just kind of like, uh, I would have my end part with the beautiful woman
0:16:04.040000 - 0:16:04.640000::of back then.
0:16:06.840000 - 0:16:09.640000::I would just roll around with about 10 goats on my arm.
0:16:10.960000 - 0:16:13::You know, we'd all go in the bar together.
0:16:13 - 0:16:14.920000::I don't go anywhere without my goats.
0:16:15.320000 - 0:16:16.200000::Oh, they can't come in.
0:16:16.440000 - 0:16:21.480000::Jack sir, Jack do not bring these mother fuckers in here every single

0:16:23.920000 - 0:16:26.800000::You think they're just goats, but I swear to God, I can talk to them.
0:16:26.800000 - 0:16:30.840000::And that would be my whole thing back then is my communication with the other
0:16:30.840000 - 0:16:31.360000::realm.
0:16:31.720000 - 0:16:33.560000::I'd bring them into the bar that get fucked up with me.
0:16:33.560000 - 0:16:37.880000::Then I ho all every single one of these goats twisted like crazy socializing,
0:16:38.080000 - 0:16:39.200000::very social goats.
0:16:40.720000 - 0:16:42.760000::And yeah, then I'd probably get killed.
0:16:43.120000 - 0:16:44.080000::I probably get killed pretty.
0:16:44.120000 - 0:16:45.520000::The goats off the mead.
0:16:46.560000 - 0:16:47.080000::Yep.
0:16:47.080000 - 0:16:49.720000::You don't want to see what a goat could sing like because you've seen that
0:16:49.720000 - 0:16:50.240000::goat.
0:16:50.240000 - 0:16:55.680000::Yeah, that would be the goat with a belly button ring.
0:16:56.800000 - 0:17:00.040000::And hello riders.
0:17:00.040000 - 0:17:01.920000::Let's try to bring a goat.
0:17:02.160000 - 0:17:02.920000::Try the trouble.
0:17:02.920000 - 0:17:03.720000::I'm just now.
0:17:04.840000 - 0:17:06.240000::Uh-huh gold cap tooth.

0:17:13.440000 - 0:17:14.440000::Damn, this goat.
0:17:14.440000 - 0:17:16.840000::I feel like we got that new Dreamworks joint.
0:17:17.160000 - 0:17:18::Cook it right now.
0:17:18 - 0:17:19.160000::Swag goats.
0:17:19.480000 - 0:17:20.480000::The sexual goat.
0:17:21.160000 - 0:17:24.480000::Swag goat goat goat goat goat goat high school.
0:17:25.480000 - 0:17:26.480000::Man.

0:17:26.880000 - 0:17:31.320000::So a little off track from the British and having a little more fun talking about the American
0:17:31.320000 - 0:17:33.880000::Revolutionary War, but maybe that's a separate episode.
0:17:34.160000 - 0:17:38.400000::Well, let's say not to bring it right immediately back to the Revolutionary War,
0:17:38.400000 - 0:17:39.160000::but okay.
0:17:39.600000 - 0:17:40.560000::Okay, ask a one.
0:17:40.560000 - 0:17:43.800000::I find it quite disturbing what you've painted earlier.
0:17:44.240000 - 0:17:48.400000::This idea of, oh, I paint for this big trip.
0:17:48.480000 - 0:17:53.240000::And so when you get there, I can disrespect you because and that's okay.
0:17:53.240000 - 0:17:55.680000::And we should feel bad for them and being their shoes.
0:17:56 - 0:18:03.760000::Now let's say that I go, Hey, man, Eric, it's on all expenses paid trip to an island off of Costa Rica.
0:18:03.760000 - 0:18:07.800000::Where no human being lives going out there, man, it's all on my dime.
0:18:08.160000 - 0:18:09.120000::It's going to be great.
0:18:09.320000 - 0:18:15.960000::But then next thing you know, you go out and you flip a bunch of burgers and I go, you can't actually eat that shit.
0:18:16.760000 - 0:18:21.040000::Uh, I like what you're doing there, but those burgers are from me and my friends now.
0:18:21.440000 - 0:18:29.680000::See now that I put it in terms of burgers and islands, you're seeing how how the ethics of the revolution.
0:18:29.680000 - 0:18:30.400000::Understand.
0:18:30.400000 - 0:18:31.040000::You see what I'm saying?
0:18:32.040000 - 0:18:33.920000::This is what this is what's interesting.
0:18:33.920000 - 0:18:40.480000::This is the power of empathetic cold reasoning, hypothesization.
0:18:40.680000 - 0:18:41.560000::You know what I'm saying?
0:18:41.560000 - 0:18:44.040000::So for a second, we stepped into the British.
0:18:44.040000 - 0:18:45.480000::We saw how they felt.
0:18:46.160000 - 0:18:50.200000::Now we step back into the American shoes with greater perspective.
0:18:50.280000 - 0:18:55.640000::And actually now I'm even more on the side of the damn Americans because of the techniques that we've just used
0:18:55.640000 - 0:18:56.480000::conversationally.
0:18:56.680000 - 0:18:57.040000::Okay.
0:18:58 - 0:19:03.240000::So it's very big of us what I'm saying to forgive them and to still honor them.
0:19:04.040000 - 0:19:04.920000::And I think it's healthy.
0:19:04.920000 - 0:19:07.320000::That's what we should have independent standards.
0:19:07.320000 - 0:19:08.600000::Live fourth, of course, we should.
0:19:08.600000 - 0:19:09.160000::I love that.
0:19:09.160000 - 0:19:10.160000::It's the best day of the year.
0:19:10.840000 - 0:19:16.040000::If you anybody wants to buy mushroom chocolates, go to my website, but there should be a reverse.
0:19:16.040000 - 0:19:16.440000::Delight.
0:19:16.440000 - 0:19:16.760000::Wait.
0:19:17.600000 - 0:19:23.040000::Do you have a promo code that's about to drop on the phone or is just one of it because that would be so awesome.
0:19:23.040000 - 0:19:23.920000::Just switch it.
0:19:23.920000 - 0:19:24.680000::Go to Jack.
0:19:24.680000 - 0:19:25.360000::What?
0:19:25.360000 - 0:19:28.560000::Second, like, Ben Singer dot com promo code.
0:19:28.560000 - 0:19:30.360000::You're just mashing them and switching a car.
0:19:30.360000 - 0:19:30.880000::Switch it.
0:19:30.880000 - 0:19:32.680000::They're not even they can.
0:19:32.680000 - 0:19:36.520000::It's a mushroom just in the microwave with some Nestle crunch.
0:19:38.920000 - 0:19:40.640000::In case it is with whatever.
0:19:40.640000 - 0:19:44::But what I'm saying is we need the opposite of the fourth of July where we go.
0:19:44 - 0:19:44.680000::You know what?
0:19:44.680000 - 0:19:45.760000::Bygones day.
0:19:45.760000 - 0:19:47.760000::It's called bygones day.
0:19:47.760000 - 0:19:48.760000::That sounds good.
0:19:48.760000 - 0:19:54.200000::Where it's maybe July 8th, the opposite of July 4th.
0:19:54.200000 - 0:19:59.440000::And we, you know, we thought we, I don't know, we celebrate the British and we go.

0:20:00 - 0:20:02::We're bigger than this now
0:20:02.040000 - 0:20:07.480000::We're over it you guys are the last island and we are a giant fucking place where Tony Hawk is from
0:20:07.920000 - 0:20:09.880000::Okay, so we're not petty well
0:20:10.640000 - 0:20:14.240000::Dude it's just so interesting to look at all this because
0:20:14.760000 - 0:20:20.600000::For what you see the war of 1812 there was even there was conflict for a minute with the Brits
0:20:20.600000 - 0:20:26.960000::And then probably the 1800s we still resented them and they were pissed because they lost that chunk of their empire
0:20:27.120000 - 0:20:32.840000::But they were doing pretty good in the 1800s. You see what I'm saying. It's not until World War one
0:20:33.760000 - 0:20:35.760000::That thing really started changing
0:20:37.440000 - 0:20:43.680000::Well, yes, I'm somewhere on there and then World War two happens. They're devastated by the Blitzkriegs
0:20:44.600000 - 0:20:48.560000::And their empire is shrinking despite Churchill's best efforts
0:20:49.520000 - 0:20:54.080000::Then after World War two our military industrial complex starts heating the fuck up
0:20:54.640000 - 0:20:56.640000::Korean War the Korean War
0:20:57.040000 - 0:21:04.520000::And then I would say by then the student had become the master you see what I'm saying quite a curious relationship
0:21:04.960000 - 0:21:06.960000::dynamic between our two countries right
0:21:07.760000 - 0:21:10::Do you think it's a problem I was getting a
0:21:10.920000 - 0:21:18.680000::I was in an Uber for about 45 minutes and what the way you were just talking reminded me of this Uber driver Eric where they were giving me a lecture for about
0:21:18.960000 - 0:21:23.440000::45 minutes about how America came to be at 3 30 in the morning
0:21:23.920000 - 0:21:25.920000::And
0:21:25.920000 - 0:21:27.920000::You were telling me about this
0:21:28.360000 - 0:21:29.880000::Yeah
0:21:29.880000 - 0:21:35.520000::And they were like you know, it's really crazy the way that it was just this total scramble between France, Spain and
0:21:36.360000 - 0:21:38.360000::the islands of
0:21:38.360000 - 0:21:39.880000::the UK
0:21:39.880000 - 0:21:43.440000::And so it makes me think damn can you imagine if we were all Spanish?
0:21:44.680000 - 0:21:51.160000::Wow, I mean out you know that my mom's maiden name is Boca Negra. That's right. Yep
0:21:51.640000 - 0:21:59.120000::That they should they should have a class in K through 12 where for one of your periods in class you just
0:21:59.640000 - 0:22:07.600000::On the dime on the public dime you just get to be in an Uber and just drive around for an hour and then your Uber teacher
0:22:08.080000 - 0:22:14.640000::Is your Uber is the the teacher? Okay, and then you get to talk to you about you know crypto currency
0:22:17.240000 - 0:22:19.720000::You know ancient rip home economic
0:22:19.720000 - 0:22:26.160000::Conspiracy theories yeah, they get to do whatever and you get to learn from the salt of the earth and
0:22:26.440000 - 0:22:30.400000::They're gonna teach you things that you would never learn in school
0:22:31.960000 - 0:22:37.800000::Can I ask something about salt? We guys think we should start a fleet of free of driver driver educators
0:22:38.120000 - 0:22:40.880000::Fleet Fox yeah, yeah, he boxes
0:22:41.840000 - 0:22:47.520000::What are you gonna say Jack? I was gonna ask about salt because when people say salt on earth
0:22:47.880000 - 0:22:49.880000::Thanks. Yeah
0:22:50.760000 - 0:22:55::There's not salt from anywhere else am I wrong?
0:22:57.080000 - 0:23:02.880000::There's probably you actually just answer your question man. How did I answer my question?
0:23:03.440000 - 0:23:06.760000::How did I I you sure because I don't
0:23:08.360000 - 0:23:10.360000::What
0:23:12.160000 - 0:23:14.160000::There's not
0:23:17.520000 - 0:23:21.960000::I don't what are you I do think one of the three of us will die on this podcast
0:23:24 - 0:23:26::Two hundred questions
0:23:27.200000 - 0:23:33.040000::Two neurons are gonna collide in the frontal cortex of our brain and it's gonna actually explode the explode our brain out the front
0:23:34.080000 - 0:23:40.880000::Well, that's how much joy were we're that that's the risk that we signed up for and we fully know that
0:23:42.040000 - 0:23:45.560000::You know I had a mum risking our lives every day
0:23:45.680000 - 0:23:50.360000::Did you see me fidgeting during the movie Nate yesterday? There's a moment where I thought I'd
0:23:50.360000 - 0:23:53::Yeah, the whole how could I not the whole theater fucking new?
0:23:55.200000 - 0:24:00.240000::I thought you're passing my face is going now. So I was doing stress during the movie where you smile
0:24:02.680000 - 0:24:06.200000::I do the about six thousand letteral function by a lateral function and
0:24:06.840000 - 0:24:14.080000::I was good to go but there was a minute but I think it's because I had that large diet coke it was making me get all tweaked out
0:24:16.080000 - 0:24:18.080000::um no

0:25:00 - 0:25:03.880000::60% of what goes on your skin is the eye list is the bloodstream
0:25:05.080000 - 0:25:13.760000::I'm under the eye list. Oh, I'm under the eyelids in the eyes. That's why I do my flonies. I can feel that now. Yeah, you do flones in your eyes
0:25:14.560000 - 0:25:17.960000::Yeah, it makes it that shit go away immediately scratchy throat
0:25:22.200000 - 0:25:25.680000::So what's you guys's favorite part about London town?
0:25:26.680000 - 0:25:33.780000::Have I been you know what's weird is I've never been I have never been to
0:25:33.780000 - 0:25:43.440000::Say that again ever I know I know I know you're right. I know I didn't fucking know I wouldn't suggest a bend if I knew you guys
0:25:43.440000 - 0:25:47.680000::So I am I can only imagine what it would be like from
0:25:48.280000 - 0:25:55.560000::The novels that I've read from the TV shows. I have a romanticized version of well great
0:25:55.680000 - 0:26:04.140000::And is like but you know what is is shattering that veil is the tick tocks that I see of the British people when they're in their
0:26:04.400000 - 0:26:10.720000::Apartments and they're eating fucked up meals and they have really bad sense of like makeup, you know
0:26:11.080000 - 0:26:16.440000::Wow, they're not wearing makeup so many insults they were the cheapest makeup now, bro
0:26:17.760000 - 0:26:25.280000::It's just the British people they must have the most busted Sephora in I don't know if there's one in London or it's like hard to get to but they
0:26:25.720000 - 0:26:32.460000::Man they just aren't they need they need some more tutorials man. They need a mall. There should be a lot of Americans
0:26:35.280000 - 0:26:40.440000::They just need a mall they need to outlet mall. Oh, trust me. They have malls. We're put an American army
0:26:40.440000 - 0:26:42.840000::But we don't have a fucking base in the UK. Do we?
0:26:45.320000 - 0:26:47.320000::That they know of
0:26:47.320000 - 0:26:49.320000::They know just say
0:26:50.560000 - 0:26:55.360000::Look at Wembley stadium attention to the people who are selling the concessions there
0:26:55.680000 - 0:26:59.160000::You will notice that they are ranking officers within the United States military
0:27:00 - 0:27:04.280000::So next time you try and buy some beans and toast at the soccer game just now, right?
0:27:04.520000 - 0:27:10.760000::The red dots on the back of the lot. This is what I want to say in their pocket. Uh-huh look for the glass of the great Britain has
0:27:11.680000 - 0:27:18.320000::They have a fucking nutrition problem and I feel like great as good. It's a lot of the flak with oh, we're eating
0:27:18.720000 - 0:27:20.720000::Kentucky fried chicken for
0:27:21.760000 - 0:27:25.480000::Breakfast we're eating so poorly everybody here so fucking fat
0:27:26.080000 - 0:27:30.160000::All right the great British I feel like they started that that
0:27:31.240000 - 0:27:39.680000::That trope of Americans being like because I feel like they have the most busted nutrition of any of any country on the planet
0:27:39.680000 - 0:27:45.840000::You see what they're eating you see what they're they're their plates that they're consuming beans and I think
0:27:48.360000 - 0:27:54.800000::Pregidus is fucking showing dude and I didn't think I'd have to deal with you like this and confront you on this podcast
0:27:55.800000 - 0:28:03.360000::Your idea of great Britain as it stands is maybe maybe would have been correct in 1965 out in you know, I'm saying
0:28:04.200000 - 0:28:11.760000::Manchester style sub suburbs of Manchester, but they have salads now they eat avocados. They dress amazingly

0:28:13.960000 - 0:28:15.960000::You think they have avocados in the UK?
0:28:16.560000 - 0:28:22.800000::Yeah, they definitely do I've seen have you seen one personally or do you think someone's just trying to get in bed with you again, dude?
0:28:23.080000 - 0:28:25.080000::Because a lot of these

0:29:27.340000 - 0:29:32.700000::But I think it might be helpful if we go around and say one thing that we really love about Britain and it can't be a
0:29:33.220000 - 0:29:34.980000::Little funny
0:29:34.980000 - 0:29:40.340000::Joke about how they actually suck like you gotta say something that you legit like about their asses

0:31:47.320000 - 0:31:52.680000::Python behavior that shit was very silly
0:31:53.200000 - 0:31:54.400000::No
0:31:54.400000 - 0:32:00.440000::No, yeah, they invented random random didn't exist before them right they meant to close cold
0:32:01.560000 - 0:32:08.800000::Monty Python was random so that club random could walk and run and what do you think that that gave way for what do you think that paved the way for watch this?
0:32:08.800000 - 0:32:10.800000::I'm out
0:32:14 - 0:32:18.800000::Holding the lot and was watching the ministry of silly walks in the course you are you kidding me?
0:32:18.800000 - 0:32:23.960000::No question they were doing the ministry of silly you know silly push-ups getting ready for that right
0:32:24.360000 - 0:32:28.240000::Getting ready for anything what their crimes were their cheristic crimes
0:32:29 - 0:32:31::But they had families Wow
0:32:31.480000 - 0:32:35.960000::So the comedy is popping what it makes now now now now let's have a serious discussion
0:32:36.520000 - 0:32:42.160000::Because I could hear a British person say something and then here an American person say it yeah
0:32:42.160000 - 0:32:44.160000::I'm gonna be laughing at the British person a little more
0:32:44.920000 - 0:32:51.720000::And it's not just because the accent is novel to me. Okay, trust me. There's some very unfunny British comedians. I won't name on here
0:32:52.520000 - 0:33:00.480000::But so you think is about them that let's there's a scientific reason as to why they are you talking about as far as the
0:33:01.200000 - 0:33:06.160000::Soundway like chakras in a chakras sense like the sound waves in the way that
0:33:06.960000 - 0:33:12.560000::Air and molecules are coming out of their mouth through different vowels that these are softer more loving vowels
0:33:12.560000 - 0:33:16.320000::Is that what you're getting at or you're getting at well? Let me break it down
0:33:16.320000 - 0:33:20.960000::Can I tell you my theory as to why they are a little bit quite hilarious?
0:33:20.960000 - 0:33:24.480000::Well, yeah, we have sort of an inherited
0:33:25.080000 - 0:33:29.560000::Not trauma what are they called generational trauma? It's not that but it is a generation
0:33:29.560000 - 0:33:31.560000::epigenetic
0:33:32.440000 - 0:33:34.440000::epigenetics
0:33:34.440000 - 0:33:40.120000::Yes, I mean like that about the British because we despise we despise them in the past for being
0:33:41.160000 - 0:33:43.400000::T-drinking crown wearing
0:33:44.920000 - 0:33:46.920000::Basically dictators over our
0:33:47.760000 - 0:33:50.480000::Dominion murderous right red cobaltors and
0:33:51.400000 - 0:33:54.600000::Over time their status in the world has a little bit
0:33:55.240000 - 0:33:59.720000::Tick down a little bit hasn't it but that's what he art says still says the same
0:33:59.880000 - 0:34:03.880000::So the posh accent mixed with the a little bit lowered status
0:34:04.760000 - 0:34:06.760000::That's you're talking about humor
0:34:07.400000 - 0:34:12.760000::You're talking about that's you're scientific humor. Yeah, we're talking about the flawed hero
0:34:13.800000 - 0:34:15.800000::You're talking about a hot status
0:34:16.040000 - 0:34:19.240000::Ignoramus you're talking about anchor man you're talking about
0:34:19.800000 - 0:34:22.520000::Right will I think that some of that that
0:34:22.760000 - 0:34:24.600000::You're talking about well
0:34:24.600000 - 0:34:31.720000::That's why I'm fucking wrapping up the Chinese government so hard because as they rise in the sort of world dominance
0:34:32.360000 - 0:34:36.640000::We might be in the American Empire might be in decline. So we get funny
0:34:37.240000 - 0:34:41.880000::That's why we're getting funny you can sense that you're by your name by date we're getting a little more
0:34:42.360000 - 0:34:50.080000::American accent is getting a little bit funnier and it's getting a little funnier is all of us doing what we do because it's so funny that we're so
0:34:50.320000 - 0:34:52.320000::Right and Chinese
0:34:55.440000 - 0:34:57.440000::Well, right, excuse me sorry
0:34:57.440000 - 0:34:59.920000::Jack didn't you show me the guy that like jumps on the

0:35:00 - 0:35:06.800000::D screens in China and he does like an American accent. That's right. He's like, hello, what's up homies? I'm Tony
0:35:07.400000 - 0:35:13.740000::You guys want to buy some of my cool LED signs homie two and a half centimeters homie plexiglass
0:35:14 - 0:35:17.640000::Absolutely great for your business. Oh good. That's pretty funny
0:35:17.640000 - 0:35:23.580000::But that cash from Taiwan if I'm not mistaken that's that goes from Taiwan to watch it back right and I would never
0:35:24.360000 - 0:35:27.600000::Right top time on forever. I'll just say that right now
0:35:28.600000 - 0:35:33.560000::Yeah, I got a Taiwan tattoo on my back this weekend top to bottom
0:35:34.680000 - 0:35:42.680000::Just the shape of the Taiwan is sick. We should go to Taiwan. Are you kidding my ass? I'd love to I would love to go on a road trip a motorcycle
0:35:42.680000 - 0:35:46.380000::Around the coast of Taiwan that would be
0:35:47.080000 - 0:35:49.480000::Because I'm Taiwan kind of small
0:35:52.520000 - 0:35:55.320000::Yeah, it is almost as pretty small

0:40:48.560000 - 0:40:52::They thought he was the perfect human being.
0:40:52 - 0:40:54.280000::But I like making people think that they're scared,
0:40:54.280000 - 0:40:58.440000::and then surprising them, because it makes the surprise even
0:40:58.440000 - 0:41:00.240000::better.

0:42:08.720000 - 0:42:10.240000::I skip what you're saying now.
0:42:10.240000 - 0:42:14.680000::I fully take accountability for what I said, how I've treated
0:42:14.680000 - 0:42:16.720000::them, how I've talked about them.
0:42:16.720000 - 0:42:19::They are not one.
0:42:19 - 0:42:21.560000::There's not a monolith, OK?
0:42:21.560000 - 0:42:23.120000::No, different ways.
0:42:23.120000 - 0:42:25.160000::Variations of British people.
0:42:25.160000 - 0:42:28.720000::There are different people who do have nice makeup, who
0:42:28.720000 - 0:42:31.200000::do eat healthily in there.
0:42:31.200000 - 0:42:33.160000::And I have changed my ways.
0:42:33.160000 - 0:42:36.280000::And I'm never going to talk shit about them ever again.
0:42:36.280000 - 0:42:38.840000::And I really would like to visit and see their culture
0:42:38.840000 - 0:42:43.320000::for myself and get to experience their lush and vibrant
0:42:43.320000 - 0:42:45.240000::sort of way of living.
0:42:45.240000 - 0:42:47.520000::So thank you for checking me like that.
0:42:47.520000 - 0:42:50.200000::Psych ugly ass motherfucker.
0:42:50.200000 - 0:42:51.200000::Psych.
0:42:51.200000 - 0:42:53.120000::Ah, fucking bitch.
0:42:53.120000 - 0:42:55.880000::No, don't take that back because what if I told you
0:42:55.880000 - 0:43:00.920000::because of that I'm taking you on a cruise from LA to London?
0:43:00.920000 - 0:43:02.440000::No way we're going.
0:43:02.440000 - 0:43:04.120000::How it takes so long?
0:43:04.120000 - 0:43:05.840000::We're going through the arch.
0:43:05.840000 - 0:43:07.880000::We're going through the arch here.
0:43:07.880000 - 0:43:10.680000::It's got one of those glacier choppers on the front,
0:43:10.680000 - 0:43:11.960000::breaking through all the ice.
0:43:11.960000 - 0:43:15.040000::And it's going to be about six months, but we'll get there.
0:43:15.040000 - 0:43:15.880000::And we get there.
0:43:15.880000 - 0:43:18.320000::We have four days to spell.
0:43:18.320000 - 0:43:20.120000::This will be my last trip.
0:43:20.120000 - 0:43:21.280000::This will be the end.
0:43:21.280000 - 0:43:25.880000::I'll pass away when I see Big Benjamin.
0:43:25.880000 - 0:43:26.960000::Big Benjamin.
0:43:26.960000 - 0:43:27.480000::Oh, man.
0:43:27.480000 - 0:43:29.480000::A guy named Ben.
0:43:29.480000 - 0:43:30.920000::Do you know that's the big Ben song?
0:43:36.920000 - 0:43:40.160000::Oh, that, the CNN, CNN, MSNBC.
0:43:40.160000 - 0:43:41.480000::Good morning.
0:43:41.480000 - 0:43:42.360000::No, that's down.
0:43:42.360000 - 0:43:46.520000::No, no, no, there's a lot of different songs.
0:43:46.520000 - 0:43:49.040000::There's different songs.
0:43:49.320000 - 0:43:50.320000::Remake it.
0:43:50.320000 - 0:43:53.200000::It went big Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben,
0:43:53.200000 - 0:43:55.200000::No, no, no, no, no, no.
0:43:55.200000 - 0:43:56.040000::Yeah, yeah.
0:43:56.040000 - 0:43:58.920000::Oh, a fish make anyways.
0:43:58.920000 - 0:44:00.440000::Unzip that shit.
0:44:00.440000 - 0:44:01.240000::Let me see.
0:44:01.240000 - 0:44:01.760000::What?
0:44:01.760000 - 0:44:03.880000::Big Benjamin.
0:44:03.880000 - 0:44:07.320000::You're saying that to one of those guards that don't talk.
0:44:07.320000 - 0:44:11.120000::The silent guards like you're a centimeter away.
0:44:11.120000 - 0:44:13.160000::You start cracking the smile immediately.
0:44:13.160000 - 0:44:13.880000::He gets fired.
0:44:13.880000 - 0:44:15.360000::We start dating.
0:44:15.360000 - 0:44:16.560000::He gets rock hard.
0:44:16.560000 - 0:44:17.360000::Can they get hard?
0:44:17.360000 - 0:44:19.360000::Does it get?
0:44:19.360000 - 0:44:20.360000::Who?
0:44:20.360000 - 0:44:21.360000::Does getting a rocker?
0:44:21.360000 - 0:44:23.760000::Does that count for the guards moving?
0:44:26.840000 - 0:44:29.320000::It's undetermined at this point.
0:44:29.320000 - 0:44:30.240000::I'll go find out.
0:44:30.240000 - 0:44:32.720000::I'm going to put on some genuine and just start getting
0:44:32.720000 - 0:44:34.520000::oiled up next time.
0:44:34.520000 - 0:44:36.360000::Down, right on them.
0:44:36.360000 - 0:44:38.040000::I'll make it oiled up.
0:44:38.040000 - 0:44:39.040000::Down.
0:44:39.040000 - 0:44:40.040000::Wow.
0:44:40.040000 - 0:44:41.040000::Let's see.
0:44:41.040000 - 0:44:42.880000::Let's see you be expressionless.
0:44:42.880000 - 0:44:46.680000::When I got fucking KY Jelly head to toe, fully fucking.
0:44:46.680000 - 0:44:47.680000::Yeah, that's right.
0:44:47.680000 - 0:44:49.200000::You slip on the concrete.
0:44:49.200000 - 0:44:51.720000::Scrape your knee really bad, but keep going.
0:44:51.720000 - 0:44:54.160000::Scrape your fucking shit up real bad,
0:44:54.160000 - 0:44:55.360000::but keep trying to torque it.
0:44:55.360000 - 0:44:56.600000::But it's clearly in pain.

0:45:00 - 0:45:04.200000::And then the bona and then they get fired and then you take their job.
0:45:04.800000 - 0:45:10.040000::This is where you will look at all the grime that are just.
0:45:11.680000 - 0:45:13::Oh, grime.
0:45:13 - 0:45:13.840000::What about a rock?
0:45:15.240000 - 0:45:17::Grime rap storm Z.
0:45:17.440000 - 0:45:18.120000::Storm Z.
0:45:19.160000 - 0:45:21::You never seen me eat peanuts like this.
0:45:24.920000 - 0:45:25.720000::Yeah, that's pretty.
0:45:25.720000 - 0:45:26.760000::That's kind of their flow.
0:45:26.760000 - 0:45:28.280000::You kind of got their flow pretty quick.
0:45:28.280000 - 0:45:28.840000::There didn't you?
0:45:29.360000 - 0:45:30.880000::Yeah, peanuts like this.
0:45:31.120000 - 0:45:32.640000::I like jumping off the trees like this.
0:45:34.640000 - 0:45:35.280000::Eat peanuts.
0:45:35.280000 - 0:45:36.440000::I don't even like this.
0:45:36.680000 - 0:45:38.840000::They just say they don't have to because it doesn't.
0:45:38.840000 - 0:45:40.280000::They bomb bounce a lot.
0:45:40.280000 - 0:45:41.680000::It's just it's so melodic.
0:45:41.720000 - 0:45:43.040000::There's such a bouncy culture.
0:45:46.840000 - 0:45:48.920000::Well, how are we not talked about the Beatles?
0:45:49.480000 - 0:45:50.880000::Oh, the music.
0:45:50.880000 - 0:45:52.600000::Yeah, the music, bruh.
0:45:52.600000 - 0:45:54.760000::Oh, they have a lot of the news.
0:45:55.760000 - 0:45:56.520000::The monkey.
0:45:56.520000 - 0:45:57.520000::The old head.
0:45:57.920000 - 0:45:58.920000::Muse.
0:45:58.920000 - 0:46:00.120000::The monkeys are American, maybe.
0:46:00.600000 - 0:46:01.920000::Led Zeppelin.
0:46:02.160000 - 0:46:02.960000::Led Zeppelin.
0:46:04.520000 - 0:46:07.840000::Is it weird that I think of any every single one of these bands as American?
0:46:08.160000 - 0:46:10.680000::Like to me, the Beatles are from like Michigan.
0:46:11.200000 - 0:46:11.960000::You know what I'm saying?
0:46:12.320000 - 0:46:13.760000::They're very much not, man.
0:46:14 - 0:46:15::They are not.
0:46:15 - 0:46:16.360000::Abbie Road and Bopool.
0:46:16.360000 - 0:46:19.480000::And by that, but that could have been on a high school trip.
0:46:20.880000 - 0:46:22.240000::To me, just in my head.
0:46:23.240000 - 0:46:26.240000::Who else is a British kind of rocker?
0:46:27.240000 - 0:46:29.240000::The Cooke's.
0:46:29.240000 - 0:46:30.240000::The Cooke's.
0:46:30.240000 - 0:46:31.240000::Reese with his.
0:46:31.240000 - 0:46:32.240000::Fransford.
0:46:32.240000 - 0:46:33.240000::Harry.
0:46:33.240000 - 0:46:34.240000::Harry.
0:46:34.240000 - 0:46:35.240000::Oh, Frans.
0:46:35.240000 - 0:46:36.240000::Harry.
0:46:36.240000 - 0:46:37.240000::Harry.
0:46:37.240000 - 0:46:38.240000::Fransford and.
0:46:38.240000 - 0:46:39.240000::Rod.
0:46:39.240000 - 0:46:40.240000::Harry.
0:46:40.240000 - 0:46:41.240000::And so how do they do it?
0:46:41.240000 - 0:46:47.240000::Because it's a quite a small island and yet the magnitude of talent and merit is so high.
0:46:47.240000 - 0:46:48.240000::It's not well.
0:46:48.240000 - 0:46:49.240000::No, it's just pure.
0:46:49.240000 - 0:46:50.240000::No, it's not well.
0:46:50.240000 - 0:46:51.240000::It's not well.
0:46:51.240000 - 0:46:52.240000::It couldn't be well.
0:46:52.240000 - 0:46:53.240000::No, it couldn't.
0:46:53.240000 - 0:46:54.240000::No, it's not.
0:46:54.240000 - 0:46:55.240000::It's talent.
0:46:55.240000 - 0:46:56.240000::It's talent.
0:46:56.240000 - 0:46:57.240000::You believe in quite evil.
0:46:57.240000 - 0:46:58.240000::Check that.
0:46:58.240000 - 0:46:59.240000::Check that reduction.
0:46:59.240000 - 0:47:00.240000::Check that.
0:47:00.240000 - 0:47:01.240000::Check that.
0:47:01.240000 - 0:47:02.240000::Check that.
0:47:02.240000 - 0:47:03.240000::Check that.
0:47:03.240000 - 0:47:04.240000::Check that.
0:47:04.240000 - 0:47:05.240000::Check that.
0:47:05.240000 - 0:47:06.240000::Check that.
0:47:06.240000 - 0:47:07.240000::Check that.
0:47:07.240000 - 0:47:08.240000::British people are perfect.
0:47:08.240000 - 0:47:09.240000::I learned epic genetics yesterday.
0:47:09.240000 - 0:47:10.240000::That's just true.
0:47:10.240000 - 0:47:11.240000::I wonder why he also has.
0:47:11.240000 - 0:47:12.240000::He brought that up a couple times.
0:47:12.240000 - 0:47:13.240000::Delicious Indian food.
0:47:13.240000 - 0:47:14.240000::At least London town does.
0:47:14.240000 - 0:47:15.240000::Delicious.
0:47:15.240000 - 0:47:16.240000::And you.
0:47:16.240000 - 0:47:17.240000::All right.
0:47:17.240000 - 0:47:18.240000::I asked you guys this before.
0:47:18.240000 - 0:47:19.240000::You have to pick either Indian food.
0:47:19.240000 - 0:47:20.240000::Mexican food.
0:47:20.240000 - 0:47:22.240000::I will just pick one.
0:47:22.240000 - 0:47:23.240000::I will pick one.
0:47:23.240000 - 0:47:24.240000::I will pick one.
0:47:24.240000 - 0:47:25.240000::I will pick one.
0:47:25.240000 - 0:47:26.240000::I will pick one.
0:47:26.240000 - 0:47:27.240000::I will pick one.
0:47:27.240000 - 0:47:28.240000::One of those.
0:47:28.240000 - 0:47:29.240000::Okay.
0:47:29.240000 - 0:47:30.240000::That's the only kind of food you can have
0:47:30.240000 - 0:47:31.240000::for the rest of your life.
0:47:31.240000 - 0:47:32.240000::Three, two, one.
0:47:32.240000 - 0:47:33.240000::Indian food.
0:47:33.240000 - 0:47:34.240000::Indian food.
0:47:34.240000 - 0:47:35.240000::Wow.
0:47:35.240000 - 0:47:36.240000::Across the board.
0:47:36.240000 - 0:47:38.240000::Indian food.
0:47:38.240000 - 0:47:39.240000::Yes.
0:47:39.240000 - 0:47:40.240000::And it's you would be surprised to hear me say that
0:47:40.240000 - 0:47:41.240000::because I love Mexican food more than ever.
0:47:41.240000 - 0:47:42.240000::I know.
0:47:42.240000 - 0:47:43.240000::I know.
0:47:43.240000 - 0:47:44.240000::I know.
0:47:44.240000 - 0:47:45.240000::I know.
0:47:45.240000 - 0:47:46.240000::I know.

0:47:47.240000 - 0:47:48.240000::That's true.
0:47:48.240000 - 0:47:55.020000::down to one dish man. If you really had to. Wow. I mean, to save the lives of
0:47:55.020000 - 0:47:59.560000::people who you know and love and who you want to get with. Everybody's on a
0:47:59.560000 - 0:48:03.960000::giant railroad and there's a guy train coming down his face. One single dish.
0:48:03.960000 - 0:48:07.040000::One single last dish. Is it same?
0:48:07.040000 - 0:48:12.180000::Yeah, man. Spice. I mean, that's a wide choice. A bit extremely spicy.
0:48:12.180000 - 0:48:19.060000::That cheese cube. Oh, shit with that spinach. Oh, give it to me. I like the
0:48:19.060000 - 0:48:27.080000::alugobi as well. And we can't forget the general so's of them of their
