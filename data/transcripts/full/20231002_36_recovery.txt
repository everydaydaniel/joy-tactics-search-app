0:00:53.480000 - 0:00:54.480000::COVID-19.

0:00:56.480000 - 0:01:00.120000::China deserves all the information that they've gotten from all this.
0:01:00.120000 - 0:01:01.760000::Like go take it.
0:01:01.760000 - 0:01:07.080000::You know, this is your fucking, you earned this, you know?
0:01:07.080000 - 0:01:10.520000::They wouldn't, China wouldn't know what to do with my asset that could fucking get it all
0:01:10.520000 - 0:01:12.320000::on the one package.
0:01:12.320000 - 0:01:15.680000::I'm too much for China for any of these tech companies, any of these people who have made
0:01:15.680000 - 0:01:16.680000::in my privacy.
0:01:16.680000 - 0:01:17.920000::Good luck, China, fucking package me up.
0:01:17.920000 - 0:01:18.920000::Take a bottom mind.
0:01:18.920000 - 0:01:21.720000::They have a whole department dedicated to your fucking ass, the air right now.
0:01:21.720000 - 0:01:22.720000::They got a decision.
0:01:22.720000 - 0:01:23.720000::Just to study.
0:01:23.720000 - 0:01:26.320000::How does his mind work?
0:01:26.320000 - 0:01:28.880000::How is he so dark and twisted yet so?
0:01:28.880000 - 0:01:36.800000::How is he so gentle yet kind of like fucking threatening, sexy, yet approachable yet fucking
0:01:36.800000 - 0:01:40.800000::about to be rich?
0:01:40.800000 - 0:01:41.800000::What's his background?
0:01:41.800000 - 0:01:43.280000::Yeah, what's his background?
0:01:43.280000 - 0:01:47.440000::No question about any back taxes that he has to, nothing has not come from.
0:01:47.440000 - 0:01:53.040000::How is that so bad at using light too?
0:01:53.040000 - 0:01:54.040000::I'm trying to hook it up.
0:01:54.040000 - 0:01:56.040000::I'm trying to like sources.
0:01:56.040000 - 0:02:00.560000::There we go, a little bit lighter so people can see his face.
0:02:00.560000 - 0:02:01.560000::It is interesting.
0:02:01.560000 - 0:02:07.720000::You are a bit of a Dracula because you have these powers, but you are weak to certain things.
0:02:07.720000 - 0:02:12.200000::Certain things that other people would never think of even that being a possibility of
0:02:12.200000 - 0:02:14.600000::something to be weak to.
0:02:14.600000 - 0:02:15.600000::The Sunset.
0:02:15.600000 - 0:02:17.880000::Yeah, maybe people don't know this, but I am afraid of this.
0:02:17.880000 - 0:02:22.240000::I used to be afraid of this sunset before I got my anxiety fucking dialed in, dialed
0:02:22.240000 - 0:02:26.200000::down, afraid of the sunset.
0:02:26.200000 - 0:02:28::Yes.
0:02:28 - 0:02:34.600000::Anytime this, when my anxiety was going crazy a couple years ago, I would, and I'm walking
0:02:34.600000 - 0:02:37.840000::the dog and walking outside and Jack has seen this happen in real time.
0:02:37.840000 - 0:02:38.840000::It felt like we're old.
0:02:38.840000 - 0:02:42.840000::It's like the mood, full moon comes out and it's like, oh, fuck, it's happening.
0:02:42.840000 - 0:02:43.840000::My God.
0:02:43.840000 - 0:02:48.520000::I just literally like, I couldn't process reality in the same way when the Sun was
0:02:48.520000 - 0:02:49.520000::sitting.
0:02:49.520000 - 0:02:53::It's like the light just like changed everything.
0:02:53 - 0:02:57.120000::I just feel like I couldn't process reality when it was happening and it, this associated
0:02:57.120000 - 0:02:58.440000::me essentially.
0:02:58.440000 - 0:03:03.640000::Every time the Sunset, dude, and it was driving me mad and I was, it happens every day.
0:03:03.640000 - 0:03:04.640000::Happened most days.
0:03:04.640000 - 0:03:05.640000::It was not overcast.
0:03:05.640000 - 0:03:06.640000::That's right.
0:03:06.640000 - 0:03:12::And I looked this up the only, there's a thing called Sun Downer's syndrome.
0:03:12 - 0:03:14.280000::So guess who this, guess who's getting this?
0:03:14.280000 - 0:03:20.400000::It's 85 year olds with dementia and they go bananas when the Sunsets, because I don't
0:03:20.400000 - 0:03:24.080000::know they've been awake to, their brain is getting tired from being awake that long.
0:03:24.080000 - 0:03:27.840000::So it's not a bad sun downer syndrome.
0:03:27.840000 - 0:03:28.840000::Sun downer.
0:03:28.840000 - 0:03:30.840000::Oh, that's really close to down syndrome.
0:03:30.840000 - 0:03:31.840000::Sun downer.
0:03:31.840000 - 0:03:32.840000::Sun downer.
0:03:32.840000 - 0:03:33.840000::Sun downer.
0:03:33.840000 - 0:03:34.840000::Sun downer.
0:03:34.840000 - 0:03:35.840000::Well, what is it?
0:03:35.840000 - 0:03:38.920000::You just go lose your mind when the Sunsets like nobody could explain it.
0:03:38.920000 - 0:03:40.840000::My therapist was flabbergasted.
0:03:40.840000 - 0:03:41.840000::I'm flabbergasted.
0:03:41.840000 - 0:03:43.600000::My friends think I'm odd.
0:03:43.600000 - 0:03:44.600000::And then what happens?
0:03:44.600000 - 0:03:49.680000::I get the full rest from getting the CPAP machine and all of a sudden anxiety goes away.
0:03:49.680000 - 0:03:51.760000::My personality gets even better.
0:03:51.760000 - 0:03:53.680000::And I'm no longer afraid of the Sunsets.
0:03:53.680000 - 0:03:56.160000::My personality's getting fucking stupid.
0:03:56.160000 - 0:03:57.160000::I don't know.
0:03:57.160000 - 0:04:00.280000::I think I don't, I can't, I can't say that's true.
0:04:00.280000 - 0:04:01.280000::You had enough of my ass.
0:04:01.280000 - 0:04:03.280000::This last fucking 20 days.
0:04:03.280000 - 0:04:06.760000::I could tell you fucking over my ass.
0:04:06.760000 - 0:04:07.760000::Eric's like, that's not possible.
0:04:07.760000 - 0:04:09.560000::Eric's the most annoying person on the planet.
0:04:09.560000 - 0:04:10.560000::You're just trying to chill.
0:04:10.560000 - 0:04:13.400000::He just like pops up it like fucking bust the door open.
0:04:13.400000 - 0:04:15.400000::He's like like just trying to.
0:04:15.400000 - 0:04:18.480000::He's like, I'm all fucking wet.
0:04:18.480000 - 0:04:20.120000::I'll wet.
0:04:20.120000 - 0:04:24.440000::Yeah, you know, Eric's always licking syrup off his fingers or something.
0:04:24.440000 - 0:04:28.080000::I should someone's hand recently who got out of the bathroom and you know, people make
0:04:28.080000 - 0:04:30.800000::kind of a show of like, oh, sorry, my hands on wet.
0:04:30.800000 - 0:04:31.800000::And I wipe it on them.
0:04:31.800000 - 0:04:34.280000::So this guy just full wet.
0:04:34.280000 - 0:04:36.040000::Not no fucking attempt.
0:04:36.040000 - 0:04:37.040000::Just full wet.
0:04:37.040000 - 0:04:38.040000::And that's me.
0:04:38.040000 - 0:04:39.040000::No apologies.
0:04:39.040000 - 0:04:40.040000::I respected that.
0:04:40.040000 - 0:04:41.040000::I respected the hell out of that.
0:04:41.040000 - 0:04:48.360000::If your hand is wet from washing your hand, go shake, shake someone's hand, look them
0:04:48.360000 - 0:04:52.560000::in the eyes and be like, what, you think that I just peed on my hand or something?
0:04:52.560000 - 0:04:53.560000::Like what do you think it was?
0:04:53.560000 - 0:04:54.560000::Oh, dude.
0:04:54.560000 - 0:04:55.560000::It's so real.
0:04:55.560000 - 0:04:58.920000::I think that my hand's wet right now for some sort of mysterious reason besides I just
0:04:58.920000 - 0:04:59.920000::washed my hands.
0:04:59.920000 - 0:05:00.920000::Like go.

0:05:00 - 0:05:02.460000::go ahead and say something if you fucking think that.
0:05:02.460000 - 0:05:03.960000::That's what it should be so lucky.
0:05:03.960000 - 0:05:05.080000::You really should be so lucky.
0:05:05.080000 - 0:05:07.440000::When the water wars begin, that'll be a sign of respect
0:05:07.440000 - 0:05:09::of like yo, I got you.
0:05:09 - 0:05:11.560000::I've just paid $25 to wash my hands.
0:05:11.560000 - 0:05:13.200000::And I know you're fucking poor right now.
0:05:13.200000 - 0:05:15.320000::So here take a little bit of the moisture.
0:05:15.320000 - 0:05:16.680000::Your hands are all fucking dirty.
0:05:16.680000 - 0:05:18.080000::Your fingernails look like shit, brother.
0:05:18.080000 - 0:05:19.880000::So here's a little shake.
0:05:19.880000 - 0:05:21.040000::Your hands are drinking.
0:05:21.040000 - 0:05:21.880000::My hands are drinking.
0:05:21.880000 - 0:05:22.480000::$25.
0:05:22.480000 - 0:05:23.400000::Friends are drinking.
0:05:25.120000 - 0:05:25.960000::Amen.
0:05:25.960000 - 0:05:28.760000::Well, that brings us really smoothly
0:05:28.760000 - 0:05:31.560000::into the theme of today, which is recovery.
0:05:31.560000 - 0:05:32.560000::Right.
0:05:32.560000 - 0:05:34.760000::Recovery.
0:05:34.760000 - 0:05:36.920000::Let's just say that life is damaging.
0:05:36.920000 - 0:05:40.880000::Being awake, even being alive, it's like stepping
0:05:40.880000 - 0:05:43.800000::into outer space essentially every time you wake up.
0:05:43.800000 - 0:05:45.280000::We're not meant to be on this plane.
0:05:45.280000 - 0:05:46.520000::It's not natural.
0:05:46.520000 - 0:05:49.120000::Every night we get what they call sleepy
0:05:49.120000 - 0:05:50.840000::and you have to go to bed.
0:05:50.840000 - 0:05:53.200000::Because it is so painful to even be here.
0:05:53.200000 - 0:05:56.880000::You know the pool of souls is from Hercules?
0:05:56.880000 - 0:05:57.400000::Oh, yeah.
0:05:57.400000 - 0:05:58.640000::It's a Disney movie.
0:05:58.640000 - 0:06:00.080000::So basically you can go in there
0:06:00.080000 - 0:06:01.640000::and you can learn knowledge and stuff
0:06:01.640000 - 0:06:03.920000::from incredible souls from history,
0:06:03.920000 - 0:06:05.960000::Greek mythology and such.
0:06:05.960000 - 0:06:10.200000::But it starts wearing down on you like a frickin ancient
0:06:10.200000 - 0:06:13.280000::Greek method type of situation, man.
0:06:13.280000 - 0:06:14.640000::And you got to come back out.
0:06:14.640000 - 0:06:16.400000::And that's where Earth is.
0:06:16.400000 - 0:06:18.040000::We're dying, but we ain't dead.
0:06:18.040000 - 0:06:19.960000::We're dying, but we ain't dead.
0:06:19.960000 - 0:06:21.160000::Not yet.
0:06:21.160000 - 0:06:22.400000::You know what I'm saying?
0:06:22.400000 - 0:06:23.240000::I know what you're saying.
0:06:23.240000 - 0:06:24.560000::And it is an active deteriorate.
0:06:24.560000 - 0:06:27.040000::Like just being here is an active deterioration.
0:06:27.040000 - 0:06:28.800000::It's an active resilience.
0:06:28.800000 - 0:06:29.640000::But it wears you down.
0:06:29.640000 - 0:06:31.120000::So how do you fucking reduce?
0:06:31.120000 - 0:06:31.960000::How do you reduce?
0:06:31.960000 - 0:06:33.400000::I've been thrown around the country
0:06:33.400000 - 0:06:34.760000::in ways people can't imagine.
0:06:34.760000 - 0:06:36.520000::LA twice in the last fucking month.
0:06:36.520000 - 0:06:38.160000::What else?
0:06:38.160000 - 0:06:40.240000::No, come on.
0:06:40.240000 - 0:06:41.480000::I can't imagine that.
0:06:41.480000 - 0:06:43.320000::Not much else, but you know what I'm saying?
0:06:43.320000 - 0:06:45.840000::I've been fucking thrown across a country
0:06:45.840000 - 0:06:47.240000::a thousand miles an hour.
0:06:47.240000 - 0:06:49.880000::And I'm tired.
0:06:49.880000 - 0:06:51.480000::I know you guys are doing,
0:06:51.520000 - 0:06:55.120000::you guys are doing that kind of too, but...
0:06:55.120000 - 0:06:56.600000::Well, it hits you.
0:06:56.600000 - 0:06:57.600000::How do we come back?
0:06:57.600000 - 0:06:59.080000::It hits you harder.
0:06:59.080000 - 0:06:59.920000::Because I'll say...
0:06:59.920000 - 0:07:01.720000::Plus, I gotta say this real quick.
0:07:01.720000 - 0:07:03::Yeah.
0:07:03 - 0:07:04.400000::I'm sick right now.
0:07:04.400000 - 0:07:05.400000::God, yeah.
0:07:05.400000 - 0:07:06.240000::I am fucking...
0:07:06.240000 - 0:07:09.960000::Another joy-tactician has been hit by a mud.

0:07:13.240000 - 0:07:14.840000::What is up with germs, man?
0:07:14.840000 - 0:07:15.680000::I've seen it.

0:07:36.320000 - 0:07:38.280000::People are fucking turning it off.
0:07:38.280000 - 0:07:39.120000::Can I share this?
0:07:39.120000 - 0:07:40.920000::I sent this to...
0:07:40.920000 - 0:07:44.480000::to Eric because I sent him...
0:07:44.480000 - 0:07:48.200000::Sometimes I send him some really embarrassing auditions
0:07:48.200000 - 0:07:50.160000::that I get sent.
0:07:50.160000 - 0:07:54.080000::I get sent the worst auditions on Planet Earth.
0:07:54.080000 - 0:07:56.480000::This is a sag approved audition, by the way,
0:07:56.480000 - 0:07:58.160000::for a new media agreement.
0:07:58.160000 - 0:07:59::Of course, of course.
0:07:59 - 0:08:00.400000::And it's for...
0:08:00.400000 - 0:08:01.960000::Door the Explorer.
0:08:01.960000 - 0:08:03.600000::Oh!

0:08:06.560000 - 0:08:09.560000::You are going to be a Spanish-speaking napkin.
0:08:09.560000 - 0:08:11.600000::And it was for the sneaky fox.
0:08:11.600000 - 0:08:16.040000::And this is like day one of my debilitating sickness
0:08:16.040000 - 0:08:17.880000::or my voice is all like...
0:08:17.880000 - 0:08:19.520000::My voice is like so fucked up.
0:08:19.520000 - 0:08:22.720000::I couldn't even replicate the voice that I did
0:08:22.720000 - 0:08:25.840000::in this audition if I tried.
0:08:25.840000 - 0:08:26.840000::And it was the most...
0:08:26.840000 - 0:08:28.960000::Maybe the most humiliating thing.
0:08:30.320000 - 0:08:31.960000::One of the most humiliating auditions
0:08:31.960000 - 0:08:33.160000::I've ever done in my life.

0:08:42.120000 - 0:08:43.640000::What, what, what?
0:08:44.800000 - 0:08:45.640000::It's not right.
0:08:45.640000 - 0:08:46.840000::Can you play it for us?
0:08:46.840000 - 0:08:47.680000::No.
0:08:48.680000 - 0:08:50.400000::Like, did you definitely not get it?
0:08:50.400000 - 0:08:51.720000::I'll play this, though.
0:08:51.720000 - 0:08:53.760000::Well, there's no way the door of the Explorer

0:08:54.760000 - 0:08:56.080000::and tuning in.
0:08:56.080000 - 0:08:58.400000::And if so, we're fucking riding in that.
0:08:58.400000 - 0:08:59.400000::It's a...
0:08:59.400000 - 0:09:00.400000::I like...
0:09:00.400000 - 0:09:01.400000::Okay.

0:09:03.400000 - 0:09:04.600000::I'm not gonna play the whole thing
0:09:04.600000 - 0:09:05.880000::just because I really can't...
0:09:05.880000 - 0:09:07.560000::This is the most cringy thing on this.
0:09:07.560000 - 0:09:08.840000::I can't believe I'm doing this.
0:09:08.840000 - 0:09:10.360000::Oh my god.

0:09:55.920000 - 0:09:56.920000::You're right, dude.
0:09:56.920000 - 0:09:59.920000::I need to have some more perspective on this.

0:10:00 - 0:10:06.580000::If this sickness had gone the other way if it had gone south and that was basically the last evidence that we have
0:10:07.080000 - 0:10:09.080000::Nate for own the life and legacy of him

0:10:28.920000 - 0:10:37.380000::He the show must go on even where if we're on strike we got to go get the bread that we're not gonna really end up getting probably but
0:10:40.120000 - 0:10:42.560000::There's something about auditions that brings out a
0:10:43.400000 - 0:10:46.400000::Version of everybody that is so good

0:11:31.600000 - 0:11:36.800000::Celebrities on them and people are wondering is this you guys have guests on do not have guests listen
0:11:36.800000 - 0:11:41.720000::We don't know how we're doing this yet. There's gonna be some with guests some with out guests, okay?

0:12:14.920000 - 0:12:20.760000::They don't give a fuck about anything else except us three being the most authentic versions of ourselves
0:12:21.120000 - 0:12:26.320000::As possible. Yeah, how they spell authenticity in 2023. How's that?

0:19:21.640000 - 0:19:24.240000::every single day and then go back.
0:19:24.240000 - 0:19:25.880000::And it took a long time to do that.

0:25:46.040000 - 0:25:49.480000::Remember how pirates would wash upon shore
0:25:49.480000 - 0:25:50.520000::and they would kiss the sand
0:25:50.520000 - 0:25:53.080000::because they're so happy to be on sand?
0:25:53.080000 - 0:25:55.320000::Did that way you did when you got to Phoenix?

0:26:00.160000 - 0:26:01::with the city of Phoenix.
0:26:01 - 0:26:02.840000::It felt to your knees when you saw Phoenix.
0:26:02.840000 - 0:26:04.160000::Oh, look.
0:26:04.160000 - 0:26:05.880000::Before the plane even touched down,
0:26:05.880000 - 0:26:07.480000::I was like shaking the people next to me.
0:26:07.480000 - 0:26:09.880000::By the way, I'm sitting on the plane.
0:26:09.880000 - 0:26:11.760000::What the fuck was that guy doing next to me?
0:26:11.760000 - 0:26:14.520000::I swear every three seconds he was going like this,
0:26:14.520000 - 0:26:16.400000::lookin' over at my laptop like this.
0:26:18.640000 - 0:26:20.440000::Well, they know there are months
0:26:20.440000 - 0:26:23.280000::that's manipulating our lives and changing everything.
0:26:23.280000 - 0:26:25.120000::You know what I'm talkin' about.
0:26:25.160000 - 0:26:25.960000::I know you're talkin' about,
0:26:25.960000 - 0:26:28.760000::don't bring them up because I don't wanna get shot again.
0:26:28.760000 - 0:26:31.160000::Speaking of getting shot, ooh we.
0:26:31.160000 - 0:26:36.160000::So I do a little teaser of what some of my material
0:26:36.320000 - 0:26:38::is these days that I'm working through is a bit
0:26:38 - 0:26:41.520000::where I talk about how Jews should lean into being
0:26:41.520000 - 0:26:43.640000::the people who killed Jesus Christ.
0:26:43.640000 - 0:26:47.360000::And it's a joke, but when I do that,
0:26:47.360000 - 0:26:50.480000::some of these, it's also a offensive.
0:26:50.480000 - 0:26:52.960000::And that's the fun thing about comedy
0:26:52.960000 - 0:26:55.880000::is you're towing a line that is,
0:26:55.880000 - 0:26:57.440000::that's what risk taking is all about.
0:26:57.440000 - 0:27:00.960000::That's what comedy is is all about is all about risks taking.
0:27:00.960000 - 0:27:03.560000::And that's what it felt like on stage in Arizona
0:27:03.560000 - 0:27:06.120000::doing these types of bits is I felt like
0:27:06.120000 - 0:27:08::I am at risk of being shot.
0:27:09.360000 - 0:27:11.040000::That was the energy I was gettin'.
0:27:11.040000 - 0:27:15.880000::And, oof, there's not a better mind set to be in
0:27:15.880000 - 0:27:18.880000::than like be an exhausted, getting no sleep,
0:27:18.880000 - 0:27:22.240000::moving for three days, trying to get over cold in the rain,
0:27:22.240000 - 0:27:25.080000::and then go straight on stage into an audience
0:27:25.080000 - 0:27:26.280000::that doesn't know who you are.
0:27:26.280000 - 0:27:27.520000::Oh hell yeah.
0:27:27.520000 - 0:27:28.520000::What could be better?
0:27:28.520000 - 0:27:30.840000::These are the trials, these are the trials we'll remember.
0:27:30.840000 - 0:27:31.680000::These trials, man.
0:27:31.680000 - 0:27:32.760000::It's all I gotta say.
0:27:32.760000 - 0:27:36.560000::But there's no that probably went through that same
0:27:36.560000 - 0:27:38.080000::exact scenario, Jack.
0:27:38.080000 - 0:27:40.880000::Jesus H. Donald J. Trump Christ.

0:36:53.600000 - 0:36:55.840000::And we thought like, oh, this is going to be so much fun.
0:36:55.880000 - 0:36:59::Had no idea like people were even like competitive with
0:36:59 - 0:37:00.200000::Pokemon cards.
0:37:01.080000 - 0:37:06::And it was just all adults that were like losers.

0:37:34.240000 - 0:37:34.800000::good card.
0:37:34.880000 - 0:37:36.360000::Have you ever thought about it like that, Nate?
0:37:36.360000 - 0:37:38.640000::Are you yourself just to open your eyes and see what you do?
0:37:38.640000 - 0:37:41.280000::There's a little bit, there's some backstory people should know that

0:39:24 - 0:39:26.960000::So we would steal these cards to try and like level our decks up.
0:39:27.240000 - 0:39:30.360000::So we could fight against adults at these tournaments.
0:39:30.360000 - 0:39:30.960000::Damn.

0:41:02.760000 - 0:41:06.560000::because it pulls up and it's got a little siren display
0:41:06.560000 - 0:41:08.360000::up top that says my name on it.
0:41:08.360000 - 0:41:12.280000::And then I click unlock the car from my phone, we get in.

0:42:31.560000 - 0:42:34.560000::And I'm like, I see people fucking kicking these things.
0:42:34.560000 - 0:42:37.560000::I see people fucking throwing lime scooters in the fucking river
0:42:37.560000 - 0:42:39.560000::like they don't fucking feel themselves drowning.
0:42:39.560000 - 0:42:41.560000::I see the fucking rebel scooters in New York
0:42:41.560000 - 0:42:43.560000::fucking being flooded by global warming floods
0:42:43.560000 - 0:42:46.560000::and being washed around like garbage.
0:42:46.560000 - 0:42:48.560000::It makes me sick because we...
0:42:49.560000 - 0:42:50.560000::We don't know.
0:42:50.560000 - 0:42:52.560000::We're not smart enough to know what life is yet.
0:42:52.560000 - 0:42:55.560000::And that could be life in these fucking creations.
0:42:55.560000 - 0:42:56.560000::Okay.
0:42:56.560000 - 0:42:57.560000::Well, you know what it's very interesting.
0:42:57.560000 - 0:42:59.560000::We'll say that word in our creation.
0:42:59.560000 - 0:43:01.560000::When we listen to Congress speak about this stuff.
0:43:01.560000 - 0:43:03.560000::Finds nine.
0:43:03.560000 - 0:43:06.560000::She's not with us anymore, man.
0:43:06.560000 - 0:43:08.560000::Let it go, man.
0:43:08.560000 - 0:43:09.560000::She's gone.
0:43:09.560000 - 0:43:10.560000::She's not coming back.
0:43:10.560000 - 0:43:13.560000::I know she was your girl, but you got to find a new one, man.
0:43:13.560000 - 0:43:15.560000::You got to find a new one.
0:43:15.560000 - 0:43:16.560000::RBG here.
0:43:16.560000 - 0:43:17.560000::Yeah.
0:43:17.560000 - 0:43:18.560000::We are.
0:43:18.560000 - 0:43:20.560000::This is the end of America.
0:43:20.560000 - 0:43:24.560000::But the thing is, the way that they speak about AI.
0:43:24.560000 - 0:43:28.560000::Notice that they use the word day.
0:43:28.560000 - 0:43:30.560000::They don't use the word it when they're talking...
0:43:30.560000 - 0:43:32.560000::Or it or these things or things.
0:43:32.560000 - 0:43:34.560000::They say you can't...
0:43:34.560000 - 0:43:36.560000::You know, if it's for something...
0:43:36.560000 - 0:43:39.560000::We can't let them come up with these ideas.
0:43:39.560000 - 0:43:42.560000::We can't give our work forces away to them.
0:43:42.560000 - 0:43:44.560000::We've already...
0:43:44.560000 - 0:43:46.560000::We inherently understand and accept that.
0:43:46.560000 - 0:43:49.560000::Organic matter has nothing to do with consciousness.
0:43:49.560000 - 0:43:51.560000::This can...
0:43:51.560000 - 0:43:54.560000::This is why I stopped throwing things away.
0:43:54.560000 - 0:43:57.560000::This is why I have all these boxes in my room.
0:43:57.560000 - 0:43:59.560000::It's because...
0:43:59.560000 - 0:44:01.560000::I'm not a hoarder.
0:44:01.560000 - 0:44:02.560000::I'm a...
0:44:02.560000 - 0:44:03.560000::What do you call it?

0:44:05.560000 - 0:44:06.560000::An intimate object?
0:44:06.560000 - 0:44:07.560000::Can I talk to you yet?
0:44:07.560000 - 0:44:12.560000::An intimate object that I can hear by putting like a step
0:44:12.560000 - 0:44:13.560000::of scope up to them.
0:44:13.560000 - 0:44:15.560000::Would you guys allow me to point in the direction of a fee?
0:44:15.560000 - 0:44:16.560000::Of course, man.
0:44:16.560000 - 0:44:18.560000::I pay a service to get some money.

0:44:24.560000 - 0:44:29.560000::And guess who plays the most sexy sounding AI you've ever heard in your life.
0:44:29.560000 - 0:44:30.560000::Agent Cody Bay.
0:44:30.560000 - 0:44:32.560000::Agent Scarlett.

0:46:47.440000 - 0:46:51.800000::Give away with nature and beings that is just, I've never seen somebody connect with nature
0:46:51.800000 - 0:46:53.220000::in the way that you do with critters.

0:47:10.720000 - 0:47:12.720000::They see me as kind of one of them.
0:47:12.720000 - 0:47:14.280000::Well, I'll be rubbed.
0:47:14.280000 - 0:47:15.280000::I'll be rubbed.
0:47:15.280000 - 0:47:16.280000::I'm not.

0:47:29.520000 - 0:47:31.800000::Well, I didn't hear you at first of all.
0:47:31.800000 - 0:47:33.280000::That's not possible.
0:47:33.280000 - 0:47:36.200000::You can't jerk off from the neck.
0:47:36.200000 - 0:47:38.880000::People must have done some crazy shit to horses in the past.
0:47:38.880000 - 0:47:39.880000::You imagine being a cat.
0:47:39.880000 - 0:47:40.880000::In the past?
0:47:41.280000 - 0:47:44.440000::Well, try in the future or try now, rather.
0:47:48.080000 - 0:47:49.480000::It's tough to go back to zoom in.
0:47:49.480000 - 0:47:50.480000::I know.
0:47:50.480000 - 0:47:51.480000::That's how I'm feeling.
0:47:51.480000 - 0:47:53.480000::Psych, I'm not feeling that way.
0:47:53.480000 - 0:47:59.480000::So here, when you're on a horse, like what would you ever consider
0:47:59.480000 - 0:48:00.480000::purchasing a horse?
0:48:00.480000 - 0:48:01.480000::What would you name it?
0:48:01.480000 - 0:48:03.480000::Would you let it sleep in the house in the crib?
0:48:03.480000 - 0:48:04.480000::Would you feed it human pizza?
0:48:04.480000 - 0:48:06.280000::Like what's the story?
0:48:06.280000 - 0:48:07.280000::What are you going to do?

0:48:10.880000 - 0:48:12.680000::But here's the thing.
0:48:12.680000 - 0:48:16.480000::When you get a horse, these things are not just like a dog
0:48:16.480000 - 0:48:19.080000::and a dog lives for 10 to 15 years.
0:48:19.080000 - 0:48:21.880000::It's not like a durable that lives for much less.
0:48:21.880000 - 0:48:25.680000::These things can be fucking 25 year old units
0:48:25.680000 - 0:48:27.680000::and you're with them for a third.
0:48:27.680000 - 0:48:29.080000::They can live to 30.
0:48:29.080000 - 0:48:30.080000::You know what I'm saying?
0:48:30.080000 - 0:48:32.480000::That's an adult child.
0:48:32.480000 - 0:48:33.880000::You know what I mean?
0:48:33.880000 - 0:48:36.280000::I mean, that's a lifetime almost to spend.
0:48:36.280000 - 0:48:39.880000::So you better really, and those horses are smart.
0:48:39.880000 - 0:48:42.080000::Okay, so you can't fuck with the horse.
0:48:42.080000 - 0:48:44.080000::Oh, bro.
0:48:44.080000 - 0:48:45.480000::Are horses smart?
0:48:45.480000 - 0:48:46.680000::Are they smart?
0:48:46.680000 - 0:48:49.280000::Yeah, they just can't type like we can.
0:48:49.280000 - 0:48:50.280000::You know what I'm saying?
0:48:50.280000 - 0:48:53.280000::Oh, you know what I was thinking the other day?
0:48:53.280000 - 0:48:55.480000::I was looking, I'm thinking about these horses that are going
0:48:55.480000 - 0:48:56.480000::around Central Park.
0:48:56.480000 - 0:48:59.080000::And they're thinking, man, my life is amazing.
0:48:59.080000 - 0:49:02.280000::Thank God I get these blinders on because I love the pave way
0:49:02.280000 - 0:49:03.280000::of the Central Park.
0:49:03.280000 - 0:49:05.680000::But I hate all the fucking nature of it because it reminds me
0:49:05.680000 - 0:49:08.080000::of where I was captured from.
0:49:08.080000 - 0:49:11.080000::And I was thinking, is there is the only thing?
0:49:11.080000 - 0:49:14.040000::Is the only thing that is stopping a horse from killing
0:49:14.040000 - 0:49:16.640000::itself that it doesn't have thumbs?
0:49:16.640000 - 0:49:20.240000::If a horse had an opposable thumb, would it fucking grab the gun
0:49:20.240000 - 0:49:23.560000::from a cop standing next to it and say enough is enough?
0:49:23.560000 - 0:49:27.280000::I'm going to take out myself and others around me.
0:49:27.280000 - 0:49:29.280000::First of all, can a gun even kill a horse?
0:49:29.280000 - 0:49:30.280000::I guess so.
0:49:30.280000 - 0:49:31.280000::But those things seem so big.
0:49:31.280000 - 0:49:32.280000::I can't believe that works.
0:49:32.280000 - 0:49:34.560000::Now they'll take a couple, a couple shots.
0:49:34.560000 - 0:49:38.040000::I think it would take a, I think it would take a couple
0:49:38.040000 - 0:49:43.440000::of loaded AK-47s to take out a horse.
0:49:43.440000 - 0:49:47.240000::Nate, do you think you could bite through a horse?
0:49:47.240000 - 0:49:50.240000::Let's stop it right there with the horse play.
0:49:50.240000 - 0:49:51.240000::OK.
0:49:51.240000 - 0:49:55.160000::Whenever I see a horse get fucking injured in a movie, it's
0:49:55.160000 - 0:49:57.360000::fucking, let me get that director's email right now.
0:49:57.360000 - 0:49:59.880000::Send my son a paragraph, fucking my thoughts on why
0:49:59.880000 - 0:50:00.880000::that's going on.

0:50:00 - 0:50:02.240000::I shouldn't be showing horses get hurt like that.
0:50:02.240000 - 0:50:03.680000::I can't stand it.
0:50:03.680000 - 0:50:08.680000::I can't stand any horse that you see in a movie pre 1997,
0:50:08.680000 - 0:50:11.920000::died at the fucking last day of shooting.
0:50:11.920000 - 0:50:12.760000::No question.
0:50:12.760000 - 0:50:14.440000::They died during the shoot.
0:50:14.440000 - 0:50:17.480000::Thanks for having that horse in the ring.
0:50:17.480000 - 0:50:22.800000::Remember that horse committed suicide off the back of a boat.
0:50:23.040000 - 0:50:26.840000::Remember the ring, the ring.
0:50:26.840000 - 0:50:27.720000::It's a horror film.
0:50:27.720000 - 0:50:28.560000::Oh, what?
0:50:28.560000 - 0:50:29.560000::With hair.
0:50:29.560000 - 0:50:31.560000::She climbs.
0:50:33.560000 - 0:50:35.400000::She climbs out of a well.
0:50:35.400000 - 0:50:38.320000::And at one point, they're on a cruise ship or a ferry or something.
0:50:38.600000 - 0:50:42.240000::And a horse comes running out of nowhere or whatever they sound like.
0:50:42.240000 - 0:50:44.640000::And then everybody kind of gets out of the way.
0:50:44.640000 - 0:50:46.520000::Maybe it's been a while since I saw this.
0:50:46.520000 - 0:50:49.120000::I remember a pretty sure a horse commits suicide.
0:50:49.120000 - 0:50:50.120000::Jump.
0:50:50.120000 - 0:50:51::I think you're correct.
0:50:51 - 0:50:52.320000::Oh, hell to them.
0:50:52.320000 - 0:50:54.800000::Get swallowed up by the ocean and bloody style.
0:50:56.320000 - 0:50:58.200000::I just watched Michael Clayton talking about that.
0:50:58.200000 - 0:51:00.320000::I just watched Michael Clayton again.
0:51:01.080000 - 0:51:03.040000::Remember Michael Clayton, George Clooney,
0:51:03.040000 - 0:51:04.320000::I think you're about piano.
0:51:04.800000 - 0:51:10.200000::And I watched it on the plane and there's a scene early on where George Clooney gets out of his car,
0:51:10.200000 - 0:51:11.200000::walks up the hill.
0:51:11.200000 - 0:51:13.560000::He's entranced by three horses at top of hill.
0:51:14.840000 - 0:51:19.560000::And he looks at them and the look that he gives these horses is exactly what I feel every time I see a horse,
0:51:19.560000 - 0:51:25.160000::which is mystery astoundment, not knowing what they're thinking, wishing I could know what they thought.
0:51:25.760000 - 0:51:32.320000::Because these horses have you know, you can just look into their fucking eyes and they're saying so much without words.
0:51:32.800000 - 0:51:33.520000::Yes, peace.
0:51:34.960000 - 0:51:36.840000::And I just wanted to thank the director of that movie.
0:51:36.840000 - 0:51:40.600000::Thank George Clooney for including that in there because it's really how I feel.
0:51:42.320000 - 0:51:44.520000::George Clooney is an inspiration for so much.
0:51:44.520000 - 0:51:47.320000::And your lifestyle, even too, Eric.
0:51:47.640000 - 0:51:50.160000::I legit love George Clooney's in some.
0:51:50.240000 - 0:51:51.240000::Let me watch it now.
0:51:52.080000 - 0:51:53.240000::I'll let me watch that.
0:51:53.240000 - 0:51:54.560000::He's the real Tom Cruise.
0:51:54.720000 - 0:51:56.040000::He's got so much charm.
0:51:56.040000 - 0:51:58.400000::No, where are the actors with charm these days?
0:51:59.400000 - 0:52:00.120000::I don't know.
0:52:00.120000 - 0:52:00.800000::I don't know.
0:52:00.800000 - 0:52:02.600000::He kind of brings the one that I meet.
0:52:03.600000 - 0:52:07.520000::He's got like a rat pack in, you know, vibe to him.
0:52:08.240000 - 0:52:09.600000::Rat classic style.
0:52:09.600000 - 0:52:10.880000::Where did the men go?
0:52:11 - 0:52:12.400000::Where did the real men go?
0:52:13.120000 - 0:52:17.280000::What happened to show vines or what's the one?
0:52:18.800000 - 0:52:20.280000::Chivalry, civil, civil, civil.
0:52:20.280000 - 0:52:21.520000::Oh, it's dead.
0:52:22.080000 - 0:52:22.600000::It's right.
0:52:22.600000 - 0:52:23.120000::He did.
0:52:23.680000 - 0:52:26.480000::Or does it live in New York City and Nate's house in LA?
0:52:27.440000 - 0:52:30.840000::Because I see gentlemen left and right when I walk around New York.
0:52:30.920000 - 0:52:32.720000::And they're not movie stars, by the way.
0:52:32.920000 - 0:52:33.880000::That's the problem.
0:52:34.360000 - 0:52:35.560000::They used to be movie stars.
0:52:35.560000 - 0:52:40.880000::But now for some reason, this must be some greater plan to keep gentlemen out of Hollywood.
0:52:40.880000 - 0:52:43.280000::But they're a gentleman in the real world.
0:52:44.440000 - 0:52:44.920000::What about it?
0:52:44.920000 - 0:52:49.120000::Well, Nate's house is just doubt everything, all the spoons, everything in the house is
0:52:49.120000 - 0:52:50.360000::doused in musk.
0:52:50.680000 - 0:52:55.400000::He spent hell of money at CVS, but all the musk CVS has dipped all of it in musk.
0:52:56.080000 - 0:52:57.200000::He barely alone.
0:52:57.400000 - 0:52:57.920000::Yeah.
0:52:58.720000 - 0:52:59.400000::Yeah.
0:53:00.800000 - 0:53:01.480000::Yeah.
0:53:02.080000 - 0:53:03.640000::Well, how about horse bud?
0:53:04.040000 - 0:53:04.640000::Horse bud.
0:53:04.640000 - 0:53:05.800000::Horse bud like weed.
0:53:05.800000 - 0:53:09.080000::Oh, like now that this strikes over, I'm thinking about movies, I guess.
0:53:09.080000 - 0:53:09.560000::Oh, oh,
0:53:09.560000 - 0:53:10.840000::this movie's down again.
0:53:10.840000 - 0:53:12.200000::Awesome fucking hose.
0:53:12.600000 - 0:53:17.880000::Oh, maybe if airbud is like, you know, open the open the open the open the
0:53:18.520000 - 0:53:19.680000::kind of worms.
0:53:19.680000 - 0:53:25.640000::Oh, I saw the I drove in front of the air bud director in his license plate was air bud.
0:53:26.280000 - 0:53:27.960000::And I was like, he's better be care.
0:53:27.960000 - 0:53:31.680000::He probably gets a fucking dog by fans every day.
0:53:32.800000 - 0:53:33.320000::Masses.
0:53:33.320000 - 0:53:33.960000::Look at us.
0:53:33.960000 - 0:53:35.760000::And it was like, oh, this is a very funny.
0:53:37 - 0:53:38.520000::Eric, very funny joke.
0:53:38.760000 - 0:53:41::You know, I didn't even think of that when I said dog.
0:53:41.840000 - 0:53:43.040000::I know it's natural.
0:53:43.040000 - 0:53:44.760000::It's just natural for me to put the two to get.
0:53:44.760000 - 0:53:46.800000::I want to say this though, but horses before he stopped it, but
0:53:47.480000 - 0:53:48.840000::horses can be killers too.
0:53:49.080000 - 0:53:51.360000::Okay, don't think that these are all sweet creatures.
0:53:51.360000 - 0:53:51.800000::Okay.
0:53:52.720000 - 0:53:54.320000::Remember what they did to Christopher Reeves?
0:53:55.360000 - 0:53:55.680000::Nope.
0:53:55.960000 - 0:53:57.080000::I remember Christopher Reeves.
0:53:58.080000 - 0:53:58.400000::Nope.
0:53:58.680000 - 0:54:02.640000::He played Superman and then he was kicked in the head by a.
0:54:02.880000 - 0:54:03.720000::That's how he went.
0:54:05.160000 - 0:54:08.040000::Well, no, well, he was alive for many years later.
0:54:08.040000 - 0:54:09.960000::He was paralyzed unfortunately for the neck down.
0:54:10.200000 - 0:54:10.800000::Oh, really?
0:54:11.280000 - 0:54:12.240000::And Robin Williams.
0:54:12.240000 - 0:54:13.160000::Christopher Reeves.
0:54:13.160000 - 0:54:16.760000::Robin Williams is was the type of guy to go cheer his ass.
0:54:16.800000 - 0:54:19::Up in the hospital, pretending to be a doctor.
0:54:19.320000 - 0:54:21.880000::Now, who do we have in the comedy community right now?
0:54:22.040000 - 0:54:25.560000::If you think, if you got hit in the head by a horse and you're if I can die in there,
0:54:25.560000 - 0:54:28.440000::do you think Bill Burwood come through dresses as a surgeon,
0:54:28.440000 - 0:54:30.640000::speaking in a Russian accent and say, can I.
0:54:31.680000 - 0:54:33.560000::Tom for your animal, something like that.
0:54:33.600000 - 0:54:35.680000::That's what Robin Williams did for his friend.
0:54:36.600000 - 0:54:38.920000::There's nobody who's doing this comedy style anymore.
0:54:39.360000 - 0:54:39.680000::Okay.
0:54:39.800000 - 0:54:45.280000::I woke up at 7 a.m. this morning and I thought and I thought and I was like,
0:54:45.280000 - 0:54:48.640000::dang it. My alarm does go off till eight.
0:54:49.320000 - 0:54:50.400000::But why am I awake?
0:54:50.440000 - 0:54:52.560000::Why did God wake me up earlier today?
0:54:53.600000 - 0:54:54.880000::I check my phone naturally.
0:54:54.880000 - 0:54:55.800000::Oh, shit.
0:54:56.480000 - 0:54:57.320000::And what do I see?
0:54:58.320000 - 0:55:00.080000::Well, a bunch of

0:55:00 - 0:55:03.240000::a Chester Bennington tributes that I watch over and over again for an entire hour.
0:55:03.240000 - 0:55:05.240000::How many years did he die?
0:55:05.240000 - 0:55:06.240000::What?
0:55:06.240000 - 0:55:10.520000::How many years has he been gone?
0:55:10.520000 - 0:55:11.520000::Chester.
0:55:11.520000 - 0:55:12.520000::Five or six.
0:55:12.520000 - 0:55:13.520000::Twenty seventeen is when he passed.
0:55:13.520000 - 0:55:14.520000::I remember.
0:55:14.520000 - 0:55:15.520000::Yeah.
0:55:15.520000 - 0:55:16.520000::I remember.
0:55:16.520000 - 0:55:17.520000::That's a weird.
0:55:17.520000 - 0:55:20.360000::That's that one shook me to my fucking core.
0:55:20.360000 - 0:55:21.360000::Some of those days.
0:55:21.360000 - 0:55:25.520000::A lot of people in the queen went the way that people felt about the queen.
0:55:25.520000 - 0:55:26.520000::That's how it was.
0:55:26.520000 - 0:55:31.320000::Why is it always the most surprising ones that die?
0:55:31.320000 - 0:55:32.320000::I don't know.
0:55:32.320000 - 0:55:34.640000::There's people who I see who are.
0:55:34.640000 - 0:55:35.840000::Oh no.
0:55:35.840000 - 0:55:36.840000::Yeah.
0:55:36.840000 - 0:55:38.840000::Now you've got a fucking black one.
0:55:38.840000 - 0:55:39.840000::Who's next?
0:55:39.840000 - 0:55:40.840000::Who's next for you?
0:55:40.840000 - 0:55:45.480000::I have a really, I have a list that takes up a large space in my bedroom.
0:55:45.480000 - 0:55:49.600000::It has many celebrities, enemies, people that are wrong me.
0:55:49.600000 - 0:55:50.600000::Dennis Quay.
0:55:50.600000 - 0:55:53.840000::And I just look at it for 30 minutes.
0:55:53.840000 - 0:55:57.960000::Wait, morning, 30 minutes before dinner.
0:55:57.960000 - 0:55:58.960000::Just wish harm.
0:55:58.960000 - 0:56:00.200000::Should we do that energetically?
0:56:00.200000 - 0:56:02.800000::Should we do, sorry.
0:56:02.800000 - 0:56:03.800000::What's up?
0:56:03.800000 - 0:56:05.720000::No, I cut you off.
0:56:05.720000 - 0:56:09.920000::You're talking about the ancient prayers that you do on the hit list on your fridge.
0:56:09.920000 - 0:56:13.960000::Do you think if you imagine, like if I were, if I were to write now, just imagine every
0:56:13.960000 - 0:56:18.120000::single day, just imagine Eric being crunched.
0:56:18.120000 - 0:56:23.320000::Don't even begin, dude, because some sort of machine.
0:56:23.320000 - 0:56:29.800000::Like just in a factory, just don't squash down and how to, I would say it, do imagine it
0:56:29.800000 - 0:56:33.320000::vividly every single day for three hours a day.
0:56:33.320000 - 0:56:36.160000::You're not telling me that that wouldn't do something.
0:56:36.160000 - 0:56:37.400000::I think it would do something for you.
0:56:37.400000 - 0:56:38.400000::Of course it would do something for you.
0:56:38.400000 - 0:56:39.400000::Where you would need help.
0:56:39.400000 - 0:56:41.400000::Well, it's taking me out of this.
0:56:41.400000 - 0:56:42.400000::It's taking me out of this.
0:56:42.400000 - 0:56:46.440000::Of course, I would lose my mind doing this three hours a day of imagining the same 10
0:56:46.440000 - 0:56:49.640000::second scenario over and over.
0:56:49.640000 - 0:56:50.640000::But I feel like something would happen.
0:56:50.640000 - 0:56:55.440000::The content of the scenario that's disturbing, dude, not just the practice of this.
0:56:55.440000 - 0:56:58.320000::It's my bones getting all crunched at dust.
0:56:58.320000 - 0:57:00.040000::You would fuck you guys with throw the hell out.
0:57:00.040000 - 0:57:05.120000::If you saw me get barely hurt, you guys would be wretching in the toilet.
0:57:05.120000 - 0:57:07.120000::If we saw you get smushed like a dutch or?
0:57:07.120000 - 0:57:08.120000::Yeah.
0:57:08.120000 - 0:57:09.120000::Oh God.
0:57:09.120000 - 0:57:10.120000::I would hate to fuck out of that.
0:57:10.120000 - 0:57:11.120000::We'd probably smell like shit.
0:57:11.120000 - 0:57:16.120000::If someone put a glaucoma or a macamata brain slushy, you guys would be sick.
0:57:16.120000 - 0:57:17.120000::Oh man.
0:57:17.120000 - 0:57:18.120000::I would throw up.
0:57:18.120000 - 0:57:19.120000::Yeah.
0:57:19.120000 - 0:57:20.120000::I wouldn't like that at all.
0:57:20.640000 - 0:57:22.320000::Especially if I saw it.
0:57:22.320000 - 0:57:24.440000::If I heard about it, I'd probably be shook.
0:57:24.440000 - 0:57:26.360000::But I don't know if I'd be.
0:57:26.360000 - 0:57:29.360000::I'm telling you guys don't want me to be the first to go because you guys will be
0:57:29.360000 - 0:57:35.600000::at morning for years wearing black cloaks Italian Sicily styled morning.
0:57:35.600000 - 0:57:37.600000::Oh yeah.
0:57:37.600000 - 0:57:38.600000::Just creating black food.
0:57:38.600000 - 0:57:39.600000::It's creating.
0:57:39.600000 - 0:57:42.800000::Black food dye and all my food, black sandwiches, black bread, loads of bread.
0:57:42.800000 - 0:57:44.800000::What are you doing, man?
0:57:44.800000 - 0:57:45.800000::Oh, remember?
0:57:45.800000 - 0:57:46.800000::I remember Eric.
0:57:46.800000 - 0:57:47.800000::Yeah.
0:57:47.800000 - 0:57:49.800000::Well, the day came.
0:57:49.800000 - 0:57:50.800000::Dude, that is a...
0:57:50.800000 - 0:57:54.520000::Can I make that a, like, a must at Jackier funeral?
0:57:54.520000 - 0:57:59.880000::Because you know they have the food dye to make like black, fashion meat.
0:57:59.880000 - 0:58:02.920000::That would be the funniest thing.
0:58:02.920000 - 0:58:08::I mean, listen, a lot of people are going to these wakes and eating fucking sliders on white
0:58:08 - 0:58:09.400000::bread at a funeral.
0:58:09.400000 - 0:58:10.400000::That is not a good look.
0:58:10.400000 - 0:58:11.400000::Get a squid black.
0:58:11.400000 - 0:58:12.400000::Get a squid black.
0:58:12.400000 - 0:58:17.760000::If you're not eating squid ink, uh, technically a telly and it's fucking squid ink, uh,
0:58:17.760000 - 0:58:19.520000::chabata up at the funeral.
0:58:19.520000 - 0:58:20.520000::Dark chocolate.
0:58:20.520000 - 0:58:21.520000::You hate, uh, pieces.
0:58:21.520000 - 0:58:22.520000::You hate God.
0:58:22.520000 - 0:58:23.520000::Mm-hmm.
0:58:23.520000 - 0:58:24.520000::Exactly.
0:58:24.520000 - 0:58:25.520000::Dark chocolate.
0:58:25.520000 - 0:58:26.520000::I would rock out a funeral home.
0:58:26.520000 - 0:58:29.520000::Now, I would actually, we should open the Joy Tactics funeral home assessment.
0:58:29.520000 - 0:58:30.520000::Jerry, thanks.
0:58:30.520000 - 0:58:33.120000::What are we assessing?
0:58:33.120000 - 0:58:35.800000::This, the, it's a qualitative assessment.
0:58:35.800000 - 0:58:40.920000::Uh, I, I, maybe I've said this before, but I, I think that really if we get some money
0:58:40.920000 - 0:58:46.080000::upright, if we get that Parks and Rec reboot fucking cooking and a crazy type of way,
0:58:46.080000 - 0:58:50.160000::where we all start as Amy Polar, whatever.
0:58:50.160000 - 0:58:55.160000::We need to put all the money we make into retirement homes because guess what?
0:58:55.160000 - 0:58:59.560000::There's not enough infrastructure for the baby boomers who are going to care now.
0:58:59.560000 - 0:59:02.440000::Oh, there's no infrastructure in place.
0:59:02.440000 - 0:59:03.440000::It's crazy.
0:59:03.440000 - 0:59:06.960000::The amount of money that we, people are about to make on these seniors and we can be,
0:59:06.960000 - 0:59:08.800000::some of them and we can also make their lives better.
0:59:08.800000 - 0:59:09.800000::I swear to God.
0:59:09.800000 - 0:59:14.880000::I have an end in this industry like I do a lot of different industries as well, but what
0:59:14.880000 - 0:59:15.880000::is that?
0:59:15.880000 - 0:59:16.880000::I'm trying to say this.
0:59:16.880000 - 0:59:17.880000::What is that?
0:59:17.880000 - 0:59:20.560000::Are you sure you want to say this on the air?
0:59:20.560000 - 0:59:26.120000::Well, I'm not, yes, I, I, because I, I'm not, I'm not like giving out any fucking keys
0:59:26.120000 - 0:59:27.120000::or anything.
0:59:27.120000 - 0:59:31.120000::I'm just like, you know that I'm very connected in many different industries and don't
0:59:31.120000 - 0:59:33.120000::underestimate me, man.
0:59:33.120000 - 0:59:34.120000::Everybody.

0:59:42.960000 - 0:59:51.280000::Well, well, sorry, I'm, I'm, you're going to, you're going to say that you know somebody
0:59:51.280000 - 0:59:52.760000::in the retirement community?
0:59:52.760000 - 0:59:57.080000::No, I just know somebody who's very wealthy in that, in that sector, right?
0:59:57.080000 - 0:59:59.280000::And he's making a lot of money.
0:59:59.280000 - 1:00:00.040000::He's emerging from debt.

1:00:00 - 1:00:04.400000::He's a merchant of death and not but an agent of chaos
1:00:07.800000 - 1:00:11.880000::Rejuvenation and get into what it gave us joy. Yeah, Rejuvenation can mean a lot of different.
1:00:16.600000 - 1:00:21.920000::Okay, so we need here's what's up. All right. Yeah
1:00:22.680000 - 1:00:29.960000::Here's what's up. Here's what's up. So you need to just take some time for yourself. I know everyone who's this podcast is going so fucking
1:00:30 - 1:00:34.080000::hard that can barely keep their head above water and
1:00:34.880000 - 1:00:40.840000::You just need to get some time to yourself because we know how fucking hard you're grinding right now. You're probably grinding right at a wall
1:00:40.840000 - 1:00:48.240000::Listen to this right at this very second. Mm-hmm. And can I say your mom might not see you doing this your dad might not see you
1:00:48.240000 - 1:00:52.400000::Your partners your friends are not even seeing what you're fucking doing. We know you're tired
1:00:52.880000 - 1:00:58.560000::We know we you feel like all your efforts haven't done shit for you and so far they haven't on
1:00:59.120000 - 1:01:00.480000::On paper
1:01:00.480000 - 1:01:04.520000::But deep down it's fucking the the clock is winding up the fucking
1:01:05.120000 - 1:01:10.480000::The the you know the pitch is being thrown the hit is winding up with the baseball bat
1:01:10.480000 - 1:01:13.440000::So we see you even if everybody else in your life thinks you're pathetic
1:01:13.440000 - 1:01:19.160000::Everybody thinks it's time for you to hang it up. They do which they do and that's actually a bonus for your ass
1:01:22 - 1:01:24::So
1:01:24 - 1:01:26::Anyway
1:01:28.880000 - 1:01:30.880000::That delivery was great
1:01:31.360000 - 1:01:36.240000::So just just take some time to yourself and we know that
1:01:36.720000 - 1:01:41.840000::Mm-hmm having that rejuvenation period is important to whatever you gotta do and don't do it in crazy
1:01:42.240000 - 1:01:46.800000::Just don't do anything crazy and if you do get it on video hashtag joy tag

1:05:00 - 1:05:06.320000::Arizona. I felt a real connection with that city. I hadn't heard great things about it. And I got
1:05:06.320000 - 1:05:11.680000::there into the giant Dust Bowl and basically it's a city that's not supposed to be habitable by
1:05:11.680000 - 1:05:17.040000::humans. There is mist everywhere on the sidewalks because they got the mistors going because it's too
1:05:17.040000 - 1:05:26.240000::hot to be alive there. I got on one of them scooter. It's basically like this amazing world. I told you
1:05:26.400000 - 1:05:31.520000::we were in a self-driving car. I got on a lime scooter and I biked into a fucking cactus.
