0:00:20.880000 - 0:00:24::Starting off the podcast with some Zwick,
0:00:24 - 0:00:31.280000::Zyloj's, Morkny, Diaz, some Polish water that I bought.
0:00:31.280000 - 0:00:38::I went to a Polish bakery and I saw they had these fucking $15 for all these huge ass bottles of water.
0:00:38 - 0:00:42.720000::Eric, stop trying to play around like everything's cool, everything's all right right now.
0:00:43.360000 - 0:00:47.520000::This is, let's just get in, you're you're you're avoidant right now.
0:00:49.600000 - 0:00:52.800000::This yeah, let's just go in, let's just go in right now.
0:00:52.800000 - 0:00:58.240000::It's the you all three of us are at rock bottom states.
0:00:59.600000 - 0:01:02.240000::Let me let me let me propose it back to zero.
0:01:02.240000 - 0:01:03.040000::Oh god.
0:01:03.040000 - 0:01:08.720000::If I may, if I may, you if you listen to this podcast, there's probably been a lot of points where we
0:01:08.720000 - 0:01:14.960000::thought we hit rock bottom, right, but as with the earth, what happens is you think you're at the
0:01:14.960000 - 0:01:20.640000::bottom and then you reach the mantle and then you reach the crust and then you reach the
0:01:20.640000 - 0:01:21.920000::fucking molten core.
0:01:21.920000 - 0:01:25.920000::The molten core, but there's more between that where I don't think we're at the core yet, but
0:01:26.400000 - 0:01:29.600000::what's interesting about rock bottom is sometimes you can keep digging.
0:01:30.720000 - 0:01:33.040000::They should call it core, get into the core.
0:01:33.040000 - 0:01:34.080000::That's true.
0:01:34.080000 - 0:01:38.400000::It shouldn't be called rock bottom because rock bottom, that's just the bait.
0:01:38.400000 - 0:01:41.360000::That's not as deep as the rest of the earth.
0:01:41.360000 - 0:01:46.960000::Well, remember how spun Bob lives in bikini bottom and remember when he takes the bus to
0:01:46.960000 - 0:01:47.680000::rock bottom.
0:01:48.640000 - 0:01:49.200000::Yeah.
0:01:49.200000 - 0:01:52.960000::And all the fish are fucking different down there because they need to be evolved.
0:01:52.960000 - 0:01:56.560000::So there's all these glowing fish and it's fucking twilight zone down there for sponge
0:01:56.560000 - 0:01:57.200000::about Bob.
0:01:57.200000 - 0:01:57.680000::It's hell.
0:01:58.640000 - 0:02:04.160000::And then he goes back to bikini bottom with a whole new sense of just sort of like appreciation
0:02:04.160000 - 0:02:05.520000::and gratitude for what he has.
0:02:06.160000 - 0:02:08.640000::But essentially we are in that episode right now.
0:02:08.640000 - 0:02:10.960000::But remember he thinks he's being chased.
0:02:10.960000 - 0:02:13.840000::I think that's part of the episode where he thinks he's in danger.
0:02:13.840000 - 0:02:14.240000::Yeah.
0:02:14.240000 - 0:02:19.680000::And the person goes, you left your bus pass or something.
0:02:19.680000 - 0:02:20.160000::I can't remember.
0:02:20.880000 - 0:02:22.160000::I can't believe you remember that.
0:02:22.160000 - 0:02:23.760000::I'm that's bringing back some of the new.
0:02:23.760000 - 0:02:24.960000::I don't remember.
0:02:24.960000 - 0:02:29.360000::I remember spun Bob so well because that's when I stopped watching television.
0:02:30.480000 - 0:02:36.320000::I watched all fresh print episodes, all of the George Lopez anything on Nickat night.
0:02:36.320000 - 0:02:38.800000::Any children's programming after school.
0:02:39.360000 - 0:02:41.280000::He doesn't want me, man.
0:02:41.280000 - 0:02:43.440000::What does he love me, man?
0:02:43.600000 - 0:02:45.040000::He won't be, man.
0:02:47.840000 - 0:02:50.320000::I think I really was showing people that video,
0:02:50.320000 - 0:02:54.240000::freshman year of college being like, you're not going to expect to cry at French

0:02:59.600000 - 0:03:01.600000::Doesn't Carlton get shot?
0:03:02.640000 - 0:03:03.760000::Oh my god.
0:03:03.760000 - 0:03:05.920000::Carlton gets shot in fresh prints.
0:03:06.880000 - 0:03:07.120000::Yeah.
0:03:08 - 0:03:08.400000::Really?
0:03:08.400000 - 0:03:10.960000::I'm remembering it wrong, but I'm pretty sure he gets shot by Robert.
0:03:11.840000 - 0:03:12.880000::By a robber.
0:03:12.880000 - 0:03:13.520000::A burglar.

0:03:52 - 0:03:54.240000::I mean, that's a way of like sealing something.
0:03:54.240000 - 0:03:55.760000::I think that's a medical word at all.
0:03:56.320000 - 0:03:57.440000::No, it's a word, right?

0:10:11.840000 - 0:10:17.200000::So I sent a similar thing that's like, look, let's get a one. Let's get a single episode arc
0:10:17.760000 - 0:10:24.160000::animated adaptation of Aladdin essentially. That's like this one episode animated in the bear where
0:10:24.160000 - 0:10:28.880000::it's like, this is breaking the form. This is emotional and yet it's for kids. Yeah. Where the three of us
0:10:29.360000 - 0:10:33.440000::are like in the desert and we get caught stealing some bread or something or maybe framed for it
0:10:34.160000 - 0:10:40.160000::and then go on a journey. I don't remember what Aladdin it fully is about but I know it's timeless
0:10:41.440000 - 0:10:46.320000::and I know it would work in that universe because it's human. Right. It would be the
0:10:47.360000 - 0:10:54.240000::so one, it would be incredible if we were if we were to be a larger role and yes, we would take
0:10:54.240000 - 0:10:58.880000::that offer instantly even though we have a lot of different other projects and things going
0:10:58.880000 - 0:11:07.040000::on this next year, especially in 2024. But please stop the death threats. The message
0:11:07.040000 - 0:11:11.520000::it hurts us more than it helps us. The stars and saying, if you don't get the fucking joy
0:11:11.520000 - 0:11:16.560000::tacticians on there, write the fuck now. I'm gonna fucking and I don't want to finish that sentence,
0:11:16.560000 - 0:11:21.760000::but you know who you are who's who's saying that. So we just don't condone that type of behavior.
0:11:21.760000 - 0:11:27.200000::We do not we we we quite frankly we don't want you listening to the podcast if you're someone
0:11:27.200000 - 0:11:32.560000::like that. But we do but on the flip side, I do want to say I appreciate the sentiment and I
0:11:32.560000 - 0:11:37.360000::appreciate the fans really sticking up for us like that because that because if we get a whole
0:11:37.360000 - 0:11:44.160000::movement of people like if ever if look, if we had 10,000 people sending sort of threats to
0:11:44.160000 - 0:11:50.320000::FX networks demanding that they would have to do something. Right. Because that's 10,000 eyeballs
0:11:50.320000 - 0:11:54.240000::that I want to see more of us. No, it's 20,000 eyeballs because everybody has two eyes. Well,
0:11:54.240000 - 0:11:57.280000::don't fucking say that because you don't know how I'm gonna have a brother. I'm gonna be right.
0:11:57.280000 - 0:12:02.640000::My bad, my bad, my bad. Crenshaw. But and I'll say I'm damn near condemn I'm damn near condemning
0:12:02.640000 - 0:12:07.200000::that type of behavior. I won't condemn it because I appreciate the love that it stems from. But I'm
0:12:07.200000 - 0:12:13.520000::standing back and standing by and I'll say I'm ready to move on like we played that character
0:12:13.680000 - 0:12:21.840000::for whatever you know, right. I'm like I was in that skin. I loved it. I love being a part of it.
0:12:21.840000 - 0:12:26.480000::And now I'm just ready to do new things. I want to do more dramatic. I want to do even more
0:12:26.480000 - 0:12:35.360000::comedic slapstick. I want to do Chinese films where I. I want to do some government related stuff.
0:12:35.360000 - 0:12:41.120000::Please. Maybe not a commercial for the government, but speaking of government, I do want to call
0:12:41.120000 - 0:12:47.040000::out. I don't know much about Azerbaijan. I'm politically, you know, Eric, be careful here.
0:12:47.040000 - 0:12:52.320000::No, someone commented that Azerbaijan government is fascist and I didn't know that and we keep jokingly
0:12:52.320000 - 0:12:58.480000::saying Azerbaijan is awesome. If you're a fascist state, you are not welcome in my fucking house.
0:12:59.520000 - 0:13:07.440000::For North fucking Korea, I'm rocking with that person and I want to go. Why would you burn his
0:13:08.080000 - 0:13:17.360000::to everybody that I don't know if I want to say this to everybody. Can we stop attacking politicians
0:13:17.360000 - 0:13:22.160000::for their political views because you don't know for going to run into them, right.
0:13:23.840000 - 0:13:30.160000::You guys know everybody's shitting on Joe Manchin. Remember him. Yeah, of course. He has a boat,
0:13:30.160000 - 0:13:37.120000::but he has a boat. And what if one day you're messing up an opportunity for you to go hang out
0:13:37.120000 - 0:13:43.040000::on a boat because you're pissed off about the price of drugs or some overdoses happening in your
0:13:43.040000 - 0:13:49.280000::neck of the woods. I don't think we should have politicians anymore. I don't think humans can
0:13:49.280000 - 0:13:54.400000::self-govern. I think we've proved that time and time again that we're not up to the task and it's
0:13:54.400000 - 0:14:02.320000::time for overlords to step in, step up, set back, set up, come back, robot style and make humanity
0:14:02.720000 - 0:14:12.240000::basically have no free will. I agree. That's what we're already doing. You don't realize that.
0:14:12.240000 - 0:14:22.160000::We are fucking batter. This is what I think we need. What we need to we need to put a raise a benevolent
0:14:22.640000 - 0:14:30.240000::programmer child. Okay. And we need to put billions of dollars into creating the most morally
0:14:30.240000 - 0:14:37.200000::sound benevolent child. Okay. And they have the best child that ever. They're raised with the
0:14:37.200000 - 0:14:43.200000::best ethics and morals and we teach them all these coding language and AI programming. They're the
0:14:43.200000 - 0:14:49.680000::they have the genetics to be the best programmer on the planet. And then when they're you know 45
0:14:49.680000 - 0:14:55.680000::years old, we kind of keep them in a bubble. Okay. When they're 45 years old, we have them designed
0:14:55.680000 - 0:15:00::a AI system that is the perfect governance for humanity.

0:15:00 - 0:15:04.400000::and they are, it's called the benevolent code, all right?
0:15:04.400000 - 0:15:07.880000::And this code is the most sound best.
0:15:07.880000 - 0:15:09.600000::There's no corruption in it.
0:15:09.600000 - 0:15:12.520000::It was from a pure soul that created it
0:15:12.520000 - 0:15:14.680000::that has no game in the system.
0:15:14.680000 - 0:15:18.200000::They've been genetic, they have no corruption inside of them.
0:15:18.200000 - 0:15:20.120000::They have all goodwill and good energy.
0:15:20.120000 - 0:15:23.040000::And they create this benevolent government system
0:15:23.040000 - 0:15:27.960000::that takes over, martial law takes away the guns,
0:15:27.960000 - 0:15:29.640000::makes everybody, you know.
0:15:29.640000 - 0:15:31.440000::With martial law.
0:15:31.440000 - 0:15:33.760000::Yes, there is some negative side effects to it,
0:15:33.760000 - 0:15:36.280000::but it's just, but you need to go through that too.
0:15:36.280000 - 0:15:41.240000::There's no sickness, the good sick will be pleasantly eliminated.
0:15:41.240000 - 0:15:42.240000::Oh yeah.
0:15:42.240000 - 0:15:44.240000::And the way that they're eliminated is through pure ecstasy
0:15:44.240000 - 0:15:47.400000::so they get to experience joy that others can't.
0:15:47.400000 - 0:15:50.040000::So how are we gonna make this, are we gonna smash all our
0:15:50.040000 - 0:15:51.800000::berms together?
0:15:51.800000 - 0:15:55.800000::Well, and then into a one mega sperm, into one fucking long.
0:15:55.800000 - 0:15:57.440000::You're saying everybody in the world.
0:15:57.440000 - 0:15:59.440000::Long sperm.
0:15:59.440000 - 0:16:05.200000::And then who is there a surrogate is who does?
0:16:05.200000 - 0:16:06.400000::Okay, how about this?
0:16:06.400000 - 0:16:07.400000::Who's the mother?
0:16:07.400000 - 0:16:09.040000::You guys know all those volcano,
0:16:09.040000 - 0:16:11::volcanic eruptions about to go down in Iceland?
0:16:11 - 0:16:12.200000::I know, I know.
0:16:12.200000 - 0:16:17.560000::What if everybody in the world goes and busts a nut in that volcano?
0:16:17.560000 - 0:16:19.800000::And I don't know what the fuck that would do.
0:16:19.800000 - 0:16:20.760000::I don't know what it would do.
0:16:20.760000 - 0:16:24.200000::That's the beginning of the world started kind of like that.
0:16:24.200000 - 0:16:26.760000::But my best attempt at experimenting with people
0:16:26.760000 - 0:16:29.800000::who are doing back in the day, what if I know the volcano?
0:16:29.800000 - 0:16:34.640000::What if I fucking do something dirty to this tree?
0:16:34.640000 - 0:16:37.880000::What if I, because they had no mechanical instruments.
0:16:37.880000 - 0:16:40.680000::So experiments were a lot more natural like that.
0:16:40.680000 - 0:16:43::Can you imagine sitting on the,
0:16:43 - 0:16:48.440000::you're on the dome of a volcano and every male that you've ever
0:16:48.440000 - 0:16:50.880000::met in your life is standing in the,
0:16:50.880000 - 0:16:54.200000::around the circle all jacking up in you just want to be there.
0:16:54.200000 - 0:16:55.960000::And this song is playing that.
0:16:55.960000 - 0:17:00.960000::Everything, everything.
0:17:00.960000 - 0:17:02.120000::What the fuck is that?
0:17:02.120000 - 0:17:03.120000::It's like a blasting.
0:17:03.120000 - 0:17:04.360000::Everybody's that.
0:17:04.360000 - 0:17:04.880000::What song is that?
0:17:04.880000 - 0:17:06.080000::And it has to be synced.
0:17:06.080000 - 0:17:07.640000::What song is that?
0:17:07.640000 - 0:17:08.480000::That's that radio.
0:17:08.480000 - 0:17:11.600000::Well, that's called Everything in the Trice Place
0:17:11.600000 - 0:17:17.120000::by Radiohead off of Kid A, one of their seminal rock
0:17:17.120000 - 0:17:22.240000::experimental rock records to come out of the 20th,
0:17:22.240000 - 0:17:23.720000::first century, I believe.
0:17:23.720000 - 0:17:24.840000::All right, sketch.
0:17:24.840000 - 0:17:28.760000::I got a sketch kind of the idea for Eric and Eric.
0:17:28.760000 - 0:17:29.600000::Like a song.
0:17:29.600000 - 0:17:33.160000::Everybody's syncing up the, they're getting going.
0:17:33.160000 - 0:17:35.280000::Screaming is getting so close.
0:17:35.280000 - 0:17:37.280000::Yeah.
0:17:37.280000 - 0:17:39.520000::Eric, what?
0:17:39.520000 - 0:17:40.440000::What?
0:17:40.440000 - 0:17:42.720000::That I never met.
0:17:42.720000 - 0:17:45::Are we not allowed to play music like that on the, um?
0:17:45 - 0:17:45.600000::No, we can't.
0:17:45.600000 - 0:17:46.960000::I was going to say there's a button called
0:17:46.960000 - 0:17:50.400000::Music Original Sound for musicians on the top left of the Zoom.
0:17:50.400000 - 0:17:53.160000::Oh, if you click it, we can hear.
0:17:53.160000 - 0:17:54.400000::Oh, then you can hear that.
0:17:54.400000 - 0:17:55.600000::I didn't even need to because I've heard.
0:17:55.600000 - 0:17:57.520000::So you didn't even hear it at times.
0:17:57.520000 - 0:17:59.640000::I was just blasting that in the mic.
0:17:59.640000 - 0:18:01.280000::Well, I'm missing those.
0:18:01.280000 - 0:18:02.280000::I'm missing them.
0:18:02.280000 - 0:18:04.640000::Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
0:18:04.640000 - 0:18:07.680000::I saw Radiohead live in high school.
0:18:07.680000 - 0:18:08.520000::Who'd you go with, man?
0:18:08.520000 - 0:18:10.280000::Did you have any friends with you or no?
0:18:10.280000 - 0:18:11.680000::You know I don't have friends, man.
0:18:11.680000 - 0:18:13::Why did you ask that?
0:18:13 - 0:18:14.960000::Why was that the first question you had to ask?
0:18:14.960000 - 0:18:15.800000::I didn't.
0:18:17.880000 - 0:18:19.440000::So nervous.
0:18:19.440000 - 0:18:20.600000::Well, I did have friends.
0:18:20.600000 - 0:18:22.960000::And I went to Chicago and I went to La La Paloza.
0:18:22.960000 - 0:18:24.560000::And who did I see at that festival?
0:18:24.560000 - 0:18:27.160000::This is the greatest lineup that's ever been created
0:18:27.160000 - 0:18:28.880000::here of all time.
0:18:28.880000 - 0:18:29.880000::Cutty.
0:18:29.880000 - 0:18:31.640000::Radiohead was there.
0:18:31.640000 - 0:18:32.920000::Who else was there?
0:18:32.920000 - 0:18:34.560000::Rage against the machine.
0:18:34.560000 - 0:18:39.520000::You reunited for the first time in 20 years or something.
0:18:39.520000 - 0:18:40.280000::Wow.
0:18:40.280000 - 0:18:41.440000::Who else was there?
0:18:41.440000 - 0:18:42.640000::Girl talk.
0:18:42.640000 - 0:18:43.960000::Yeah, I know you like that.
0:18:43.960000 - 0:18:45.760000::Oh, shit.
0:18:45.760000 - 0:18:48.320000::Who else was there?
0:18:48.320000 - 0:18:50.680000::Wilco, of course, Chicago legends.
0:18:50.680000 - 0:18:52.920000::They're there every year, though.
0:18:52.920000 - 0:18:53.760000::Our local.
0:18:53.760000 - 0:18:54.920000::Our local.
0:18:54.920000 - 0:18:58.080000::Kanye West was there.
0:18:58.080000 - 0:18:59.080000::Graduation.
0:18:59.080000 - 0:19:00.560000::You who shall not be.
0:19:00.560000 - 0:19:07.800000::And I'm going to say, and I wonder if you know what it means.
0:19:07.800000 - 0:19:09.080000::All that era of Kanye.
0:19:09.080000 - 0:19:09.680000::I saw him.
0:19:09.680000 - 0:19:11.120000::Why, dude.
0:19:11.120000 - 0:19:13.200000::And you guys immediately want to see me hop on sort
0:19:13.200000 - 0:19:14.680000::of a cover of that.
0:19:14.680000 - 0:19:18.200000::Have you guys been seeing North's TikToks
0:19:18.200000 - 0:19:19.840000::that she's making with Ms. Kim?
0:19:19.840000 - 0:19:22.600000::I've been laughing at the one with the Bayer and then.
0:19:22.600000 - 0:19:24.120000::Yeah.
0:19:24.120000 - 0:19:25.360000::She.
0:19:25.360000 - 0:19:28.680000::Man, oh, the place is she'll go.
0:19:28.680000 - 0:19:30.480000::I'm just saying that she's going to be a creative force
0:19:30.480000 - 0:19:32.840000::to be reckoned with.
0:19:32.840000 - 0:19:35.040000::There's Jen Alpha is experimenting
0:19:35.040000 - 0:19:38.480000::with form in a way that blows me mind.
0:19:38.480000 - 0:19:41.640000::I can't imagine having, if I had that access to those type
0:19:41.640000 - 0:19:43.400000::of tools and that type of video editing software
0:19:43.400000 - 0:19:45.800000::when I was 10, I would not be chatting on Zoom
0:19:45.800000 - 0:19:47.520000::with you fools right now.
0:19:47.520000 - 0:19:49.280000::I'd be penthouseed up.
0:19:49.280000 - 0:19:52.520000::I'll fucking massage down.

0:35:22.200000 - 0:35:23.760000::Let's see, I had a cocktail at home.
0:35:23.760000 - 0:35:26.360000::I had a beer with dinner with Jack.
0:35:26.360000 - 0:35:29::We bought a little bottle of Patron, okay?
0:35:29 - 0:35:31.840000::A little baby bottle.
0:35:31.840000 - 0:35:36.640000::Had probably two little glasses of that.
0:35:36.640000 - 0:35:41.160000::And then had tequila soda at the party.
0:35:41.160000 - 0:35:46.360000::So that's not that crazy, is it?
0:35:46.360000 - 0:35:49.120000::No, I was just wondering how much you like,
0:35:49.120000 - 0:35:50.920000::if you were like hungover or...
0:35:50.920000 - 0:35:53.240000::I'm not really hungover, but I am emptied out.
0:35:53.240000 - 0:35:55.160000::I'm shelled out, you know what I mean?
0:35:55.160000 - 0:35:58.560000::You're gonna pay, the next couple days you're gonna be rough for you.
0:35:58.600000 - 0:36:00.040000::I know I'm gonna punish myself with the jam.
0:36:00.040000 - 0:36:02.880000::I have no fucking option at this point.
0:36:02.880000 - 0:36:06.920000::Okay, Jack, what's your fucking height, weight,
0:36:06.920000 - 0:36:09.480000::fucking and blood pressure?
0:36:10.480000 - 0:36:12.440000::I weigh six...
0:36:12.440000 - 0:36:14.680000::No way, I am 65.
0:36:14.680000 - 0:36:18.400000::My weight is 217 pounds.
0:36:18.400000 - 0:36:23.400000::And my blood pressure is 220 last time I was at the doctor.
0:36:23.720000 - 0:36:25.040000::At the doctor.
0:36:26.720000 - 0:36:28.280000::It's not 217 as well.
0:36:29.320000 - 0:36:30.160000::Yeah, why?
0:36:30.160000 - 0:36:33.960000::Because we are seeing what weight does to a human body at different heights.
0:36:35.120000 - 0:36:36.200000::This is a good case study.
0:36:36.200000 - 0:36:37.520000::That's quite interesting.
0:36:38.560000 - 0:36:45.760000::Because it's almost like, what could you relate that to?
0:36:45.760000 - 0:36:48.360000::Putting water in two different sized cups?
0:36:48.360000 - 0:36:49.840000::Yeah.
0:36:49.840000 - 0:36:50.840000::Wow.
0:36:50.840000 - 0:36:51.960000::Hmm.
0:36:51.960000 - 0:36:52.800000::Wow.
0:36:52.800000 - 0:36:55.840000::Last night, am I looking different these days?
0:36:55.840000 - 0:36:59.240000::Like, I felt like I'm not in a good or bad way, not like am I sexy,
0:36:59.240000 - 0:37:02.520000::but I looked at myself and thought, what is going on with me?
0:37:02.520000 - 0:37:03.600000::I'm wearing that shirt.
0:37:03.600000 - 0:37:06.720000::I just got those wide, sticky pants.
0:37:06.720000 - 0:37:09.680000::And I kind of felt like a construction guy.
0:37:09.680000 - 0:37:10.840000::You look great, Eric.
0:37:10.840000 - 0:37:12.800000::You look incredible, dude.
0:37:12.800000 - 0:37:16.080000::I can't tell you how much I like looking at your face and body
0:37:16.080000 - 0:37:17.360000::in a non-sexual way.
0:37:17.360000 - 0:37:20.120000::And just enough, it brings a warmth.
0:37:20.120000 - 0:37:21.040000::Does anyone get this?
0:37:21.040000 - 0:37:23.920000::I feel, I just really feel this way.
0:37:23.920000 - 0:37:26.480000::Does it remind me of your own?
0:37:26.480000 - 0:37:29.280000::I was looking at my body in the mirror the gym day other day.
0:37:29.280000 - 0:37:34.080000::And maybe it was a short size wearing, but it looks like someone who played in indoor soccer
0:37:34.080000 - 0:37:37::when they were in their 20s and they got fucking some injury.
0:37:37 - 0:37:40.600000::And now they're coaching from the sidelines and they put a little poundage on.
0:37:40.600000 - 0:37:44.520000::And then I like to drink the beer, but they still are slightly active.
0:37:44.520000 - 0:37:45.200000::Yeah.
0:37:45.200000 - 0:37:47.760000::So lately active.
0:37:47.760000 - 0:37:48.680000::Yeah, yeah.
0:37:48.680000 - 0:37:52.560000::Yeah, that's the sweet spot.
0:37:52.560000 - 0:37:56.560000::Yeah, I was looking at some drips recently.
0:37:56.560000 - 0:37:59.920000::I feel like I have not, okay.
0:37:59.920000 - 0:38:04.200000::I kind of have closed the drip chapter, you know.
0:38:04.200000 - 0:38:07.160000::I got my AC shoes.
0:38:07.160000 - 0:38:08.440000::Open it up.
0:38:08.440000 - 0:38:09.280000::The drip chapter.
0:38:09.280000 - 0:38:12.720000::And I haven't even thought about, I go in these drip phases where I'm like looking at
0:38:12.720000 - 0:38:16.080000::eBay all the time and like, oh, I need some new shit.
0:38:16.080000 - 0:38:17.600000::And then that totally went away.
0:38:17.600000 - 0:38:18.600000::Like I'm not even kidding you.
0:38:18.600000 - 0:38:22.720000::I got these shoes and I was like, I don't even want anything at all.
0:38:22.720000 - 0:38:24.080000::Like no, there's no clothes.
0:38:24.080000 - 0:38:29.960000::Like I'm not looking at any fucking essence, whatever, dot com.
0:38:29.960000 - 0:38:38.920000::But I opened up eBay and I was, I found myself looking at sort of soccer jerseys and stuff
0:38:38.920000 - 0:38:39.920000::like that.
0:38:39.920000 - 0:38:45.320000::And kind of like a deed is like like active pillows type of shit.
0:38:45.320000 - 0:38:47.320000::And I was like, footy.
0:38:48.160000 - 0:38:49.160000::I don't know.
0:38:49.160000 - 0:38:54.380000::I just like that kind of look, even though I've, I have played soccer before, but in a wreck
0:38:54.380000 - 0:38:58.560000::league in college, but I was not good.
0:38:58.560000 - 0:39:02.960000::But I was like, I kind of like this vibe of just wearing the adidas sort of, you know,
0:39:02.960000 - 0:39:09::like a long sleeve polo adidas with the stripes going down the side.
0:39:09 - 0:39:11::I really could see your ass on the side.
0:39:11 - 0:39:15.720000::You know, all them soccer coaches or with the call football coaches on the side of the
0:39:15.720000 - 0:39:18.360000::sidelines and they're always getting pissed in Europe.
0:39:18.360000 - 0:39:19.360000::Oh, yeah.
0:39:19.360000 - 0:39:20.360000::Oh, God.
0:39:20.360000 - 0:39:23.320000::And people are making fucking fan cams of them doing shit.
0:39:23.320000 - 0:39:25.200000::I could see your ass out there, man.
0:39:25.200000 - 0:39:30.560000::It's because I would be the most violent coach ever.
0:39:30.560000 - 0:39:34.440000::And we would get, we would win some championships, the best believe.
0:39:34.440000 - 0:39:40::I want to boss around some fucking college age, fucking athletes so badly.
0:39:40 - 0:39:45.560000::And see, you know, coaches, I think this is a good idea.
0:39:45.560000 - 0:39:50.080000::It should be allowed fully on the court, fully in the field.
0:39:50.080000 - 0:39:52.680000::Like if you're a basketball coach, don't touch anybody.
0:39:52.680000 - 0:39:53.840000::Don't touch the ball or nothing.
0:39:53.840000 - 0:39:56.880000::Don't get in the way, but you should be able to be running in the mix.
0:39:56.880000 - 0:39:57.880000::Oh, yeah.
0:39:57.880000 - 0:39:58.880000::Grab that shit.
0:39:58.880000 - 0:39:59.880000::No.
0:39:59.880000 - 0:40:00::Oh, oh, oh, oh.

0:40:00 - 0:40:04.960000::You should be able to get people's ears like you should fully be sweating on the court
0:40:05.120000 - 0:40:10.040000::But that's part of being a coach is like you have that third eye where you know how to be out of the way

0:54:50.220000 - 0:54:54.780000::That show is bussin and I've been thinking about it a lot ever since and
0:54:56.660000 - 0:55:00.060000::Yeah, it's on showtime right now. It's what they're releasing

0:55:00 - 0:55:03.360000::it week by week, right? Yeah, but we've all seen the first three.
0:55:03.360000 - 0:55:08.680000::I'm like, I'm like, so I want to watch the rest of the season so badly because we only saw
0:55:08.680000 - 0:55:13.840000::the first. So I got to wait like a month basically to get to the fourth episode.
0:55:13.840000 - 0:55:18.040000::But let me put it like this. When we saw it, I thought it was just going to be, I thought
0:55:18.040000 - 0:55:23.960000::they were like 20 minute episodes and I kind of had to pee at the beginning of it. And
0:55:23.960000 - 0:55:26.920000::we sat down and they're like, we're pleased to announce we're going to be showing the first
0:55:26.920000 - 0:55:31.880000::three episodes coming to find out these are about 45 minute episodes. So my initial reaction
0:55:31.880000 - 0:55:35.880000::was, that's a long time to be watching all this, even though this guy knows it's going
0:55:35.880000 - 0:55:41.280000::to be amazing. Well, by the end, I would have watched a fucking another no joke.
0:55:41.280000 - 0:55:47.200000::Exactly. I was like, man, I want to like, binge the rest of this shit like it. Yeah.
0:55:47.200000 - 0:55:52.240000::There's nothing like it. There's nothing like it on TV. Yeah. It's great. I want to
0:55:52.240000 - 0:55:56.640000::shout out the gold bachelor's plus. What's that? It's on paramount. It's on two different
0:55:56.640000 - 0:56:00.400000::streaming platforms. Paramount plus and showtime because you know, everything has like,
0:56:00.400000 - 0:56:06.240000::it's like, you can watch showtime on fucking. Apparently, who I love it. It works. It's
0:56:06.240000 - 0:56:12.440000::weird. But we need to fix streaming now. By the way, we still have a free paramount
0:56:12.440000 - 0:56:16.280000::plus subscription. Jack, did you know that if you can, if you log into it? Oh, really?

0:56:55.640000 - 0:57:02.520000::watched the bachelor, but this show got me fucking crying. Not every episode, but this last
0:57:02.520000 - 0:57:07.960000::episode. It was like, because these people back to the elderly theme, elderly people just
0:57:07.960000 - 0:57:14.680000::want love, man. And it's they they're discarded by our society in this youth culture. And
0:57:14.680000 - 0:57:18::these people are made to feel like they are not worthy. And yet they are some of the most
0:57:18 - 0:57:22.520000::beautiful people on the planet. And so to all these women that are getting discarded by
0:57:22.520000 - 0:57:26.440000::Gary, because he has to do this. That's the rule of the game is I don't know if you guys
0:57:26.440000 - 0:57:32.960000::know this every episode. One of the women contestants is eliminated. And their heart is broken.
0:57:32.960000 - 0:57:39.120000::But I hope for them that they find love outside of the show because all those women deserve
0:57:39.120000 - 0:57:46.720000::the world. I like the variations that they're doing on the bachelor format. And by the way,
0:57:46.720000 - 0:57:50.680000::when are they going to have a gay bachelor? You know, have they? Yeah. Bachelor nation
0:57:50.680000 - 0:57:55.920000::is not ready. Or no, a bachelor nation is ready. They are so ready. Are you serious? I
