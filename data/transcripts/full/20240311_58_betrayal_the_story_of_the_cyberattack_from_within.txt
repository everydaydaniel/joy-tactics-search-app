0:00:00 - 0:00:07.160000::You know what the fucking pet peeve of mine is when actors are showing that they are closer
0:00:07.160000 - 0:00:10.640000::with a famous person by calling them a shortened version of the name.
0:00:10.640000 - 0:00:12.640000::Oh, Caprio.
0:00:12.640000 - 0:00:13.640000::Yeah, Cap.
0:00:13.640000 - 0:00:14.640000::Caprio.
0:00:14.640000 - 0:00:15.640000::What's the cap?
0:00:15.640000 - 0:00:17.840000::Welcome to Joy Tactics.
0:00:17.840000 - 0:00:22.560000::The podcast dedicated to all things joyful, joyous, and meeting as many celebrities as
0:00:22.560000 - 0:00:24.680000::humanly possible.
0:00:24.680000 - 0:00:28.840000::Insted by Eric Rahel, Nate Verodie, and Jack Fencingham.
0:00:28.840000 - 0:00:29.840000::Enjoy.
0:00:29.840000 - 0:00:30.840000::All right.
0:00:30.840000 - 0:00:36.120000::Well, we have some, we have some terrible, terrible news to share.
0:00:36.120000 - 0:00:41.440000::Something disturbing happened that has frankly been keeping me from getting a full nights
0:00:41.440000 - 0:00:43.360000::rest.
0:00:43.360000 - 0:00:44.360000::Which is tough.
0:00:44.360000 - 0:00:49.480000::Which is tough because I need ten hours.
0:00:49.480000 - 0:00:51::But this is no laughing matter.
0:00:51 - 0:00:53.880000::This is extremely serious.
0:00:53.880000 - 0:01:00.280000::And well, something, I should say this first off, we definitely expected something like
0:01:00.280000 - 0:01:01.280000::this to happen.
0:01:01.280000 - 0:01:05.080000::And it's surprising that it hasn't happened earlier.
0:01:05.080000 - 0:01:09.760000::We have been with our critiques of the current administration and critiques of the Russian
0:01:09.760000 - 0:01:11.160000::administration and cartels.
0:01:11.160000 - 0:01:12.160000::Right.
0:01:12.160000 - 0:01:13.880000::We knew something was coming.
0:01:13.880000 - 0:01:18.160000::We have been the victims.
0:01:18.160000 - 0:01:20.960000::And I don't like using that word, but I'm going to use it.
0:01:20.960000 - 0:01:23.480000::We have been the victims of a cyber attack.
0:01:23.480000 - 0:01:26.440000::The TARGET, the joy tactics Instagram account, targets.
0:01:26.440000 - 0:01:28.160000::I should say targets more.
0:01:28.160000 - 0:01:33.640000::We have been the targeted by cyber terrorism.
0:01:33.640000 - 0:01:34.640000::Cyber bullies.
0:01:34.640000 - 0:01:38.560000::Cyber bullies, whatever you want to call it, we have been attacked by them.
0:01:38.560000 - 0:01:43::Our Instagram account has been hacked.
0:01:43 - 0:01:46.840000::And first off, how does that make you all feel?
0:01:46.840000 - 0:01:52.920000::And then we'll go into the details of what the cyber attack entailed.
0:01:52.920000 - 0:01:54.360000::Well, it's funny, right?
0:01:54.360000 - 0:01:56.960000::Because you like to think you're safe.
0:01:56.960000 - 0:02:02.900000::You like to think that people have your best interests at heart and that everybody will
0:02:02.900000 - 0:02:03.900000::play fair.
0:02:03.900000 - 0:02:06.840000::If you do your part and you live a moral life.
0:02:06.840000 - 0:02:10.720000::But then something like this happens where the rug is pulled out underneath from underneath
0:02:10.720000 - 0:02:16.800000::you and you are reminded of the nature of man, which is not evil, which is not good.
0:02:16.800000 - 0:02:20.120000::Which is just the nature of man is survival.
0:02:20.120000 - 0:02:23.880000::And this person is trying to get at us to maybe keep their shit afloat.
0:02:23.880000 - 0:02:34.320000::I don't know what their motivations were, but this certainly is rearranging my mental guts
0:02:34.320000 - 0:02:35.320000::right now.
0:02:35.320000 - 0:02:40.600000::Nate, do you want to describe the nature of the attack?
0:02:40.600000 - 0:02:44.120000::The specifics before we get into it?
0:02:44.120000 - 0:02:45.120000::Yeah.
0:02:45.120000 - 0:02:51.480000::Okay, so this happened late at night a couple of days ago.
0:02:51.480000 - 0:02:56.680000::And by the way, Eric had noticed the cyber attack and just said nothing.
0:02:56.680000 - 0:02:59.040000::Because I thought that this was an intentional.
0:02:59.040000 - 0:03:04.240000::I thought that you guys like to pull all the levers and control the how these podcasts
0:03:04.240000 - 0:03:05.240000::go.
0:03:05.240000 - 0:03:07.040000::So I was like, well, maybe this was on purpose.
0:03:07.040000 - 0:03:11.880000::And maybe this was a hilarious stunt by one of my co-authors.
0:03:11.880000 - 0:03:12.920000::Okay, well, I'll just describe it.
0:03:12.920000 - 0:03:20.120000::So I went on the Instagram account and there was just a, we only follow like three accounts
0:03:20.120000 - 0:03:21.120000::on the Instagram.
0:03:21.120000 - 0:03:22.120000::TMZ tactics.
0:03:22.120000 - 0:03:24.120000::Transcendental meditation.
0:03:24.120000 - 0:03:25.120000::Yeah.
0:03:25.120000 - 0:03:26.120000::And salsa and beer maybe.
0:03:26.120000 - 0:03:27.120000::And salsa and beer.
0:03:27.120000 - 0:03:31.160000::And what appears in the feed was not TMZ post.
0:03:31.160000 - 0:03:33.920000::It was not a transcendental meditation.
0:03:33.920000 - 0:03:35.760000::It was not a salsa and beer restaurant post.
0:03:35.760000 - 0:03:37::It was a pog.
0:03:37 - 0:03:38::It was a pog.
0:03:38.720000 - 0:03:44.640000::He just sitting in the feed in the feed, the grid feed.
0:03:44.640000 - 0:03:48.560000::And I was like, hmm, that's what, well, that's interesting.
0:03:48.560000 - 0:03:52.480000::And then I looked at the stories and all the stories are like all these like only fans
0:03:52.480000 - 0:03:55.200000::models and just baddies.
0:03:55.200000 - 0:03:56.200000::And I was like, what the hell?
0:03:56.200000 - 0:04:01::I went to our page and we're following 316 people.
0:04:01 - 0:04:04.800000::And I said, this is, and that's so not us.
0:04:04.800000 - 0:04:05.800000::We made a pact.
0:04:05.800000 - 0:04:09.800000::All three of us before we started the podcast and never look at those type of pages just
0:04:09.800000 - 0:04:14::their way to lead peer more, more lives.
0:04:14 - 0:04:20.360000::And so that, that did disturb me that want to be all broke that covenant.
0:04:20.360000 - 0:04:21.840000::But yeah, it was always me, right, Eric?
0:04:21.840000 - 0:04:26.640000::You just thought it was like I didn't suspect Jack for one second that he would have followed
0:04:26.640000 - 0:04:29.120000::300 beautiful women.
0:04:29.120000 - 0:04:30.120000::I did that.
0:04:30.120000 - 0:04:31.120000::I'm not mad at that.
0:04:31.120000 - 0:04:33.480000::I would suspect me too.
0:04:33.480000 - 0:04:37.560000::Yeah, that's what's funny, but it wasn't me.
0:04:37.560000 - 0:04:43.920000::So someone guessed our password broken to that which was actually very encrypted.
0:04:43.920000 - 0:04:48.960000::I was the one who came with the password made it exceptionally hard to crack.
0:04:48.960000 - 0:04:51.320000::So this was a professional job.
0:04:51.320000 - 0:04:55.400000::This is an ocean's 11 style break in.
0:04:55.400000 - 0:04:56.920000::Should we try to get to the bottom of it?
0:04:56.920000 - 0:04:57.920000::Should we get to the bottom of it?
0:04:57.920000 - 0:04:58.920000::Should we get to the bottom of it?
0:04:58.920000 - 0:04:59.920000::Should we get to the bottom of it?

0:05:00 - 0:05:04.360000::I suspect it's someone from a rival podcast maybe Grace Coolnchmit
0:05:04.360000 - 0:05:06::from oh I

0:08:02.460000 - 0:08:05.740000::So you're wondering how this happened right?
0:08:06.740000 - 0:08:11.540000::Yes, I was funny enough. I was watching the TV show traders very
0:08:12.060000 - 0:08:20.660000::Funny show season two Alan Cummings. I believe and I thought I'm going to sabotage
0:08:21.780000 - 0:08:26.580000::Joy tactics and see yeah figured out and it really was the perfect crime and
0:08:27.740000 - 0:08:31.660000::I have this as well on my phone recording Nate

0:09:09.780000 - 0:09:17.160000::Yeah, you don't think that ran through my head. I said you know, I bet maybe one of these fuckers is but who did you suspect more me or
0:09:17.460000 - 0:09:18.980000::Jack I
0:09:18.980000 - 0:09:22.180000::Will say my first thought was Eric
0:09:22.780000 - 0:09:29.620000::Had logged on to the joy tactics account for the first time in a year and just got on and just didn't know
0:09:29.620000 - 0:09:35.020000::He was like he thought he was getting on his like Finster something like that and it just doing what he normally does and
0:09:35.180000 - 0:09:38.380000::Following new the daily best fall accounts
0:09:39.300000 - 0:09:45.620000::So that's well that was my first thought and then I thought hmm is this some kind of a little average sort of and I was like no
0:09:45.780000 - 0:09:47.780000::This can't know because
0:09:47.980000 - 0:09:49.980000::What no way
0:09:49.980000 - 0:09:57.220000::300 accounts you and we changed our password jack because of your ass and I had to change the password and I put on a two factor
0:09:58.020000 - 0:10:00.020000::authentication on top of that

0:10:00 - 0:10:03.120000::to further protect the account from this type of behavior.
0:10:03.120000 - 0:10:04.120000::Wow.
0:10:04.120000 - 0:10:07.120000::Yeah, I was kind of weirded out by this.
0:10:07.120000 - 0:10:10.320000::Like, why was this that this is what I thought?
0:10:10.320000 - 0:10:15.320000::Somebody was some sort of like subscription people pay for
0:10:15.320000 - 0:10:17.560000::where they just get followers.
0:10:17.560000 - 0:10:19.880000::And the way they do it is they hack into other people's counts
0:10:19.880000 - 0:10:21.960000::and they follow a group of people.
0:10:21.960000 - 0:10:23.880000::And every account that they hack,
0:10:23.880000 - 0:10:26.200000::they'll follow the same people and then those people.
0:10:26.200000 - 0:10:28.280000::Sounds like an inefficient having to hack.
0:10:30.240000 - 0:10:31.240000::All the proof.
0:10:31.240000 - 0:10:32.840000::I think that does happen.
0:10:32.840000 - 0:10:34.040000::Wow.
0:10:34.040000 - 0:10:34.960000::Who knows?
0:10:34.960000 - 0:10:37.040000::And Eric, you're fucking advanced in the tech industry.
0:10:37.040000 - 0:10:38.040000::I know.
0:10:38.040000 - 0:10:41.120000::This isn't at all flare up on your.
0:10:41.120000 - 0:10:44.200000::I had suspicions that I didn't want to air publicly,
0:10:44.200000 - 0:10:48.200000::but I was getting pretty close to finding the culprit.
0:10:48.200000 - 0:10:50.560000::And I was going to punish them with death.
0:10:50.560000 - 0:10:53.640000::So I'm glad that you came out and said something off the bat
0:10:53.640000 - 0:10:54.800000::and you know, we'll do something.
0:10:54.800000 - 0:10:55.960000::You couldn't go into punishment.
0:10:55.960000 - 0:10:57.160000::What a very painful.
0:10:57.160000 - 0:10:59.160000::You heard some written area that's like,
0:10:59.320000 - 0:11:00.520000::he's back to stand right now.
0:11:00.520000 - 0:11:01.320000::Yeah, right.
0:11:01.320000 - 0:11:04.840000::I just got over trying to get a plan to get it.
0:11:04.840000 - 0:11:05.680000::It's like murder.
0:11:05.680000 - 0:11:06.720000::Seven transfers.
0:11:09 - 0:11:09.600000::I'm murder.
0:11:09.600000 - 0:11:11.080000::It's a visa.
0:11:11.080000 - 0:11:14.440000::Well, so that's got to be the new movie that we put,
0:11:14.440000 - 0:11:17.920000::which is named John Cena and make our millions.
0:11:17.920000 - 0:11:18.840000::Oh, the comedy.
0:11:18.840000 - 0:11:19.280000::Murder.
0:11:19.280000 - 0:11:20.600000::Comedy.
0:11:20.600000 - 0:11:22.560000::Yeah, that'll be amazing.
0:11:22.560000 - 0:11:27.440000::So this luckily for you, both this was all that happened
0:11:28.320000 - 0:11:32.720000::and for me as well, really, that it was just a drill.
0:11:32.720000 - 0:11:37.160000::But I think what we've seen now is how we act in moments
0:11:37.160000 - 0:11:40.640000::of crisis, how vulnerable we are to cyber attacks.
0:11:41.800000 - 0:11:43.160000::Yeah, just thankfully this wasn't real,
0:11:43.160000 - 0:11:45.680000::but next time if this really does happen,
0:11:45.680000 - 0:11:48.280000::that's, and this is why I wanted to talk about cybersecurity
0:11:48.280000 - 0:11:52.400000::today as well as the Oscars with the election you're coming up.
0:11:53.800000 - 0:11:56.400000::What can we do differently next time when something,
0:11:56.400000 - 0:11:58.480000::if something like this were to really happen,
0:11:58.480000 - 0:11:59.880000::if we were to really be compromised,
0:11:59.880000 - 0:12:01.760000::because what if they hack into the Patreon?
0:12:01.760000 - 0:12:04.960000::We have people's social security.
0:12:04.960000 - 0:12:07.360000::That's our entire living.
0:12:07.360000 - 0:12:08.360000::Exactly.
0:12:09.320000 - 0:12:11.480000::Except for every full time job.
0:12:11.480000 - 0:12:12.520000::Yeah.
0:12:12.520000 - 0:12:14.840000::Oh, yeah, by the way, everybody, guess what?
0:12:14.840000 - 0:12:16.280000::I got a job.
0:12:17.480000 - 0:12:19.080000::Y'all didn't think I could make it happen,
0:12:19.080000 - 0:12:20.360000::but I got another one.
0:12:23.120000 - 0:12:23.960000::Prove the hate.
0:12:23.960000 - 0:12:24.800000::I got clear up something.
0:12:24.800000 - 0:12:27.160000::I was editing the podcast for it,
0:12:27.160000 - 0:12:28.760000::and this really pissed me off.
0:12:28.760000 - 0:12:31.440000::Just in case people thought this is true.
0:12:31.440000 - 0:12:34.360000::Eric, you said I went to private school in one of the last.
0:12:34.360000 - 0:12:35.200000::Did I?
0:12:35.200000 - 0:12:37.720000::So as a joke, as a joke, but I just want to clear it up.
0:12:37.720000 - 0:12:42.720000::And just for the record, I went to public school.
0:12:43.040000 - 0:12:44.680000::It was technically public school.
0:12:44.680000 - 0:12:45.800000::It was in Switzerland.
0:12:45.800000 - 0:12:47.720000::It cost $75,000.
0:12:47.720000 - 0:12:48.800000::Oh, sure.
0:12:48.800000 - 0:12:50.520000::But technically it was public.
0:12:50.520000 - 0:12:53.640000::I just don't want to be grouped into that sort of category.
0:12:53.640000 - 0:12:54.480000::So, okay.
0:12:54.480000 - 0:12:57.480000::By the way, you would be so lucky to go to private school.
0:12:57.480000 - 0:12:58.720000::They're amazing.
0:12:58.720000 - 0:12:59.720000::Shack the fuck up.
0:12:59.720000 - 0:13:01.920000::You did go to private school till high school, am I right?
0:13:01.920000 - 0:13:03.240000::Dude, I know I did.
0:13:03.240000 - 0:13:04.080000::Too Christian.
0:13:04.080000 - 0:13:07.080000::Well, I'll tell you what, I think it devastated my parents.
0:13:09.600000 - 0:13:11.800000::Finance didn't devastate them, but it was pretty.
0:13:11.800000 - 0:13:14.240000::They were paying more than they could afford to send me to
0:13:14.240000 - 0:13:17.760000::this busted ass evangelical school.
0:13:17.760000 - 0:13:19.800000::But it's all like you gave up, God.
0:13:19.800000 - 0:13:21.360000::I kind of lied a little bit,
0:13:21.360000 - 0:13:25::because I did, in kindergarten, I did go to a school
0:13:25 - 0:13:30::that I believe was private, but it wasn't like that.
0:13:30 - 0:13:33.160000::The time Mandarin you learned fucking John Wick style.
0:13:34.720000 - 0:13:37.600000::It was where the principal could spank you.
0:13:37.600000 - 0:13:39.200000::I don't know if I said this all the time.
0:13:39.200000 - 0:13:40.840000::The principal could beat your ass.
0:13:40.840000 - 0:13:42.080000::Is that only the principal?
0:13:42.080000 - 0:13:42.920000::Not the teacher?
0:13:42.920000 - 0:13:46.520000::That's real Nate in 1997 or whatever.
0:13:46.520000 - 0:13:47.360000::Yes.
0:13:47.360000 - 0:13:48.280000::Good God.
0:13:48.280000 - 0:13:50.680000::The principal, you could, if there was always like,
0:13:50.680000 - 0:13:55.320000::the teachers were like, it was a some sort of Christian type of...
0:13:55.320000 - 0:13:56.520000::Of course it was.
0:13:56.520000 - 0:13:57.520000::Really?
0:13:57.520000 - 0:13:58.520000::Yeah.
0:13:58.520000 - 0:14:01.240000::They're the ones that say, turn the other cheek, right?
0:14:01.240000 - 0:14:03.960000::And it turns out they're one of the most evil organizations
0:14:03.960000 - 0:14:06.760000::of all time, spanking children.
0:14:06.760000 - 0:14:08.520000::What's next?
0:14:08.520000 - 0:14:09.360000::Good luck spanking me.
0:14:09.360000 - 0:14:10.960000::I'll put a grenade in my fucking pants.
0:14:10.960000 - 0:14:11.960000::Of course.
0:14:19 - 0:14:20.600000::That would be so surprising.
0:14:20.600000 - 0:14:22.560000::I think to someone that was spanking.
0:14:22.560000 - 0:14:25.240000::You're like, it's clearly like one of those lumpy grenades.
0:14:25.240000 - 0:14:27.720000::Yes, it's so big.
0:14:27.720000 - 0:14:28.560000::What is it?
0:14:28.560000 - 0:14:29.880000::It's like making a hissing sounds.
0:14:29.880000 - 0:14:32.160000::It's DIY grenade.
0:14:33.400000 - 0:14:34.440000::The DIY one.
0:14:34.440000 - 0:14:37.280000::Why did they have to make those grenades look so fucking tasty?
0:14:37.280000 - 0:14:38.760000::Looks like you could take a bite out of it
0:14:38.760000 - 0:14:41.440000::and it's gonna be all watermelon pink on the inside.
0:14:43.920000 - 0:14:44.920000::Damn.
0:14:46.160000 - 0:14:47.320000::American Father Nate.
0:14:47.320000 - 0:14:48.320000::It's really not into the grenade.
0:14:48.320000 - 0:14:49.160000::Oh yeah, I know.
0:14:49.160000 - 0:14:50.160000::I'm trying to do a grenade.
0:14:50.160000 - 0:14:53.840000::I'm gonna be silly, but something has been eroded today.
0:14:53.840000 - 0:14:54.960000::Quite seriously.
0:14:54.960000 - 0:14:56.280000::We'll get back, we'll get back.
0:14:56.280000 - 0:14:57.320000::Let's get into the Oscars
0:14:57.320000 - 0:14:59.960000::because I just need some time to process the betrayal
0:14:59.960000 - 0:15:00.960000::of the game.

0:15:00 - 0:15:02.720000::the lack of trust that I have for you now.
0:15:02.720000 - 0:15:04.440000::And you know what, this is a pet peeve of mine.
0:15:04.440000 - 0:15:06.640000::I don't like being got, I don't like people
0:15:06.640000 - 0:15:09.320000::like pranking like, you know what I'm saying?
0:15:09.320000 - 0:15:10.800000::That's why I've held back with your ass.
0:15:10.800000 - 0:15:12.200000::I've almost gotten you some of,
0:15:13.320000 - 0:15:15.520000::I've almost fucking taken you to the dry cleaners
0:15:15.520000 - 0:15:18.520000::and into the, yeah, but I know that's it.
0:15:19.640000 - 0:15:21.080000::Well, this is also highlighting a whole
0:15:21.080000 - 0:15:22.880000::true difference between all of us
0:15:22.880000 - 0:15:25.600000::because growing up for me,
0:15:25.600000 - 0:15:29.800000::I know you guys grew up like idolizing
0:15:29.800000 - 0:15:34.800000::a lot of like princes and families of royalty
0:15:34.800000 - 0:15:38.880000::and Eastern European tradition and like the fall
0:15:38.880000 - 0:15:40.560000::and stuff like that.
0:15:40.560000 - 0:15:42.400000::But we will listen to this,
0:15:42.400000 - 0:15:43.640000::we watch this TV show,

0:15:47.080000 - 0:15:51.040000::is a sign of love and admiration.
0:15:51.040000 - 0:15:52.520000::Is it an inclusion?
0:15:52.520000 - 0:15:54.080000::What happened to their friendships now?
0:15:54.080000 - 0:15:56.080000::How many of those guys are still close
0:15:56.080000 - 0:15:57.920000::and how many of them are still alive?
0:15:58.720000 - 0:16:01.480000::Well, dude, they're all still extremely close.

0:23:30.920000 - 0:23:36.440000::Robert Downey Jr. Nick I think Downey gets it because he probably paid you know how many millions you got to pay to win an Oscar
0:23:36.440000 - 0:23:41.920000::You know that right. It's rigged. Oh, yeah, you know how many millions go into Oscar campaigns?

0:24:08.740000 - 0:24:09.940000::Emma Stone
0:24:09.940000 - 0:24:11.940000::Miss Lily Gladstone
0:24:11.940000 - 0:24:16.580000::Lily Gladstone. Yeah, she better when that shit. Yeah, Gladstone
0:24:17.140000 - 0:24:20.900000::It's just so obvious because her performance is just much quieter
0:24:20.900000 - 0:24:24.580000::I think then what Emma Stone did a more internal. I think Emma Stone
0:24:24.580000 - 0:24:30.260000::They both of these women they you know they took home best actress at Goldman Globes in separate categories
0:24:30.260000 - 0:24:34.380000::Of course for comedy and drama, but before stone went on when the critics choice awards at the bath
0:24:34.780000 - 0:24:40.140000::Faptas Gladstone took the saggle word so it's kind of like the Oscars, you know she would also be the
0:24:41.740000 - 0:24:47.820000::Dude, you know, I was like rolled up in the back. Yeah, it would be the first Native American actor to receive Oscar if she wins this category
0:24:48.220000 - 0:24:50.220000::I'm torn
0:24:50.220000 - 0:24:52.220000::quoted
0:24:53.420000 - 0:24:58.620000::Dude, yeah, that's just my opinion. Don't go to CBS news.com because

0:25:00 - 0:25:01::It's not going to be.
0:25:01.760000 - 0:25:02.640000::So you're
0:25:02.640000 - 0:25:04.720000::money is on who Jack based off of that.
0:25:05.760000 - 0:25:10.040000::Um, based off of this article, I would say Gladstone.
0:25:10.080000 - 0:25:12.680000::Gladstone. It's, it's no, it's no contest.
0:25:12.680000 - 0:25:13.480000::Well, you know what?
0:25:13.480000 - 0:25:18.800000::We have a, the, the Oscars are, it's, one, it's easy to predict this year just for a number
0:25:18.800000 - 0:25:19.520000::of different reasons.
0:25:19.520000 - 0:25:25.560000::But also it's the, it's kind of the last awards show of the year, right?
0:25:25.720000 - 0:25:28.920000::Cause we've already had the chance to see what the Sag Awards are doing.
0:25:29.160000 - 0:25:34.560000::What the, uh, the Golden Globes, what the Emmys are, well, Emmys are a different thing.
0:25:34.560000 - 0:25:36.400000::But what else do we have?
0:25:36.400000 - 0:25:37.560000::The fucking independence mirror.
0:25:37.720000 - 0:25:41.080000::We've had the feelers of what everybody's gravitating towards.
0:25:41.080000 - 0:25:41.880000::You know what I'm saying?
0:25:41.880000 - 0:25:46.040000::So I feel like it's easier to predict these questions.
0:25:46.240000 - 0:25:47::Question.
0:25:47.280000 - 0:25:53.560000::Why is there no award ceremony for the production teams, the PAs, the key grips,
0:25:53.880000 - 0:25:57.920000::the gaffers, the boom mic operators.
0:25:58.480000 - 0:26:00.400000::Why is there not one of these Eric?
0:26:00.400000 - 0:26:01.360000::I'm going to stop you right there.
0:26:01.360000 - 0:26:04.400000::Nothing you do can make up for the way you treated it.
0:26:05.840000 - 0:26:07.640000::Production team on the bear.
0:26:07.720000 - 0:26:08.240000::Okay.
0:26:08.440000 - 0:26:11.960000::Dude, well, they were fucking acting up and they fucking gotten away with my performance.
0:26:11.960000 - 0:26:14.800000::I just, you brought a source of pistol paintball gun.
0:26:14.800000 - 0:26:15.640000::I've never seen one of these.
0:26:15.640000 - 0:26:19.520000::You had a pistol paintball gun silenced and you literally were going around popping
0:26:19.520000 - 0:26:20.520000::gaffers in the head.
0:26:20.680000 - 0:26:22.080000::You were shooting people in the nipples.
0:26:22.120000 - 0:26:25.880000::Well, dude, if these care, if they keep wearing these light jangle-ass,
0:26:25.880000 - 0:26:29.040000::loud-ass carabiners that get that fucking, it's like,

0:26:35.200000 - 0:26:39.840000::But I do want to honor them from afar with an award show unlimited beer,
0:26:40.200000 - 0:26:41.200000::unlimited fucking.
0:26:42.600000 - 0:26:43.880000::I don't know what else I'm into.
0:26:44.120000 - 0:26:45.240000::A lot of them like to cycle.
0:26:45.240000 - 0:26:45.560000::I think.
0:26:45.560000 - 0:26:46.240000::But why is it?
0:26:46.240000 - 0:26:46.640000::Yeah.
0:26:48.960000 - 0:26:49.320000::Okay.

0:26:51.920000 - 0:26:54.560000::I think Ferrera's got it on lock, frankly.
0:26:56.200000 - 0:26:56.600000::Who's that?
0:26:56.600000 - 0:26:57.200000::What was it?

0:27:05.120000 - 0:27:05.960000::So she deserves it.
0:27:05.960000 - 0:27:08.960000::Holdover sweeps the, the Oscars.
0:27:10.840000 - 0:27:16.040000::Ferrera, there's a, there, somebody's accusing Alex

0:27:18.600000 - 0:27:20.320000::And that's where I draw the line.
0:27:21.960000 - 0:27:23.520000::Because you're stealing so much.
0:27:24.520000 - 0:27:27.200000::In pro plagiarization or

0:27:44.400000 - 0:27:44.880000::Yeah.
0:27:45 - 0:27:49.520000::Because we should have a live fucking blood pressure meter on the YouTube channel

0:27:50.840000 - 0:27:52.240000::We don't want to raise it.

0:37:31.100000 - 0:37:36.100000::Imagine if everybody was on all the joy tech.
0:37:36.100000 - 0:37:37.100000::Yeah.
0:37:37.100000 - 0:37:38.100000::Which one?
0:37:38.100000 - 0:37:39.100000::Go ahead, Jay.
0:37:39.100000 - 0:37:42.100000::No, I was going to say imagine if everybody's ever listened to joy tactics.
0:37:42.100000 - 0:37:45.100000::There's no one giant mattress all having a sleep over together.
0:37:45.100000 - 0:37:47.100000::So, oh, you lived a key life.
0:37:47.100000 - 0:37:56.100000::I think there might be a little bit too much chemistry on that thing because of all, because of all of our listeners have similar mindsets and views on the world.
0:37:56.100000 - 0:37:57.100000::And I would be giggling too.
0:37:57.100000 - 0:37:59.100000::I listen to us as a 6.5 and above.
0:37:59.100000 - 0:38:00.100000::No question.
0:38:00.100000 - 0:38:03.100000::I think it would turn into one giant gang bang.
0:38:03.100000 - 0:38:04.100000::Oh, cheer, man.
0:38:04.100000 - 0:38:05.100000::All on you.
0:38:05.100000 - 0:38:08.100000::You're so overwell.
0:38:08.100000 - 0:38:09.100000::Complete fantasy.
0:38:09.100000 - 0:38:12.100000::So, 60 60 people.
0:38:12.100000 - 0:38:17.100000::I think it's the fuck everybody who listens to joy tactics.
0:38:17.100000 - 0:38:22.100000::May, will you promise if you get canceled to start doing hardcore pornography?
0:38:22.100000 - 0:38:23.100000::Oh, 100%.
0:38:23.100000 - 0:38:29.100000::I just think that'll be the funny assumption on the funny in a way that is still so sexy.
0:38:29.100000 - 0:38:33.100000::Because I know you got to like that, but as your friend is.
0:38:33.100000 - 0:38:36.100000::It's just fuck me.
0:38:36.100000 - 0:38:37.100000::It's crazy.

0:38:38.100000 - 0:38:40.100000::What's about Fey Webster?
0:38:40.100000 - 0:38:45.100000::Oh, I just wanted to highlight another song that I liked off of that album.
0:38:45.100000 - 0:38:46.100000::Which?
0:38:46.100000 - 0:38:47.100000::Shout it out.
0:38:47.100000 - 0:38:52.100000::Well, there's two songs that are in my rotation that are going to be in, I can already predict it.
0:38:52.100000 - 0:38:54.100000::These are going to be my top songs.
0:38:54.100000 - 0:38:56.100000::And they're going to be in your short films to see.
0:38:56.100000 - 0:38:57.100000::Exactly.

0:39:04.100000 - 0:39:06.100000::It is, I want to quit all the time.
0:39:06.100000 - 0:39:07.100000::That one.
0:39:07.100000 - 0:39:08.100000::Oh, okay.
0:39:08.100000 - 0:39:09.100000::I need to listen to that.
0:39:09.100000 - 0:39:13.100000::And then, what is the other one?
0:39:13.100000 - 0:39:14.100000::The eBay one.
0:39:14.100000 - 0:39:15.100000::No.

0:39:19.100000 - 0:39:20.100000::It was the first song on the album.
0:39:20.100000 - 0:39:21.100000::It's so good.
0:39:21.100000 - 0:39:22.100000::Underdress at this opening?

0:39:30.100000 - 0:39:31.100000::Let me just put it like this.

0:39:36.100000 - 0:39:44.100000::To unlock thoughts in you that you would never have thought before you listen to it.
0:39:44.100000 - 0:39:45.100000::You know what I'm saying?
0:39:45.100000 - 0:39:47.100000::It's the same thing as how I do it.
0:39:47.100000 - 0:39:48.100000::All art does this.
0:39:48.100000 - 0:39:49.100000::This is the same thing.
0:39:49.100000 - 0:39:50.100000::I'm going to look at Manet and Monet.
0:39:50.100000 - 0:39:51.100000::I'm going to look at Manet and Monet.
0:39:51.100000 - 0:39:52.100000::I'm going to look at Manet and Monet.
0:39:52.100000 - 0:39:56.100000::This is the same thing as I'm going to look at Manet and Monet.
0:39:56.100000 - 0:39:59.100000::It just unlocks new emotions and feelings.

0:40:00 - 0:40:02::What else?
0:40:03 - 0:40:05::What else?
0:40:09 - 0:40:11::So let me read a couple of these. Let's get back to the Oscar.
0:40:11 - 0:40:15::Yes, because these are understandable. No, listen, I'm going to read some
0:40:15 - 0:40:18::Fay Webster lyrics and
0:40:18 - 0:40:23::Okay, please watch the watch the undeniable motion that comes out of you as
0:40:23 - 0:40:25::you hear these concepts ready.

0:40:32 - 0:40:37::I stop drinking really for no reason other than seeing you drunk outside.
0:40:37 - 0:40:44::I and I'm going to throw in like words to string the lyrics together by the way because otherwise it wouldn't make sense for a human being.
0:40:44 - 0:40:53::Yeah, I stopped drinking kind of for no reason really other than seeing you fucking drunk out because I used to be self conscious right but I really am and then I say this.
0:40:53 - 0:41:00::I think I'll figure it out. I think I'll figure it out. I think I'll figure it out.
0:41:00 - 0:41:02::I think I'll figure it out.
0:41:02 - 0:41:05::Uh huh.
0:41:09 - 0:41:17::This just goes to show that it is it is not the words themselves but the medium that it's channel.
0:41:18 - 0:41:24::Listening to you say that makes me want to help you makes me want to go come to your house immediately and make sure you're okay.
0:41:24 - 0:41:26::But coming through Fay Webster.
0:41:26 - 0:41:29::Yeah, that should be in a million future films.
0:41:29 - 0:41:32::Closing out the credits opening up the movie whatever.
0:41:32 - 0:41:39::In the go to ways if somebody if somebody tries to make a song that includes all of the text of joy tactics.
0:41:39 - 0:41:43::It's like well, first of all, that'd be incredibly long, right?
0:41:43 - 0:41:50::Can someone do that for us make a full episode and two kind of a hundred Geck style music song.
0:41:50 - 0:41:53::He's beat it up, love down, chop it up, screw it.
0:41:53 - 0:41:58::Can someone please chop and screw one of our soads?
0:41:58 - 0:42:01::What's the opposite of chopping a little guy?
0:42:01 - 0:42:06::Uh, isn't it either sliced and behaved?
0:42:06 - 0:42:10::Think on it. Just think on it for the next time.

0:42:37 - 0:42:38::Or was that two years ago?
0:42:38 - 0:42:41::No, that must have been two years ago now.
0:42:41 - 0:42:44::Those two, because last year was Sarah's birthday party.
0:42:44 - 0:42:49::Oh, right.
0:42:49 - 0:42:50::So this year, what's going to happen?
0:42:50 - 0:42:54::Killian Murphy and fucking who else is going to throw down?
0:42:54 - 0:42:56::Who's throwing down?
0:42:56 - 0:42:59::Well, killian and just right.
0:42:59 - 0:43:04::If somebody, Bradley Cooper is going to show up in the Leonard Bernstein prosthetics.
0:43:05 - 0:43:09::If somebody says no, they're going to walk out with a bloody eye and a knuckle.
0:43:09 - 0:43:15.280000::He clearly has like old timey dynamite layer, like all underneath his clothes, like lumpy ass
0:43:15.280000 - 0:43:23::suit. He's got the grenade and his fucking back pocket deck, bending your style.
0:43:23 - 0:43:25::The Booneer Naming.
0:43:25 - 0:43:27::Okay. Oh, yeah.
0:43:27 - 0:43:30::Let's hit the animated feature film.
0:43:30 - 0:43:33::I mean, I saw all of these elemental pneumonia.
0:43:33 - 0:43:35::Oh, Sarah was in the Mona.
0:43:35 - 0:43:37::So yeah, we got her for a pneumonia.
0:43:37 - 0:43:39::Spider-Man across the spiderverse.
0:43:39 - 0:43:42::I fucking waited in a tent outside the regal to see that.
0:43:42 - 0:43:43::Didn't need to.
0:43:43 - 0:43:44::Didn't need to.
0:43:44 - 0:43:49::Yeah, livestreamed it.
0:43:49 - 0:43:52::I think it's got to be Spider-Man across the spiderverse.
0:43:52 - 0:43:54::That was a freaking monumental hit.
0:43:54 - 0:43:55::Are you kidding me?
0:43:55 - 0:43:57::Well, that was a multi.
0:43:57 - 0:44:03::You think it's the boy in the hair on the hair on the hair on the hair on.
0:44:03 - 0:44:06::Yeah, you heard the way I fucking said that shit, man.
0:44:06 - 0:44:07::What is this?
0:44:07 - 0:44:09::Is this me as ake's last picture?
0:44:09 - 0:44:10::Y'all.
0:44:10 - 0:44:11::Is it really dude?
0:44:11 - 0:44:12::Or is he lying?
0:44:12 - 0:44:13::I think so.
0:44:13 - 0:44:16::Just to push ticket sales because I know I think he's too old to lie about that.
0:44:16 - 0:44:17::You know, yeah, right.
0:44:17 - 0:44:23::He's just like, I think he's really just like, yo, I think I'm I think I'm dead like in the next couple of years.
0:44:23 - 0:44:25::So well, he's my old six too.
0:44:25 - 0:44:28::And he's in his 80s.
0:44:28 - 0:44:33::I think he's one of those people that's got away with a passion and a will to live.
0:44:33 - 0:44:38::You saw that documentary, the darkness of the tears of the whatever, you know, the.
0:44:38 - 0:44:40::Talk about the madness of the darkness on that.
0:44:40 - 0:44:46::That's all that incredible documentary on his creative process and animation style.
0:44:46 - 0:44:49::So what you think it's the boy in the hair on.
0:44:49 - 0:44:50::I don't know.
0:44:50 - 0:44:53::I think that's what that's what I would vote for.
0:44:53 - 0:44:59::And I think that might win, but I think you might be right with this, the spider verse one.

0:45:00 - 0:45:10::Yeah, which I haven't even seen the boy in the I haven't even seen it to be honest.
0:45:10 - 0:45:17::But um, oh, oh, oh, oh, no, we're not we're not losing momentum.
0:45:17 - 0:45:21::I know you think that was just one of the richest topic.
0:45:21 - 0:45:27::I know you think that this isn't no, cause we need to talk about the movie perfect
0:45:27 - 0:45:31::days. No, I have not seen perfect. Oh, I want to see that.
0:45:31 - 0:45:33::Janitor was it 10 minutes long?
0:45:33 - 0:45:38::Well, it's a movie feature like film man. Wow.
0:45:38 - 0:45:45::And it and it was just totally overlooked by all the awards shows this year.
0:45:45 - 0:45:48::And it is just so good really so incredible.
0:45:48 - 0:45:51::It's a really great, great film.
0:45:51 - 0:45:56::But I think it's only up for like one category and it's definitely not going to win.
0:45:56 - 0:45:59::But man, I'm watching it today.
0:45:59 - 0:46:01::I'm watching that shit today.
0:46:01 - 0:46:04::Shall I play persona or watch that today?
