0:01:05 - 0:01:13.120000::Oras. Oras. Different style of oras. Oratators.
0:01:13.120000 - 0:01:24.160000::I want to apologize to the listeners first off that you might hear a little echo on this podcast. Well, that's because I just moved into a six bedroom house here in LA and the hills.
0:01:24.160000 - 0:01:32::Deep within the hills in a place that no one will ever find me unless I want to be found and then yeah, come on through for the party.
0:01:32 - 0:01:39.480000::But for now, it's unfurnished as I'm just we're just figuring out the vibe of the place, the aura of the place.
0:01:39.480000 - 0:01:46.600000::And then sooner than you can imagine, it's gonna be filled with mid-century modern furniture as far as I can see.
0:01:46.600000 - 0:01:50.840000::Putting a cold plunge in the living room.
0:01:50.840000 - 0:01:57.440000::Well, maybe we can fix the echo. No, we can put an echo on me and Nate so that.
0:01:57.440000 - 0:02:04.040000::Oh, so it's like we're all the same room. Yeah, I do want a conversation pit badly.
0:02:04.040000 - 0:02:10.640000::Oh, that mad man. If you raise the rest of the floor and then just leave. Yeah, that's right. Part of it down.
0:02:10.640000 - 0:02:17.320000::Yeah, that'd be nice. That's what I'm talking about. A conversation pit. Oh, you don't know about this Nate.
0:02:17.320000 - 0:02:24.880000::It's a human cereal bowl for getting along. You are so introverted. You would never even think of a conversation pit.
0:02:24.880000 - 0:02:29.240000::That's your hell. That's your ninth level of hell.
0:02:29.240000 - 0:02:37.520000::Nate, you ever see the picture of a living room and there's two steps down into like a lower little circle of the living room?
0:02:37.520000 - 0:02:40.760000::Like something like a fireplace?
0:02:40.760000 - 0:02:49.760000::You know what? I'm really like I can picture it just like what you're describing, but I don't know they have ever seen one of these.
0:02:49.760000 - 0:02:56.960000::Imagine this. You come home from a long day at the TV network. Okay. Look, I get what the conversation is.
0:02:56.960000 - 0:03:03.360000::I get what it's function is. I get what it is. Oh, Nate, Nate, Jason today gives us house. Remember his.
0:03:03.360000 - 0:03:05.360000::Oh, right.
0:03:05.360000 - 0:03:09.160000::No, but I want you to imagine something. Nate, because I don't think you've imagined this yet.
0:03:09.160000 - 0:03:15.160000::You come home from a long day at the TV studio, wherever or at the venture capitalism firm.
0:03:15.160000 - 0:03:25.360000::And you are a little tired. You get home and the place is just covered wall to wall with orange sort of shag carpet.
0:03:25.360000 - 0:03:34.860000::And who's on. There's body rate playing on vinyl. Okay. And he looked down. Oh, oops. There's your girl.
0:03:34.860000 - 0:03:42.660000::And she's standing in the conversation pit with a leader of martini already made ice cold shaken.
0:03:42.660000 - 0:03:46.160000::She's got that fucking sh.
0:03:46.160000 - 0:03:51.260000::What do you the body con dress on? She's got amazing curves. Just perfect.
0:03:51.260000 - 0:03:57.760000::And if you're a woman, listen to this. Imagine you see a man down there with a fat. It has asked so fucking fat.
0:03:57.860000 - 0:04:07.860000::And and if you're safe as actual like me, imagine large long careers down there sitting mermaid style with his bag out.
0:04:07.860000 - 0:04:11.060000::And a bottle of grape juice.
0:04:11.060000 - 0:04:17.860000::Mm-hmm. And you go down there and you just chat. You just talk about your day. No TV. No TV.
0:04:17.860000 - 0:04:22.760000::You want show gun at night. No TV. No, no. There's no way to do it.
0:04:22.760000 - 0:04:27.660000::Because you're screening something you can pull the projector screen down. Okay.
0:04:27.660000 - 0:04:33.760000::That's for screenings only and for study film study. But no, we don't distract ourselves with screens.
0:04:33.760000 - 0:04:39.360000::We distract ourselves with conversation in the pit and you get fucked up every night.
0:04:39.360000 - 0:04:44.360000::And then you take a pill that makes hangovers fully go away and you wake up to go to the gym.
0:04:44.360000 - 0:04:50.460000::And he left more weight than anyone else else ever has.
0:04:50.460000 - 0:04:56.460000::There's Utopia. Literally that sounds pretty nice to me.
0:04:56.460000 - 0:05:00.060000::Is there like cat in my head? There's like a night.

0:05:00 - 0:05:06::there's definitely a seating arrangement in the course.
0:05:06 - 0:05:08::Of course, this is interesting.
0:05:08 - 0:05:14::It's a circular pit or it could be a square style pit.
0:05:14 - 0:05:18::And now there's going to be wheelchair accessibility ramp in mine and my house.
0:05:18 - 0:05:19::That's for sure.
0:05:19 - 0:05:22::We don't have a ramp but we have the fucking ropes.
0:05:22 - 0:05:24::We have ropes all over the place.
0:05:24 - 0:05:26::So they could swing down like that?
0:05:26 - 0:05:27::Yeah.
0:05:28 - 0:05:32::And it's so soft in there that if you just, yeah, it's fine.
0:05:32 - 0:05:35::Now let's say let's type go ahead.
0:05:35 - 0:05:39::Sounds though that just sounds like hell.
0:05:39 - 0:05:41::Do you want to get into it?
0:05:41 - 0:05:42::What do you want?
0:05:42 - 0:05:44::Yeah, do you want to get into it?
0:05:44 - 0:05:47::Because what is your fantasy being all alone for the rest of your life?
0:05:47 - 0:05:51::The isolation pit that is deep into your home.
0:05:51 - 0:05:53::It's just like it's not even furnished.
0:05:53 - 0:05:57::It's just a hole that you dig in the middle of your living room.
0:05:57 - 0:06:01::They lower me down 500, 600 feet into the earth.
0:06:01 - 0:06:02::It's warmer.
0:06:02 - 0:06:05::It's warm and then it gets really cold.
0:06:05 - 0:06:11::It's warm first and then you're pitching a theory where the middle of the earth is icy.
0:06:11 - 0:06:12::Well, there's a part.
0:06:12 - 0:06:14::There's probably a layer that's cold.
0:06:14 - 0:06:19::I bet you it gets of course it's hot in the middle because fucking that's where hell is.
0:06:20 - 0:06:29::If you go lower, I bet you there's one the mantle, the crust, the crustation layer, one of those layers is like.
0:06:29 - 0:06:33::One of those layers is probably ice cold.
0:06:33 - 0:06:34::Oh, for sure.
0:06:34 - 0:06:35::I bet a couple of those.
0:06:35 - 0:06:39::Well, water, you think well water comes out boiling hot?
0:06:39 - 0:06:42::No, I'm saying I think we're all on the same page.
0:06:42 - 0:06:44::That's got to be the correct.
0:06:44 - 0:06:50::But the crust you're saying is yeah, I think it's just the order where you probably skipped the crust Nate because you went straight to warm.
0:06:50 - 0:06:52::He said it was warm first.
0:06:52 - 0:06:53::No, why don't you do this?
0:06:53 - 0:06:59::No, I'm saying it's warm and then it's because the earth I guarantee you the earth works in that mysterious way.
0:06:59 - 0:07:01::You heard me correct.
0:07:01 - 0:07:05::It's warm and then you're like oh fuck this is going to suck the lonely down.
0:07:05 - 0:07:06::Getting fucking on.
0:07:06 - 0:07:07::How do you take a jacket off?
0:07:07 - 0:07:09::This is going to suck it back on.
0:07:09 - 0:07:10::Yeah, why did I do this?
0:07:10 - 0:07:12::And then it gets fucking ice cold.
0:07:12 - 0:07:13::And then there we go.
0:07:13 - 0:07:14::Now I'm at the layer.
0:07:14 - 0:07:16::And that's what you want to be.
0:07:16 - 0:07:18::Have you guys watched showgun yet?
0:07:18 - 0:07:21::No, I watched the first episode.
0:07:21 - 0:07:24::The first episode and I hate this.
0:07:24 - 0:07:28::But I got like second screen poisoned by it.
0:07:28 - 0:07:30::Like I was just on my phone and I was like that's on.
0:07:30 - 0:07:31::And I wasn't even paying attention.
0:07:31 - 0:07:34::I was like what the fuck am I doing dude?
0:07:34 - 0:07:38::Like this I like literally can't even tell you what the story was.
0:07:38 - 0:07:40::Like I was on my phone the whole time.
0:07:40 - 0:07:42::You need to be reading what's taking a minute.
0:07:42 - 0:07:45::I'm fucking watch this again to fucking.
0:07:45 - 0:07:48::I want to watch it because I know I would like it.
0:07:48 - 0:07:51::If you're if you're fluent conversationally in Japanese,
0:07:51 - 0:07:53::then yeah, you don't need to use the subtitles.
0:07:53 - 0:07:56::But if you even read a little bit less than fluid,
0:07:56 - 0:07:59::you need to read that shit to know what's going on.
0:07:59 - 0:08:03::But I'll bring it up because there's a scene in the first episode
0:08:03 - 0:08:08::where one of the what they call this is what I found interesting to the Japanese.
0:08:08 - 0:08:13::The Portuguese in English are barbarians when actually the English
0:08:13 - 0:08:16::and the Portuguese thought the Japanese were barbarians.
0:08:16 - 0:08:19::That's what you call bias, cultural bias.
0:08:19 - 0:08:22::That was a little too hard for Rita.
0:08:22 - 0:08:27::Anyways, there's a scene where a guy is being boiled alive.
0:08:27 - 0:08:29::Lobster style.
0:08:29 - 0:08:31::Lobster style in a giant pot.
0:08:31 - 0:08:33::A Japanese giant pot.
0:08:33 - 0:08:34::Does he want that or they do?
0:08:34 - 0:08:35::No, no, he does.
0:08:35 - 0:08:37::That's the last thing he wants.
0:08:37 - 0:08:38::It's against his word.
0:08:38 - 0:08:41::So this is a violent show.
0:08:41 - 0:08:44::Oh, dude, there's violence for sure.
0:08:44 - 0:08:46::But tastefully violence.
0:08:46 - 0:08:47::But tastefully done.
0:08:47 - 0:08:49::Can you imagine being boiled alive?
0:08:49 - 0:08:50::Yeah.
0:08:50 - 0:08:52::Being all boiled as such?
0:08:52 - 0:08:53::Yeah.
0:08:53 - 0:08:55::I felt emotional pain like that.
0:08:55 - 0:08:57::Yeah, what?
0:08:57 - 0:09:00::No, I was watching the debate.
0:09:00 - 0:09:02::Yeah, I was fucking boiling.
0:09:02 - 0:09:04::We can't talk about politics.
0:09:04 - 0:09:05::No, no, no.
0:09:05 - 0:09:08::We need to talk about what this episode is about, which is the...
0:09:08 - 0:09:09::Oras.
0:09:09 - 0:09:11::Or the idea of Oras.
0:09:11 - 0:09:12::You know what?
0:09:12 - 0:09:15::You brought up at a point that you're like...
0:09:15 - 0:09:18::We are always associate Oras as a human...
0:09:18 - 0:09:21::A function of the human body.
0:09:21 - 0:09:22::You know?
0:09:22 - 0:09:23::Everybody has an Ora.
0:09:23 - 0:09:24::But you were saying your house.
0:09:24 - 0:09:27::We're not saying you're trying to get your house.
0:09:27 - 0:09:29::Or a right...
0:09:29 - 0:09:32::I don't know if I said that, but I agree with that.
0:09:32 - 0:09:35::You're basically hinting that objects can have Oras.
0:09:35 - 0:09:37::Of course they can.
0:09:37 - 0:09:39::Thought of that previously.
0:09:39 - 0:09:42::So you're expanding my world view of what an Ora can.
0:09:42 - 0:09:46::Because, yeah, of course, a shoe can have an Ora, you know?
0:09:46 - 0:09:47::Right.
0:09:47 - 0:09:50::A time can have an Ora.
0:09:50 - 0:09:51::Take it there.
0:09:51 - 0:09:52::Right.
0:09:52 - 0:09:53::The eighties have to exist.
0:09:53 - 0:09:55::The eighties have a moan.
0:09:55 - 0:09:56::A black and white.
0:09:56 - 0:09:58::A decade can...
0:09:58 - 0:09:59::Yeah.
0:09:59 - 0:10:00::A spoon can have a moan.

0:10:00 - 0:10:10.280000::What's the most powerful era and what's the most or a less era most aura ever done 1940s?
0:10:15.640000 - 0:10:20.080000::Okay, right least aura has to be what the
0:10:21.080000 - 0:10:23.080000::2010 2012 yeah
0:10:24.480000 - 0:10:26.480000::That but I didn't want to disrespect
0:10:27.360000 - 0:10:29.360000::20 world is
0:10:29.360000 - 0:10:32.760000::20 is still pretty bad. We're still in one of the most
0:10:34.160000 - 0:10:35.760000::least or a
0:10:35.760000 - 0:10:38.080000::Moments that's ever existed in human history
0:10:38.560000 - 0:10:43.480000::Well, when you're in the aura you can't see the aura for the trees you should I'm saying because the lights
0:10:43.480000 - 0:10:45.800000::I can understand what you're saying you can't fall off
0:10:46.680000 - 0:10:51.960000::But you know what I was when it was like 2000 in the 2000s whatever
0:10:51.960000 - 0:10:58.600000::2000s 2010s I was like start the same thing where I was like you know what this doesn't feel like
0:10:58.920000 - 0:11:03.880000::When you think about like the 70s and the in the 80s it feels like there was a distinct like
0:11:05.160000 - 0:11:11.680000::aesthetic and and people are dressing all that the big mustaches the hair whatever and I was like maybe
0:11:11.680000 - 0:11:15.920000::I'll maybe we'll be able to look back on it and and this will be like or
0:11:16.680000 - 0:11:20.720000::It will have that but I don't think it does have as clear of a
0:11:21.520000 - 0:11:29.080000::Vibes the 90s 80s whatever the 70s and by the way, we're so fortunate to have a decade that's
0:11:30.680000 - 0:11:36.320000::Nobody talks about the 17 30s the 17 40s 17. See you imagine that right 17
0:11:36.320000 - 0:11:40.660000::17 70s that would be crazy if they had a different whole different
0:11:40.660000 - 0:11:47.840000::Fucking style each decade. Well, bro here. Let me blow your mind to them. It was crazy different. Oh, there's a new fucking
0:11:48.400000 - 0:11:50.400000::Best everyone's wearing that's
0:11:51.520000 - 0:11:57.440000::17 90s. Oh man, they should have a different type of buckles that the fucking 1800s
0:11:58.920000 - 0:12:02.720000::You remember green sleeves remember her no
0:12:03.120000 - 0:12:07.280000::She somebody sang a song about her one time they fell in love with her
0:12:07.560000 - 0:12:10.320000::She was probably the first person to ever have green sleeves
0:12:11.200000 - 0:12:16.720000::So they didn't even have the color green so then once another probably a decade where they thought well now clothes
0:12:16.720000 - 0:12:23.040000::Can be any color because they used all just be mud color whatever clothes were made out of it first and then now it's crazy
0:12:23.440000 - 0:12:30.280000::Right, but an aura can you can have by the way when I warn everybody I would say that actually the 2010s had a very powerful aura
0:12:30.280000 - 0:12:35.600000::And the 20 20 power for so powerful we can't even know yet the aura
0:12:36.520000 - 0:12:38.520000::There has to be
0:12:38.520000 - 0:12:40.520000::words to describe
0:12:41.120000 - 0:12:43.120000::To describe auras
0:12:43.240000 - 0:12:49.240000::So there could be positive auras think of the 60s think of flower power right think of breeze on earth and smoking weed and Jim
0:12:49.240000 - 0:12:51.240000::There's two sides to that coin right
0:12:52.360000 - 0:12:55.360000::Remember this there's two sides to the aura aura coins
0:12:55.920000 - 0:13:02.320000::Yeah, one side of that aura coin from the 60s is flower power and Jimmy Hendrix who died by vomit and
0:13:03.080000 - 0:13:07.240000::The doors and all the amazing movie the graduate the sexy movie with us
0:13:07.240000 - 0:13:12.680000::The bird's earlier, but the birds on the other side of the coin housing prices
0:13:13.120000 - 0:13:21.640000::On the other side of the reasonable horrors of Vietnam now now now the assassination of JFK what that is is people who don't
0:13:22.360000 - 0:13:29.840000::Notice how peaceful was it here in America was very peaceful and in Vietnam to you so well I was there I wasn't there
0:13:30.240000 - 0:13:39.360000::But in Vietnam it was so horrible and why do you think it's a coincidence that you're so far far physically geographically from the aura
0:13:40.240000 - 0:13:43.520000::So aura they were just in the fallout, you know
0:13:43.520000 - 0:13:48.160000::I'm saying they were beyond the fallout zone beyond the event horizon of the of the aura
0:13:49 - 0:13:55.520000::So that's a positive aura that that Vietnam didn't have the luxury of being in right right because Jimmy Hendrix coming in the Jimmy
0:13:57.320000 - 0:14:02.200000::But then there's negative auras right negative auras where you look at the 2010s and
0:14:03.120000 - 0:14:04.880000::America was
0:14:04.880000 - 0:14:09.120000::Something was something is currently happening where we're stuck in a powerful negative aura of
0:14:09.560000 - 0:14:17.720000::Course well, I want to bring this up because color does tie into aura so much look at the color that is seeping through middle America
0:14:18.920000 - 0:14:23.040000::renovated homes, okay take my mom's condo for example
0:14:23.480000 - 0:14:25.480000::why
0:14:25.480000 - 0:14:28.240000::No even worse dark gray
0:14:28.960000 - 0:14:35.560000::Gray gray would fake wood floors, okay, not to shame my mom gray sort of silver
0:14:37.080000 - 0:14:39.080000::accessories and fixtures
0:14:40.600000 - 0:14:45.600000::You know I take I would take the 2000s sort of Italian rustic farmhouse aesthetic a
0:14:46.600000 - 0:14:52.320000::Million the kind of cringey moan number that when all the rich kids had the kind of like Italian farmhouse style homes
0:14:52.320000 - 0:14:58.960000::Nate what do you think I have never met a rich I've never been in a rich person's house. I've never met a rich kid

0:15:00 - 0:15:06.300000::I know but now it's all replaced with gray just target sadness
0:15:06.300000 - 0:15:12.720000::He's not seen. Isn't this like the colors great. There's millennial gray. Yeah, right right
0:15:13.240000 - 0:15:17.560000::Disgusting we're getting we're getting to something quite interesting here. I want to keep digging I
0:15:18.440000 - 0:15:20.440000::Want to keep digging well
0:15:21.760000 - 0:15:27.340000::You know, I want to keep digging as well, but I can I give a personal
0:15:28.340000 - 0:15:37.860000::A recent or a related story. Yeah, that I of course I think it could because we didn't talk about our individual or is yet
0:15:37.860000 - 0:15:42.360000::No, we have like that's a very vulnerable thing to do. Yeah, right
0:15:43.980000 - 0:15:49.680000::So there I was getting my oil changed at the the Glendale Loop Center
0:15:49.780000 - 0:15:51.780000::Okay, I'll give you a shout out
0:15:51.860000 - 0:15:53.860000::Okay, no, no
0:15:53.860000 - 0:15:55.860000::stop
0:15:55.860000 - 0:15:57.860000::Pause proceed man like
0:16:00.580000 - 0:16:05.120000::Loop Center, are you getting that lubed up every 5,000 or what?
0:16:05.500000 - 0:16:09.220000::Yeah, I'm getting it lubed up every chance I get man
0:16:10.180000 - 0:16:16.440000::Every time that see the Prius has a maintenance required thing on it. Do you do your car have that? Yeah, Mazda
0:16:17.540000 - 0:16:19.740000::So it tells you when you need it anyways, I
0:16:20.620000 - 0:16:24.180000::Go up to the loop center pull up to the
0:16:25.100000 - 0:16:31.100000::This there's this like line, you know, I get I always get my maintenance in there or my
0:16:31.380000 - 0:16:35.100000::Whatever oil change and he says, you know what we're trying to backed up
0:16:35.100000 - 0:16:42.300000::Why don't you go park in the parking lot and then all all like you know come over and tell you when when you can pull up to the
0:16:42.900000 - 0:16:46.780000::Oil change area so I'm parked in the parking lot
0:16:47.380000 - 0:16:49.380000::One of the mechanics comes over to me
0:16:50.740000 - 0:16:57.060000::With a note card a note that has something written on it and it says hi. I am a mechanic
0:16:58.420000 - 0:16:59.400000::at
0:16:59.400000 - 0:17:01.400000::Glendale Loop Center and
0:17:02.140000 - 0:17:07.180000::You cannot park here like a card like that and I think he thought I was like
0:17:08.340000 - 0:17:12.660000::like kind of a person that lived in my car and and
0:17:13.300000 - 0:17:15.300000::and
0:17:15.300000 - 0:17:17.100000::was just like
0:17:17.100000 - 0:17:24.260000::Parked in the parking lot and I open my door and he sees and he's because because you can't feel an aura through a window
0:17:24.260000 - 0:17:28.020000::Oh my god, so he gets the pole and scientifically
0:17:28.860000 - 0:17:35.940000::He gets the flesh to flesh aura as soon as I pull out the door and look at it as asked immediately night and day
0:17:35.940000 - 0:17:40.020000::So oh my god, he he senses my powerful aura
0:17:40.260000 - 0:17:42.020000::Right
0:17:42.020000 - 0:17:44.020000::Rightening aura
0:17:44.020000 - 0:17:51.620000::You can't feel this on the podcast the zoom but you guys would say I have a very threatening. Oh, yeah, yeah
0:17:51.620000 - 0:17:55.320000::It's something it's something to be something to behold for sure
0:17:55.320000 - 0:18:01.060000::And in addition to the aura, it's the you don't really do personal space. You don't right
0:18:01.060000 - 0:18:08.180000::Right right up in your fucking real dude. It's that old spice swagger fucking coming right through you can smell the old
0:18:08.180000 - 0:18:12.980000::Black swagger through the glass. Yep. I didn't use this mouthwash for no reason
0:18:15.300000 - 0:18:17.300000::That's a good teacher
0:18:17.860000 - 0:18:23.260000::But he says he immediately starts apologizing. Oh my god. I'm so sorry. I thought you were
0:18:23.980000 - 0:18:28.540000::Loan behold there was another Prius that had been parking in the parking lot
0:18:29.780000 - 0:18:33.420000::Legally, okay, and he thought that I was that guy
0:18:34.140000 - 0:18:42.860000::But I will just say that as soon as he kind of as soon as I made eye contact with him and he saw he got the neighborhood eye contact
0:18:42.860000 - 0:18:53.260000::Stair and sort of he felt my house superior my posture is right and sort of my body type and you know, Lanky
0:18:54.060000 - 0:18:56.060000::but powerful
0:18:56.940000 - 0:19:00.060000::Body type he would he would he immediately backed off
0:19:00.300000 - 0:19:06.140000::You know what I'm saying and felt and this was kind of like it felt like a sort of primate like
0:19:07.580000 - 0:19:13.420000::Sensing that the alpha sigma sort of thing like you can again you can't see these things through a glass
0:19:14.540000 - 0:19:20.060000::All right, you have a side to go. Yeah, right. There's a reasons why we shake hands and don't
0:19:21.580000 - 0:19:23.580000::You know what I mean?
0:19:24.220000 - 0:19:26.220000::You good
0:19:27.100000 - 0:19:29.100000::I don't but
0:19:30.300000 - 0:19:33.180000::But any of this skin tells you everything. I'll just say that
0:19:33.500000 - 0:19:40.540000::You get this skin this so much there's so much communication going going on intercellularly between hands when they shake
0:19:41.100000 - 0:19:46.780000::Tells you everything you need to know I'll just say right for anyone who's afraid to shake hands in this day and age
0:19:47.740000 - 0:19:49.740000::Start shaking them now
0:19:50.460000 - 0:19:55.180000::So that that's my or and what would you say the color of my order?
0:19:55.180000 - 0:19:59.980000::Because I think that's a thing of like people have different colors of or what would you say?

0:25:49.760000 - 0:25:53.120000::Was there anyone around or was that just coming to you from across the sea?
0:25:53.120000 - 0:25:54::He was talking
0:25:57.280000 - 0:25:59.280000::It traveled across the whole ocean
0:26:00.080000 - 0:26:03.440000::It bounced all the way. Can you imagine if that's how the earth worked sound-wise
0:26:04.320000 - 0:26:08.240000::It could we just haven't discovered those frictions yet. Well, probably that's what I bet
0:26:08.240000 - 0:26:11.760000::Yeah, I bet like groundhogs. Wait, do you guys watch the

0:26:38.720000 - 0:26:42.800000::They're like I mean, I don't know I really know nothing about physics
0:26:42.800000 - 0:26:45.600000::But they have all these like shapes that they're pulling out
0:26:45.600000 - 0:26:48::And take it to Howard as this like
0:26:49.200000 - 0:26:54.400000::This this model that he built in blender that he keeps on going back to you
0:26:54.400000 - 0:26:56.400000::And he said Jamie click on the color
0:26:58.800000 - 0:27:00.800000::It really making me laugh
0:27:02.080000 - 0:27:05.280000::I don't need to watch he's like he's like he's going back to it. He's like click on the
0:27:05.600000 - 0:27:07.600000::Click on the blue one
0:27:07.600000 - 0:27:09.600000::He just see me
0:27:11.760000 - 0:27:15.520000::It's so it's is a new shape that he's invented like a special
0:27:16.720000 - 0:27:19.520000::Yes, it's a new. He's like I invented this
0:27:20.400000 - 0:27:22.560000::This shape that he made in blender
0:27:22.560000 - 0:27:24.400000::Can I go it's just crazy
0:27:25.280000 - 0:27:28.960000::And then the the physicist is pulling out a different shape and he's like
0:27:29.680000 - 0:27:32.480000::referencing the this like toy
0:27:33.440000 - 0:27:35.440000::It's it's so chaotic
0:27:39.440000 - 0:27:42.080000::Uh, no, he's I think he came in like
0:27:43.040000 - 0:27:48.080000::I think he's like kind of pissed off because he's getting a lot of like attention for his
0:27:48.800000 - 0:27:52.560000::Formula's and stuff to the layman like people that don't know anything about physics
0:27:53.040000 - 0:27:55.920000::I think he's like mad that he is
0:27:57.040000 - 0:27:59.520000::You know getting traction for some of these
0:28:00.400000 - 0:28:04.240000::Theories that he has so he's like oh, I'm about to come in like he's
0:28:05.200000 - 0:28:12.880000::You can tell he's like studied all of like Terrence Howard's like ideas and he's like so ready to like
0:28:13.760000 - 0:28:18::To take it with him or not, you know, and he'd I think he does
0:28:18.160000 - 0:28:20.560000::And I didn't watch the whole thing but of what he
0:28:22.080000 - 0:28:27.360000::Of what I did watch he kind of is like trying to be as respectful as he can
0:28:28.080000 - 0:28:30.080000::But you know what I'm saying like
0:28:30.880000 - 0:28:34.720000::Terrence Howard has one he might be wrong about some things but like
0:28:35.840000 - 0:28:39.840000::I got to give him a massive shout out because you know one thing that he
0:28:40.960000 - 0:28:43.280000::There's got to be one thing that he's got right
0:28:44.080000 - 0:28:46.080000::You know what I'm saying right
0:28:46.640000 - 0:28:49.760000::Right and they're in and we could get into this
0:28:50.640000 - 0:28:58.160000::This is the academics versus the sort of the intuitives the intuitives right exactly
0:28:58.240000 - 0:29:03.840000::So I would say we are definitely intuitives you have to go through school and do all these and he's like no man
0:29:04.240000 - 0:29:06.240000::I'm just fucking no this is just what I'm feeling
0:29:06.720000 - 0:29:10.640000::There are people who discover and there are people who enforce
0:29:11.440000 - 0:29:12.240000::Uh
0:29:12.240000 - 0:29:20.720000::So if you are an academic like this gentleman was who came on to contest him and by the way in the stage in the process when we don't need people
0:29:20.720000 - 0:29:22.400000::Contesting it yet
0:29:22.400000 - 0:29:25.120000::Okay, right we need to get courage man
0:29:25.120000 - 0:29:31.120000::So what this math guy does is he goes and he learns everything that all the other crazy people had already discovered
0:29:31.760000 - 0:29:34.400000::And then he's teaching people this is what this person figured out
0:29:35.200000 - 0:29:39.200000::But what Terrence is doing is he's doing the the actual science, okay?
0:29:39.280000 - 0:29:42.240000::Which is making 3d models in blender then blender
0:29:42.800000 - 0:29:48.400000::In blender which most people don't have access to right the most you know that's a four that's at a kitchen appliance
0:29:48.400000 - 0:29:50.640000::But the problem with the all shape is designers
0:29:51.680000 - 0:29:55.520000::It's so it's every shape in one is I'm understanding it's called the all shape
0:29:56.240000 - 0:29:59.200000::Yeah, no it's not yeah, it's a triangle

0:30:00 - 0:30:07.200000::That looks like a basically a 12 dimensional crown interesting what's inside of this shape
0:30:07.840000 - 0:30:13.520000::Because it looks like a it looks like a wait are you serious Jack? That's like the whole discussion of did you
0:30:15.360000 - 0:30:19.160000::No, no because we're dealing with an indeed master intuitive right?
0:30:19.160000 - 0:30:23.320000::Wait, wait Jack did you did you really just like that's your first thought about it?
0:30:24.480000 - 0:30:28.880000::That's like that's like the whole premise of that's like his whole
0:30:28.880000 - 0:30:30.880000::He's like what's inside
0:30:35.960000 - 0:30:39.720000::Like that's where the all the energy comes from and
0:30:44.080000 - 0:30:50.160000::It's something that somebody somebody in the subredder someone was like this is just Jack like Jack is
0:30:51.320000 - 0:30:55.840000::This is a Jack like well if you look at if you look at it looks like
0:30:56.640000 - 0:31:00.600000::One of those spiky you know those like spiky type of things that fall out of trees
0:31:01.240000 - 0:31:06.240000::Mm-hmm looks kind of like one of those and it looks like
0:31:07.080000 - 0:31:12.520000::Clearly there's a nut in it. I mean really the funny thing is you are for anything inside of it
0:31:12.520000 - 0:31:18::Because you are the missing like link between Terrence Howard and like a
0:31:18.880000 - 0:31:22.960000::Like utopian discovery like if you guys could just well
0:31:22.960000 - 0:31:28.160000::Okay, so here's what I'm the guy because he could assess his what he needs somebody to come on who's gonna
0:31:28.480000 - 0:31:34.920000::Go there with him and just see because what I bet nobody said to him which I'm noticing just from looking at this thing
0:31:35.760000 - 0:31:38.400000::There's always a reason that something has a point
0:31:39.280000 - 0:31:42.720000::What's causing if you look at the crest of a wave in the ocean?
0:31:43.400000 - 0:31:46.840000::It's this a shape is a reaction to energy
0:31:47.080000 - 0:31:52.080000::So if you look at how many points are all around this dot around this ball
0:31:52.400000 - 0:31:58.640000::It's basically a bunch of tarps right and so it implies that there's something inside of this shape that is
0:32:00.360000 - 0:32:05.520000::Pushing out in very specific directions. I'm not gonna say north southeast west
0:32:05.520000 - 0:32:09.560000::I know Eric was talking about the east and west pole, but that's actually what
0:32:10.120000 - 0:32:16.720000::Weirdly it feels like a tight. It could be undiscovered fourth-dimensional directions. There's six points coming out of this thing
0:32:17.160000 - 0:32:21.480000::Okay, probably seven because there's one in the back that you can't see right
0:32:22.680000 - 0:32:25.100000::I mean it looks like a tent frankly looks like a circus tent
0:32:26.760000 - 0:32:33.440000::Imagine this you go you have a mysterious uncle who's always traveling, but you never know where and
0:32:34.720000 - 0:32:37.760000::One day he passes away and he leaves the chest to you
0:32:39.240000 - 0:32:42.080000::And you open the chest and there's a compass inside
0:32:43.080000 - 0:32:46.800000::But instead of just on a 2D plane where there's
0:32:47.440000 - 0:32:53.320000::What four cardinal directions he doesn't have a direct there's a direction coming no he singles whole life bachelor
0:32:53.560000 - 0:32:58.800000::There's a direction coming out towards you in a direction coming out away from you
0:33:00 - 0:33:02.640000::He's been navigating different dimensions. Yeah
0:33:03.480000 - 0:33:07.960000::Is that what you have this compass you can go to different dimensions and the compass
0:33:09.520000 - 0:33:16.160000::The physicist actually explained like other dimensions in a way that I like
0:33:17.080000 - 0:33:19.080000::kind of
0:33:19.200000 - 0:33:24.640000::Got any any any described it in a way that like you know how like a record like a
0:33:25.480000 - 0:33:27.480000::Old school record there's
0:33:28.520000 - 0:33:34.160000::He described as like there's the Victor L.a. What is that is that a record player or something?
0:33:34.160000 - 0:33:40.480000::Mm-hmm, and then he's like there's a you know the pin that you drop on you're listening to one song, okay?
0:33:40.480000 - 0:33:43.480000::That's our dimension. Okay, you're listening to
0:33:43.480000 - 0:33:45.480000::what's our
0:33:47.800000 - 0:33:54.560000::Anyways like you're listening to one song, okay on a record but on that record there's 12 songs
0:33:54.560000 - 0:34:02.320000::Okay, there's a different dimensions. Yeah, our reality is just on that so simultaneously on that record you can
0:34:04.480000 - 0:34:06.800000::All right, no, no, no literally
0:34:06.800000 - 0:34:08.800000::I'm saying I
0:34:09.200000 - 0:34:14.980000::Holy get it. I was like oh, that's that was a good way to describe. What do you mean other?
0:34:14.980000 - 0:34:20.080000::Dimit it's like simultaneously we exist in 11 dimensions, okay now
0:34:20.080000 - 0:34:28.360000::Here's my question. I'm simultaneously, but our our reality is just on that one, but does okay go Jack ask question
0:34:28.360000 - 0:34:30.360000::And I have another extremely important question
0:34:30.360000 - 0:34:35.840000::I just want to talk about this concept the notion of dimensions, okay?
0:34:36.800000 - 0:34:43::Because it feels like there's two things being talked about sometimes when you say it's a reality, right?
0:34:43.320000 - 0:34:49.440000::Because there's one dimension which is X there's the second dimension which is why this is peak joy tactics
0:34:54.240000 - 0:34:58.640000::Completely earnestly trying to break down what dimension is trying our hardest to understand

0:35:00 - 0:35:08.800000::So take take take me seriously X dimension one why that's actually still
0:35:08.800000 - 0:35:15.800000::dimension okay but in a blender that's a second dimension in terms of
0:35:15.800000 - 0:35:21::measure than Z space right that's a third dimension as we call this now
0:35:21 - 0:35:26.640000::actually I'm running into my own problem which is our X and Y not this is
0:35:26.640000 - 0:35:31.760000::we need a white board dude if we had a if we had a chalkboard dude it would be
0:35:31.760000 - 0:35:35.240000::we could create some equations we could well we're we're saying that's what
0:35:35.240000 - 0:35:37.960000::stopping us right now we don't have a fucking chalkboard we can write it
0:35:37.960000 - 0:35:42.020000::if we have a white part please do the whiteboard episode we all need to have
0:35:42.020000 - 0:35:47.280000::whiteboards hang them on the wall so that we can we need to have a gigantic
0:35:47.280000 - 0:35:53.100000::I'm getting like fucking wall yeah why calculations of calculation that we
0:35:53.100000 - 0:35:58.260000::keep up for the whole entirety of all joy tactics and we and it's gonna add up
0:35:58.260000 - 0:36:01.740000::to something dude of course we write down all of our equations that we've
0:36:01.740000 - 0:36:05.300000::been formulating this entire year here's my issue we would have something
0:36:05.300000 - 0:36:12.540000::okay let me do an example now this is a canister of Monoxidil I've never used
0:36:12.540000 - 0:36:18.540000::it and I don't even know what that is but this is one dimension okay right here
0:36:18.540000 - 0:36:24.980000::in terms of building why up and down this is another dimension across of course
0:36:24.980000 - 0:36:32.980000::this is another mention deep depth now my question is is that the same definition
0:36:32.980000 - 0:36:37.180000::of dimension as when you say a different dimension is a different reality
0:36:37.180000 - 0:36:45.580000::because a dimension is not a reality unless it is we are limiting ourselves with
0:36:45.580000 - 0:36:52.980000::the idea of a limited amount of multiples right well our brains can't figure
0:36:52.980000 - 0:36:57.260000::out because we haven't needed to figure this out evolution in an evolutionary
0:36:57.260000 - 0:37:01.500000::from an evolutionary standpoint is the concept of infinity these you know I'm
0:37:01.500000 - 0:37:06.940000::so great right because the way that that physicists put it for you helps our
0:37:06.940000 - 0:37:10.500000::small brains understand oh there's 12 dimensions we're all on the same
0:37:10.500000 - 0:37:15.220000::physical we're on different physical plane something like that but we can't
0:37:15.220000 - 0:37:19.220000::comprehend the amount of possibilities something like Dr. Strange would be able
0:37:19.220000 - 0:37:25.860000::to comprehend okay because if anybody's gonna comprehend the concept the notion of
0:37:25.860000 - 0:37:33.700000::interdimensional reality it's Dr. Strange right because he has his he has his
0:37:33.700000 - 0:37:40.100000::windows to other dimensions he's seen more than you can imagine Dr. Strange
0:37:40.100000 - 0:37:45.540000::that's an awesome doctor weird doctor understanding doctor
0:37:45.540000 - 0:37:51.500000::understanding empathetic well so I just googled the word dimension there's two
0:37:51.500000 - 0:37:57.700000::definitions the first a measurable extent of some kind such as length breath
0:37:57.700000 - 0:38:05.300000::fuck is that depth or the fuck is breath breath is like with no because
0:38:05.300000 - 0:38:09.820000::that that I see what you're saying they're saying length no I still that's how
0:38:09.820000 - 0:38:14.980000::like all time he's sailor would say with but there's four there's wind and
0:38:14.980000 - 0:38:23.940000::breath length length okay but but then it says height at the end length breath
0:38:23.940000 - 0:38:31.780000::depth length maybe we need to move on we need to move on now the sound by
0:38:31.780000 - 0:38:38.160000::I would be pressing that like you can even hear joy day joy day joy day joy
0:38:38.160000 - 0:38:42.180000::day joy day all right now the second definition is an aspect or feature of a
0:38:42.180000 - 0:38:46.660000::situation problem or thing fluffy reveal sun the example it does is sun dried
0:38:46.660000 - 0:38:51.700000::tomatoes add a new dimension to this sauce so that's irrelevant for what we're
0:38:51.700000 - 0:38:58.980000::talking about look at that cat that's a cute cat so do you think animals this
0:38:58.980000 - 0:39:05.420000::is a great serendipitous moment do you think that animals exist in another
0:39:05.420000 - 0:39:10.940000::dimension in their minds because they are in the they perceive it I feel like
0:39:10.940000 - 0:39:16.980000::they are we think that they're stupid as fuck or at least I do right and no
0:39:16.980000 - 0:39:22.380000::it convinced me that they're smarter than humans in any way shape or form but
0:39:22.380000 - 0:39:27.540000::sometimes the way that they just stare into the distance birds they're just
0:39:27.540000 - 0:39:32.700000::they're just dude you can't just you can't just plant you can't just be still and
0:39:32.700000 - 0:39:38.260000::just freeze like that without going to a different having something quite deep
0:39:38.260000 - 0:39:45.060000::going on in there I know I know that's for sure well maybe my question is this
0:39:45.060000 - 0:39:50.400000::back to the idea of Laura so in this dimension we all have some of the
0:39:50.400000 - 0:39:56.220000::each one of us has an amazing very powerful aura that coincides with our
0:39:56.220000 - 0:40:00.060000::high levels of success career-wise in relationship with

0:40:00 - 0:40:08.100000::whatever does that or extend to other dimensions. For example, did Jesus Christ's
0:40:08.100000 - 0:40:14.320000::aura on this planet and this reality extend through all the other
0:40:14.320000 - 0:40:23.440000::dimensions. So in dimension 49,000 a.m. whatever. Jesus in that reality, some type of
0:40:23.440000 - 0:40:31.800000::wherever frog or whatever that has that same aura and that same impact on on the
0:40:31.800000 - 0:40:38.980000::history of that reality. Yes, the extent. Yes, because you have a when you drop a
0:40:38.980000 - 0:40:45.200000::rock into the ocean, it creates a ripple not just along the top, but it also
0:40:45.200000 - 0:40:52.240000::creates ripples down throughout the ocean. So it's almost like if we're living in
0:40:52.240000 - 0:40:57.140000::these three dimensions, which we may perceive even though we can only perceive
0:40:57.140000 - 0:41:01.640000::one with our individual eyes, which does lead me to believe that we see in
0:41:01.640000 - 0:41:05.940000::three dimensions because to be able to see from beyond one dimension, you need to
0:41:05.940000 - 0:41:09.840000::have two lenses, which are communicating to your brain at the same time and we
0:41:09.840000 - 0:41:14.040000::do have two lenses. It's just we see in 3D at such a microscopic and
0:41:14.040000 - 0:41:19.800000::Lee close. You guys already know this shit. But what I'm saying is yeah, they
0:41:19.800000 - 0:41:23.920000::notice because when you walk under a ladder and you're thinking, oh, that's a bad
0:41:23.920000 - 0:41:28.480000::luck. Well, what you've actually done is you piss somebody off because they use
0:41:28.480000 - 0:41:31.400000::that interdimensional space to keep their food there and you just walk through a
0:41:31.400000 - 0:41:37.960000::bunch of cans of we need or whatever. See what I'm saying? You break glass. Yeah.
0:41:37.960000 - 0:41:45.280000::On a major catastrophic level, I believe that when we did the
0:41:45.280000 - 0:41:52.320000::Oppenheimer nuclear tests and the bombs, splitting the atom has a major impact
0:41:52.320000 - 0:42:00.200000::on other dimensions. That's what they say. Because why? There was so much of you at
0:42:00.200000 - 0:42:04.400000::what we what we would call UFO activity happening right after the nuclear
0:42:04.400000 - 0:42:10.040000::bombs. I think it's because we triggered a watchdog a watchdog group a
0:42:10.040000 - 0:42:15.720000::neighborhood watch or an electric and a neighborhood watch that was like, oh,
0:42:15.720000 - 0:42:19.920000::shit, we got to now pay attention to these fools. Last we have another
0:42:19.920000 - 0:42:25.640000::I think in the rise. Well, you know what's in Roswell, New Mexico. What is the is the
0:42:25.640000 - 0:42:34.080000::fucking the Hong Kong of the fifth dimension is like crazy. Located a crazy
0:42:34.080000 - 0:42:39.360000::interdimensional city is kind of based in that location. So when we put off that
0:42:39.360000 - 0:42:47.960000::whatever that first bomb went off, it I feel like it was massive. You know,
0:42:47.960000 - 0:42:53.560000::trillions of entities were killed in that interdimensional. And they were like,
0:42:53.560000 - 0:42:59.840000::what the fuck is going on? Oh my god. There's no way those fools and those primates in the
0:42:59.840000 - 0:43:05.080000::third dimension. We got to go, well, there's no way they they come back. Hey,
0:43:05.080000 - 0:43:09.360000::what the fuck are you serious? They've developed this technology. They haven't
0:43:09.360000 - 0:43:13.480000::been here in probably 200,000 years. They thought they thought they thought
0:43:13.480000 - 0:43:17.240000::we're just you coconuts, right? They thought it was cute. What we were doing.
0:43:17.240000 - 0:43:22.960000::Whoops, we found a microchip. Whoopsies. Whoopsies. We found a PlayStation now.
0:43:22.960000 - 0:43:29.760000::Oops. Yeah, we thought you left a bunch of atoms here. We have a switch. Yep.
0:43:29.760000 - 0:43:35.800000::Sorry. Whoops. Sorry, alien captors. We can podcast now. We can broadcast.
0:43:35.800000 - 0:43:41.840000::What the fuck? It's too late. It's too late. We're already echoing the reverberation
0:43:41.840000 - 0:43:51.160000::out podcasting. That's a fucking yeah. Now, how do you grow up with that or cope with that?
0:43:51.160000 - 0:44:04.840000::Grapple. Grapple. How do you grapple with that theory, Nate, given the amount of
0:44:04.840000 - 0:44:10.640000::bombs which have gone off because let's not forget the Tsasar Bomba, which went
0:44:10.640000 - 0:44:16.640000::off in the Northern Russian Islands or Hiroshima and Nagasaki. I hate to bring them up,
0:44:16.640000 - 0:44:24.560000::but many bombs have gone off. Are you saying that these places are also kind of doorways
0:44:24.560000 - 0:44:29.120000::like those are like those are like the Dayton, Ohio's of the other dimension where they're
0:44:29.120000 - 0:44:35.040000::like whatever. Like they blew up Dayton, Ohio. If you blew up Dayton, Ohio, you'd be like whatever.
0:44:35.040000 - 0:44:40.880000::Okay, but it was a spot where Roswell was. It was it was just like right place, right times.
0:44:40.880000 - 0:44:48::Where like what the fuck you blew up the New York City of the six dimension man. That's
0:44:48 - 0:44:54.880000::not cool. We got to fly around. So the way that I'm understanding this is there is one
0:44:54.880000 - 0:45:00::universal grid. There is one black and green like you would see in like a night.

0:45:00 - 0:45:03.680000::1990s computer rendering grid of the universe, right?
0:45:03.680000 - 0:45:04.680000::Yeah.
0:45:04.680000 - 0:45:08.680000::And every reality in dimension is like a ROM
0:45:08.680000 - 0:45:10.080000::that you're playing on that grid.
0:45:10.080000 - 0:45:12.760000::Like, OK, there's Pokemon, Yellow on this one.
0:45:12.760000 - 0:45:17.200000::We're playing whatever Chrono trigger on this one.
0:45:17.200000 - 0:45:19.600000::We're playing Banja Kazooie on this grid.
0:45:19.600000 - 0:45:21.480000::So the grid is the same.
0:45:21.480000 - 0:45:22.760000::The console is the same.
0:45:22.760000 - 0:45:23.720000::Do you see what I'm saying?
0:45:23.720000 - 0:45:24.960000::You're playing it on the same.
0:45:24.960000 - 0:45:27.240000::We're all playing on the same N64.
0:45:27.240000 - 0:45:30.840000::It's just the games are all different.
0:45:30.840000 - 0:45:33.920000::And if you blow up something all crazy in one game
0:45:33.920000 - 0:45:37.800000::and start messing with the console,
0:45:37.800000 - 0:45:38.640000::yeah, guess what?
0:45:38.640000 - 0:45:41.080000::That has a trickle down effect on the other dimensions.
0:45:41.080000 - 0:45:43.960000::Yeah, let me bring up a game that it would be highly related
0:45:43.960000 - 0:45:45.880000::to this subject.
0:45:45.880000 - 0:45:47.760000::You remember Mario, right?
0:45:47.760000 - 0:45:48.360000::Which one?
0:45:48.360000 - 0:45:50.120000::I remember him.
0:45:50.120000 - 0:45:50.920000::OK.
0:45:50.920000 - 0:45:53.840000::Now you remember Paper Mario.
0:45:53.840000 - 0:45:54.080000::Yep.
0:45:54.080000 - 0:45:54.960000::2D to 3.
0:45:54.960000 - 0:45:55.960000::Oh.
0:45:55.960000 - 0:45:59::I remember he went, he shrunk him down to a different,
0:45:59 - 0:46:03.040000::he went into Mario went interdimensional with it.
0:46:03.040000 - 0:46:06.120000::He said, I want to figure out this flat reality
0:46:06.120000 - 0:46:07.120000::and see what that's like.
0:46:07.120000 - 0:46:09.320000::Is the princess going to be sexier?
0:46:09.320000 - 0:46:10.520000::All sexier still?
0:46:10.520000 - 0:46:11.040000::Right.
0:46:11.040000 - 0:46:11.760000::Yep.
0:46:11.760000 - 0:46:12.560000::And she was.
0:46:12.560000 - 0:46:13.280000::Turns out she was.
0:46:13.280000 - 0:46:14.480000::Turns out she was.
0:46:14.480000 - 0:46:15.560000::Even sexier.
0:46:15.560000 - 0:46:20.440000::When I'm paper, you're going.
0:46:20.440000 - 0:46:25.720000::But when you're not paper, yeah, well, yeah.
0:46:25.720000 - 0:46:29.120000::Are we still able to do this when we turn 40?
0:46:29.120000 - 0:46:31.320000::When you hit 40, is this going to feel different when
0:46:31.320000 - 0:46:33.640000::we're talking about this?
0:46:33.640000 - 0:46:34.480000::Or is this a...
0:46:34.480000 - 0:46:37.040000::First of all, I'll be dead by then, so I won't even know.
0:46:37.040000 - 0:46:38.880000::Well, you saw there was a Reddit poll about who's
0:46:38.880000 - 0:46:41.200000::going to die first tonight.
0:46:41.200000 - 0:46:42.560000::I won by a landslide.
0:46:42.560000 - 0:46:45.560000::That's it.
0:46:45.560000 - 0:46:47.280000::Now, that was a leading question.
0:46:47.280000 - 0:46:48.800000::That's called a leading question.
0:46:48.800000 - 0:46:49.320000::Yeah.
0:46:49.320000 - 0:46:51.600000::That's just who, that's all people who want to kill you.
0:46:51.600000 - 0:46:52.520000::You know what I'm saying?
0:46:52.520000 - 0:46:54.360000::They want me dead for that.
0:46:54.360000 - 0:46:55.520000::They want you dead.
0:46:55.520000 - 0:46:56.360000::They want to stop.
0:46:56.360000 - 0:46:57.360000::They want to stop.
0:46:57.360000 - 0:47:01.480000::They want to stop innovation in the entertainment industry,
0:47:01.480000 - 0:47:01.920000::then.
0:47:01.920000 - 0:47:03.200000::That's the goal.
0:47:03.200000 - 0:47:04.280000::That's right.
0:47:04.280000 - 0:47:07.520000::No.
0:47:07.520000 - 0:47:08.600000::Jesus.
0:47:13 - 0:47:15.480000::Yeah, I do.
0:47:15.480000 - 0:47:18.160000::I know there's so much innovation that you have, Eric,
0:47:18.160000 - 0:47:20.560000::that they're really thinking about.
0:47:20.560000 - 0:47:21.920000::They're thinking well of innovation
0:47:21.920000 - 0:47:23.960000::that people will be missing out.
0:47:23.960000 - 0:47:28.080000::If I go, if I go too, really.
0:47:28.080000 - 0:47:32.600000::Man, so let's give some advice on how you can really quickly
0:47:32.600000 - 0:47:35.680000::give some advice on how a young person could increase their aura.
0:47:35.680000 - 0:47:38.320000::Because you know this is the new, this is the new tip.com.
0:47:38.320000 - 0:47:38.840000::You want points.
0:47:38.840000 - 0:47:42.200000::People can say like, oh, I sense this person's aura.
0:47:42.200000 - 0:47:45.600000::Five videos away on my four-year page, whatever, the tip.
0:47:45.600000 - 0:47:46.600000::Right.
0:47:46.600000 - 0:47:50.240000::So if you're a young person and you're aurelist,
0:47:50.240000 - 0:47:51.080000::get it together.
0:47:51.080000 - 0:47:53.640000::Here's how you do it.
0:47:53.640000 - 0:47:57.320000::If you're in a picture, if you're posing in a picture,
0:47:57.320000 - 0:47:58.880000::and you're standing next to someone,
0:47:58.880000 - 0:48:02.400000::never point at the person like this and look away.
0:48:02.400000 - 0:48:03.320000::Like that.
0:48:03.320000 - 0:48:04.320000::Never do that.
0:48:04.320000 - 0:48:05.160000::No.
0:48:05.160000 - 0:48:07.160000::So you're saying you can change your aura.
0:48:07.160000 - 0:48:07.960000::Go like this.
0:48:07.960000 - 0:48:11::Well, it's a constant measuring.
0:48:11 - 0:48:12.520000::Right.
0:48:12.520000 - 0:48:17.440000::So you are constantly every second of your life doing things
0:48:17.440000 - 0:48:18.560000::like a stock market.
0:48:18.560000 - 0:48:19.400000::It's going up.
0:48:19.400000 - 0:48:20.240000::It's going up.
0:48:20.240000 - 0:48:21.360000::It's going up.
0:48:21.360000 - 0:48:22.600000::So you just have to do things.
0:48:22.600000 - 0:48:24.520000::You might be starting at a place right now
0:48:24.520000 - 0:48:27.840000::where you're in ninth grade as many the listeners are.
0:48:27.840000 - 0:48:30.760000::And you're at a negative 40,000 aura.
0:48:30.760000 - 0:48:32.600000::So just to even get you got work to do,
0:48:32.600000 - 0:48:35.440000::you can't just do, if you think you could pull off
0:48:35.440000 - 0:48:37.560000::a max, Keaple's big move style back
0:48:37.560000 - 0:48:40.840000::with Boffa Table, 900,000 plus aura points in one move.
0:48:40.840000 - 0:48:41.840000::Sure.
0:48:41.840000 - 0:48:43.440000::But for a lot of people, that's dangerous.
0:48:43.440000 - 0:48:44.280000::You could kill.
0:48:44.280000 - 0:48:48::You could, well, you could, it's a full-on gamble
0:48:48 - 0:48:51.160000::because you could lose 900,000 aura just like that.
0:48:51.240000 - 0:48:55.800000::And now you're really starting from now on, say, salvageable.
0:48:55.800000 - 0:48:57.400000::That's when the interest starts racking up
0:48:57.400000 - 0:48:58.480000::on the aura points.
0:48:58.480000 - 0:49:00.080000::Then you just become a NPC.
0:49:00.080000 - 0:49:00.960000::You exactly.
0:49:03.480000 - 0:49:07.520000::So do things like, you know, listen, do the double kiss
0:49:07.520000 - 0:49:08.360000::on the cheek.
0:49:08.360000 - 0:49:11.840000::I forgot there was a numerical value associated with.
0:49:11.840000 - 0:49:13.200000::Of course there is.
0:49:13.200000 - 0:49:15.560000::There's numerical values associated with everything
0:49:15.560000 - 0:49:16.600000::if you look deeply enough.
0:49:16.600000 - 0:49:19.080000::There's math and everything.
0:49:19.080000 - 0:49:20.120000::That's the beauty of math.
0:49:20.120000 - 0:49:21.800000::There's math and art you realize.
0:49:21.800000 - 0:49:24.400000::I had no idea math could be beautiful.
0:49:24.400000 - 0:49:26.200000::There's math and phone numbers.
0:49:26.200000 - 0:49:28.680000::There's numbers and phone numbers.
0:49:28.680000 - 0:49:29.680000::Right.
0:49:29.680000 - 0:49:30.680000::Right.
0:49:30.680000 - 0:49:35.320000::I hate to do this, but basically I have to go pick up a table.
0:49:35.320000 - 0:49:36.520000::I don't tell you guys about this.
0:49:36.520000 - 0:49:38.200000::I actually go pick up a table.
0:49:38.200000 - 0:49:40.960000::So unfortunately, we need to kick our joys off a little
0:49:40.960000 - 0:49:41.480000::of this table.
0:49:41.480000 - 0:49:42.200000::Who's Jedi table?
0:49:42.200000 - 0:49:43.800000::It's your lightsaber table.
0:49:43.800000 - 0:49:44.320000::Go ahead.
0:49:44.320000 - 0:49:45::Yeah.
0:49:45 - 0:49:46.840000::Put your hands on it.
0:49:46.840000 - 0:49:49.520000::Lay on it.
0:49:49.520000 - 0:49:50.360000::Your massage.
0:49:50.360000 - 0:49:51.840000::You're like a masseuse.
0:49:51.840000 - 0:49:52.360000::A gypsy.
0:49:52.360000 - 0:49:53.360000::Light chair.
0:49:53.360000 - 0:49:53.880000::Go ahead.
0:49:53.880000 - 0:49:55.360000::Get on the table.
