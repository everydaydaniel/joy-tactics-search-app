0:01:06.720000 - 0:01:11.920000::called homes, right? This is where you live. If you're fortunate enough to have a
0:01:11.920000 - 0:01:15.960000::home, this is where you live. It's where you sleep. It's often where you eat.
0:01:15.960000 - 0:01:21.720000::That's where your family lives, your pets. But what do you do if you go on the road?
0:01:22.600000 - 0:01:25.800000::You're traveling, you're doing sold out shows across the country.
0:01:25.800000 - 0:01:30.840000::You're doing medical tourism, whatever. Where do you stay then? Which cut? Yeah.
0:01:30.840000 - 0:01:37.240000::You don't have a home there. So what you have to do is stay at another type of place,
0:01:37.240000 - 0:01:43.800000::which is what they call hotels. Should you be so lucky? Should you be so lucky?
0:01:43.800000 - 0:01:49.400000::Now that's what I say at the end of we are a little peak behind the curtain.
0:01:49.400000 - 0:01:53.560000::All three of us do stand-up comedy. Okay. It cuts out of the bag. That's true. We do.
0:01:53.560000 - 0:01:58.040000::And we're crushing it. Okay. And it's nothing to be ashamed of. So we're crushing it
0:01:58.040000 - 0:02:04.040000::credibly. So you couldn't imagine types of 45 tickets we do and Seattle stuff like that.
0:02:04.040000 - 0:02:07.080000::Yeah. Right. And that's not even a little bit more than that.
0:02:07.080000 - 0:02:11.480000::To be just let's just be honest. Okay. But one of the shows was about 45 people.
0:02:11.480000 - 0:02:16.440000::One of the shows is the 45 after 98 people saw that first show. You know what?
0:02:16.440000 - 0:02:20.200000::You know I just thought of this now. You know how people like put out a poster and it's like
0:02:20.840000 - 0:02:26.600000::this like fucking 50 city tour with and it says like sold out sold out and you're like damn like
0:02:26.600000 - 0:02:33.160000::they're really like selling tickets. You could do one of those tours but have a venue with a
0:02:33.160000 - 0:02:38.440000::capacity of like two people and you should look like you're selling out show. Well you could do
0:02:38.440000 - 0:02:44.920000::a country. Why don't you do in-call comedy? The in-call comedy club. Yeah just I'll go to your room.
0:02:45.720000 - 0:02:51.160000::You have your friends over. There's a video of like shine down or like one of those really
0:02:52.120000 - 0:02:57.640000::POD type of bands or something that does like WWE genre rock. There's a video of them on YouTube
0:02:57.640000 - 0:03:01.880000::doing like an acoustic set for a bunch of people in like the early 2000s in like brown
0:03:01.880000 - 0:03:07.080000::early hoodies. And listening to them just like rock out in their apartment. Smoking

0:03:13.480000 - 0:03:19.800000::Whatever that is. Oh no you would love so far sounds dude. So far sounds is a way to bring
0:03:19.800000 - 0:03:26.120000::music back to smaller boats. This is what remember remember that guy that lived below us in Chicago
0:03:26.120000 - 0:03:34.440000::named Dink. Yeah. Remember Dink. Meryley. Dude you would remember Dink. He would he would throw
0:03:34.440000 - 0:03:39.560000::so far sounds shows and his apartment basically so far sounds. Just how to show for apartments for
0:03:39.560000 - 0:03:50.280000::house show. Is this like an opening? It's a movement. Okay dude. Oh man. You're so
0:03:50.280000 - 0:03:55.640000::talented. So movements and I don't like to yeah right I am. I don't like to brag about that though.
0:03:58.040000 - 0:04:03.960000::So what what I'm saying is and what you guys are saying is well well what no what I was going to
0:04:03.960000 - 0:04:10.200000::say is about doing stand up to tie it back in is that a lot of people say get home safe. Okay.
0:04:10.200000 - 0:04:17.240000::What do I like to say? I like to say but and then once you're at home be safe at home because a lot
0:04:17.240000 - 0:04:23.480000::of people a lot of people who getting home getting home is the safest part of the drive the safest
0:04:23.480000 - 0:04:26.680000::part of your day. Sometimes the most sometimes the safest place you got is the most dangerous place
0:04:26.680000 - 0:04:32.440000::you'll ever be. That's what I'm saying again. That hits home so hard it makes me emotional almost
0:04:32.520000 - 0:04:36.600000::to hear that. Well look at you right now because you're in a hotel and I know that you were there's a
0:04:36.600000 - 0:04:44.120000::bunch of you know Airbnb's that all your friends are staying in right now but because of your violent
0:04:44.120000 - 0:04:51.960000::tendencies it wouldn't allow you to stay with them. Can you do a hotel review right now of your
0:04:52.600000 - 0:04:56.840000::current hotel that you're in? Let me throw it down like this. I don't want to expose anybody.
0:04:56.840000 - 0:04:59.960000::This is just how it goes sometimes but we are still

0:05:00 - 0:05:04.040000::saying, and this will be, this festival will be over by the time this comes out.
0:05:04.040000 - 0:05:05.560000::So I'm not doxing anybody.
0:05:05.560000 - 0:05:09.680000::We are staying in a hotel called the Thompson, okay?
0:05:09.680000 - 0:05:10.680000::Sarah Sherman is here.
0:05:10.680000 - 0:05:11.680000::Sure, in Austin, Texas.
0:05:11.680000 - 0:05:12.680000::In Austin, Texas.
0:05:12.680000 - 0:05:13.680000::Now here's what's here.
0:05:13.680000 - 0:05:19.280000::Dave, we are constantly being divided by class everywhere we go, whether we like it
0:05:19.280000 - 0:05:20.280000::or not.
0:05:20.280000 - 0:05:21.280000::So here's what happens.
0:05:21.280000 - 0:05:23.280000::Sarah, what hotel are you staying at?
0:05:23.280000 - 0:05:24.680000::I'm staying at the Thompson.
0:05:24.680000 - 0:05:29.960000::And I said, that's interesting because I'm staying at a place called the Tommy.
0:05:29.960000 - 0:05:31.680000::Yeah, listen to this.
0:05:31.680000 - 0:05:36.960000::Apparently what they've done is they have something called the Tommy, which is much smaller
0:05:36.960000 - 0:05:40.160000::rooms, the toilets in the shower.
0:05:40.160000 - 0:05:43.600000::Basically, the desk is on the sink right here.
0:05:43.600000 - 0:05:48.120000::It's a little bit cramped for the lower level comedians.
0:05:48.120000 - 0:05:51.320000::For if you're on SNL or whatever, you have.
0:05:51.320000 - 0:05:53.560000::Why are you here?
0:05:53.560000 - 0:05:55.600000::Why are you in the...
0:05:55.600000 - 0:05:57.480000::There must have been a clerical error.
0:05:58.480000 - 0:05:59.480000::It's whatever.
0:05:59.480000 - 0:06:03.600000::But the higher profile comedians go to this place called the Thompson, which is, I was
0:06:03.600000 - 0:06:08.400000::in Sarah's room, I should have full couch, full black toilet.
0:06:08.400000 - 0:06:12.280000::It's not in the shower, mini bar.
0:06:12.280000 - 0:06:15.440000::This is how revolutions begin.
0:06:15.440000 - 0:06:17.440000::Is little discoveries like this.
0:06:17.440000 - 0:06:18.760000::You know what I'm saying?
0:06:18.760000 - 0:06:21.840000::Being smacked in some place called the Tommy.
0:06:21.840000 - 0:06:27.280000::When the richy richy gets to go to the Thompson, I won't stand for that.
0:06:27.280000 - 0:06:29.280000::No, here's what I'll say, man.
0:06:29.280000 - 0:06:31.680000::This is, let's stick to this.
0:06:31.680000 - 0:06:38.600000::As soon as we go public with joy tactics, right now, we haven't pushed it publicly much,
0:06:38.600000 - 0:06:41.720000::but once this thing goes out, it looks like you're drinking shampoo.
0:06:41.720000 - 0:06:42.720000::What is that water bottle?
0:06:42.720000 - 0:06:43.720000::Yeah, that is kind of...
0:06:43.720000 - 0:06:48.720000::That's very funny to make fun of oxygen and rich purified water called C.A.L.
0:06:48.720000 - 0:06:49.720000::Fuck is that?
0:06:49.720000 - 0:06:50.720000::How much do you have?
0:06:50.720000 - 0:06:51.960000::They do it different in Austin.
0:06:51.960000 - 0:06:52.960000::How much was this?
0:06:52.960000 - 0:06:54.960000::Two seventy five.
0:06:54.960000 - 0:06:57.040000::That looks like an eight dollar water.
0:06:57.080000 - 0:06:58.760000::I know I bought it thinking it was...
0:06:58.760000 - 0:06:59.760000::It looks like soap.
0:06:59.760000 - 0:07:00.760000::Is it metal?
0:07:00.760000 - 0:07:02.760000::Or is it a dish that's plastic?
0:07:02.760000 - 0:07:03.760000::It's blue plastic.
0:07:03.760000 - 0:07:06.280000::It's blue plastic.
0:07:06.280000 - 0:07:08.400000::We love water bottles under attack decks.
0:07:08.400000 - 0:07:14.480000::So what I'm saying is, once we do finally get to the levels of success, which are incoming,
0:07:14.480000 - 0:07:18.440000::faster than fucking asteroid on crack, basically, what I'm saying is...
0:07:18.440000 - 0:07:20.240000::What I'm saying is...
0:07:20.240000 - 0:07:24.400000::And asteroid, by the way, is basically one giant, intergalactic crack rock.
0:07:24.400000 - 0:07:25.400000::That's what's also important to me.
0:07:25.440000 - 0:07:26.440000::That's right.
0:07:26.440000 - 0:07:28.440000::Smoking a whole asteroid.
0:07:28.440000 - 0:07:30.840000::That's basically what the sun is doing.
0:07:30.840000 - 0:07:32.840000::The sun is free-basing.
0:07:32.840000 - 0:07:33.840000::So oxygen.
0:07:33.840000 - 0:07:35.840000::That's right.
0:07:35.840000 - 0:07:36.840000::Well, there's no...
0:07:36.840000 - 0:07:39.360000::Well, it destroys water on the channel.
0:07:39.360000 - 0:07:41.160000::It will just figure it out later.
0:07:41.160000 - 0:07:44.240000::Okay, so what I'm saying is...
0:07:44.240000 - 0:07:47.520000::Joy tactics, I can't remember what I was talking about.
0:07:47.520000 - 0:07:48.520000::That's fine.
0:07:48.520000 - 0:07:49.520000::We can move on.
0:07:49.520000 - 0:07:50.520000::Hotels.
0:07:50.520000 - 0:07:54.520000::What we're covering this episode is hotels in the hospice town, hospitality industry.
0:07:54.520000 - 0:08:02.760000::And we want to get to the power.
0:08:02.760000 - 0:08:05.840000::Can I give people out there a practical...
0:08:05.840000 - 0:08:11.080000::Because a lot of people listen to this, and they can't walk away from this podcast with
0:08:11.080000 - 0:08:16.480000::any nugget of knowledge or something that they've learned.
0:08:16.480000 - 0:08:20.600000::You know, they walk away with nothing often from what's podcast.
0:08:20.600000 - 0:08:21.600000::Okay.
0:08:21.600000 - 0:08:23.400000::And I know you guys will disagree with that.
0:08:23.400000 - 0:08:30.280000::Whatever you guys are going to say, they walk away with having amazing conversations and
0:08:30.280000 - 0:08:31.280000::this better their day.
0:08:31.280000 - 0:08:33.680000::Made them happier.
0:08:33.680000 - 0:08:36.120000::But I'm trying to give people something practical.
0:08:36.120000 - 0:08:37.480000::This is real.
0:08:37.480000 - 0:08:40.240000::Check for bedbugs in your hotel.
0:08:40.240000 - 0:08:41.240000::Okay.
0:08:41.240000 - 0:08:44.320000::If you're staring at a Marriott, and this is what you do, you go into the corner.
0:08:44.320000 - 0:08:45.320000::Bedroom bugs.
0:08:45.320000 - 0:08:49.120000::Lift up the fitted sheet.
0:08:49.120000 - 0:08:50.120000::Okay.
0:08:50.120000 - 0:08:52.680000::And go into the corner of the mattress.
0:08:52.680000 - 0:08:53.680000::The corners.
0:08:53.680000 - 0:08:54.680000::That's where they...
0:08:54.680000 - 0:08:56.320000::That's where you can see them.
0:08:56.320000 - 0:08:57.320000::Okay.
0:08:57.320000 - 0:08:59.520000::And just check the corners for bedbugs.
0:08:59.520000 - 0:09:00.520000::That's my practical tip.
0:09:00.520000 - 0:09:03.760000::Let's go back to the amazing conversations and comments.
0:09:03.760000 - 0:09:05.400000::Let me piggyback on that.
0:09:05.400000 - 0:09:06.400000::Let me piggyback on that.
0:09:06.400000 - 0:09:08.320000::Practical tip number two.
0:09:08.320000 - 0:09:10.320000::Then go...
0:09:10.320000 - 0:09:13::There's a TV on a cabinet.
0:09:13 - 0:09:16.240000::Take the TV off.
0:09:16.240000 - 0:09:18.240000::Post on Craigslist.
0:09:18.240000 - 0:09:22.440000::Toe Shiba, LG, Flash screen, blah blah blah.
0:09:22.440000 - 0:09:24.680000::Sell that thing, shoot 70 bucks.
0:09:24.680000 - 0:09:28.320000::Then what you do is you go to Costco.
0:09:28.320000 - 0:09:33.080000::You replace it with an identical TV that is much cheaper than you're walking away with
0:09:33.080000 - 0:09:36.120000::at least 20, 39.
0:09:36.120000 - 0:09:38.240000::And check for quarters, by the way.
0:09:38.240000 - 0:09:39.840000::Look behind the drawer.
0:09:39.840000 - 0:09:42::There's usually a quarter to right there.
0:09:42 - 0:09:43::What's that?
0:09:43 - 0:09:44.600000::A fraction of nothing, right?
0:09:44.600000 - 0:09:45.600000::No.
0:09:45.600000 - 0:09:46.600000::That's nearly checks mix.
0:09:46.600000 - 0:09:49.840000::And a lot of people would fucking kill their family members just for one of them brown
0:09:49.840000 - 0:09:52.760000::crispy things everybody talks shit about.
0:09:52.760000 - 0:09:56.720000::So what I was going to say is that I just remembered.
0:09:56.720000 - 0:10:00.040000::I don't think that if given the opportunity to stay in the Thompson

0:10:00 - 0:10:02.560000::that I would fucking stay there.
0:10:02.560000 - 0:10:03.560000::Right.
0:10:03.560000 - 0:10:04.560000::Because of your class.
0:10:04.560000 - 0:10:05.560000::To be quite frank.
0:10:05.560000 - 0:10:06.560000::Class solidarity.
0:10:06.560000 - 0:10:07.560000::Solidarity.
0:10:07.560000 - 0:10:08.560000::Right.
0:10:08.560000 - 0:10:15.240000::Because I'm literally, if I see somebody, I can't think of an analogy, but something like
0:10:15.240000 - 0:10:20.040000::if I bought a sandwich and somebody behind me but a sandwich and they didn't have avocado
0:10:20.040000 - 0:10:23.840000::on it and I did, I'd say dude put avocado on that right now.
0:10:23.840000 - 0:10:29::If I see somebody in line, I go out to a Chipotle rather and they don't get guacamole, I go
0:10:29 - 0:10:32.120000::to do what you've been, it's guac day.
0:10:32.120000 - 0:10:33.120000::Wow.
0:10:33.120000 - 0:10:34.960000::So, so what I'm saying.
0:10:34.960000 - 0:10:38.720000::Yeah, I'm feeling kind of, because if I were Sarah, I would be fucking fighting for my
0:10:38.720000 - 0:10:41.120000::life for me to get into the Thompson room.
0:10:41.120000 - 0:10:43.320000::Oh, for, you know what I'm saying?
0:10:43.320000 - 0:10:44.320000::What are you saying?
0:10:44.320000 - 0:10:47.240000::If I were Sarah, I would be fighting for me, her close friend.
0:10:47.240000 - 0:10:48.240000::Oh, I see.
0:10:48.240000 - 0:10:49.240000::Also be where she is.
0:10:49.240000 - 0:10:50.960000::And yet I haven't heard of Pete from her about this.
0:10:50.960000 - 0:10:53.400000::Have you, have you seen any question her?
0:10:53.400000 - 0:10:56.720000::You said you've seen the rooms in this nice hotel.
0:10:56.720000 - 0:10:57.720000::Right.
0:10:57.720000 - 0:11:04.320000::I feel like in nice hotels, the rooms, all of their money goes into making the lobby, making
0:11:04.320000 - 0:11:08.480000::the facade look incredible for these hotels.
0:11:08.480000 - 0:11:13.040000::And then you go into the room and you're like, this is just a normal fucking hotel.
0:11:13.040000 - 0:11:16.920000::Like why am I paying like $300 a night for this shit?
0:11:16.920000 - 0:11:21.520000::And they try to fool you and thinking that you're in some high class with the bar, with
0:11:21.520000 - 0:11:25.400000::the fucking, the lobby with the pool, with the amenities.
0:11:25.400000 - 0:11:27.800000::And it's like, dude, give me a nice room.
0:11:27.800000 - 0:11:33.200000::If I'm, if this, if this hotel, and you're getting pissed off, what?
0:11:33.200000 - 0:11:35.880000::You're getting pissed and you're getting angry when you're talking like this.
0:11:35.880000 - 0:11:38.040000::No, I'm just mismaking me think.
0:11:38.040000 - 0:11:42.480000::Well, I've, I'm thinking I've never, I've been staying in my hotels, but I've, it's
0:11:42.480000 - 0:11:47.840000::always been paid for by something evil faith.
0:11:47.840000 - 0:11:52.240000::If I was paying the whole price for a place like this, I would be losing my damn mind.
0:11:52.240000 - 0:11:53.560000::You know what I mean?
0:11:53.560000 - 0:11:55.160000::Because you'd be feeling ripped off.
0:11:55.160000 - 0:11:56.680000::Of course I know what you mean.
0:11:56.680000 - 0:11:57.760000::I'd be feeling ripped off.
0:11:57.760000 - 0:12:03.200000::Oh, this is, this place is better because it has concrete walls and a geometric coffee table
0:12:03.200000 - 0:12:04.440000::that you can't even use.
0:12:04.440000 - 0:12:09.520000::Well, it's good in the time of war that stuff is great, but you're not at war.
0:12:09.520000 - 0:12:10.520000::You're at paradise.
0:12:10.520000 - 0:12:11.520000::Exactly.
0:12:11.520000 - 0:12:13.640000::I think someone just, I think I'll stay busy.
0:12:13.640000 - 0:12:14.920000::You guys are civil war.
0:12:14.920000 - 0:12:16.640000::No, no, which one?
0:12:16.640000 - 0:12:17.640000::I'm boy telling you.
0:12:17.640000 - 0:12:19.840000::A vendor civil war.
0:12:19.840000 - 0:12:21.240000::No, Eric.
0:12:21.240000 - 0:12:22.240000::You know, Eric.
0:12:22.240000 - 0:12:23.760000::You talking about the one who's called?
0:12:23.760000 - 0:12:28.120000::You mean Alex Garland's a 24 civil war, starring Kirsten Denson, all the rest of Jesse
0:12:28.120000 - 0:12:29.120000::Plemons as a psychopath?
0:12:29.120000 - 0:12:30.120000::I just got a text.
0:12:30.120000 - 0:12:31.520000::Eric, I just got a text.
0:12:31.520000 - 0:12:32.520000::From who?
0:12:32.520000 - 0:12:36.480000::It's from Sarah saying tell Eric to open the door.
0:12:36.480000 - 0:12:38.600000::Lemma, oh, it's Sarah.
0:12:38.600000 - 0:12:39.600000::Okay.
0:12:39.600000 - 0:12:43.720000::Okay, this is perfect because I have something I want to call her out about.
0:12:43.720000 - 0:12:47.080000::Okay, so this is what happens on joy tactics.
0:12:47.080000 - 0:12:53.320000::Yeah, we weren't even planning for sluried degest that we've had on two times before and
0:12:53.320000 - 0:12:55.920000::calls into the show sometimes at the very end.
0:12:55.920000 - 0:13:01.120000::Okay, so part of the podcast, you guys at this is actually funny because we're doing
0:13:01.120000 - 0:13:06::the part where we talk about something that is basically something you need to be speaking
0:13:06 - 0:13:07::on, Sarah.
0:13:07 - 0:13:09.560000::Oh, we're talking about women's issues.
0:13:09.560000 - 0:13:10.560000::Exactly.
0:13:10.560000 - 0:13:16.480000::You know, your public says doesn't let you speak on those right now.
0:13:16.480000 - 0:13:20.640000::But what we like to ask, we're talking about hotels and we're talking about how right
0:13:20.640000 - 0:13:27.680000::now you are basically staying in the upper class one and Eric is staying in the mixed
0:13:27.680000 - 0:13:29.200000::income hotel housing.
0:13:29.200000 - 0:13:32.320000::I'm in the house and Eric is in the have not.
0:13:32.320000 - 0:13:33.320000::Right.
0:13:33.320000 - 0:13:39.040000::So what I'd like, so but we're talking about the ethics of these practices and I'd like
0:13:39.040000 - 0:13:44.120000::to bring up a case, I won't say the specifics because this is a project that hasn't released
0:13:44.120000 - 0:13:45.120000::yet.
0:13:45.120000 - 0:13:48.480000::But you were on a little baggy.
0:13:48.480000 - 0:13:51.080000::Carax fans are a little baggy.
0:13:51.080000 - 0:13:54.920000::Well, that's because he's so conscious about what?
0:13:54.920000 - 0:14:01.560000::Maybe your balls aren't big enough.
0:14:01.560000 - 0:14:02.560000::What did he say?
0:14:02.560000 - 0:14:08.160000::He got mustard on his pants last night at Waterburger.
0:14:08.160000 - 0:14:13.200000::Well, that's no, please, please continue, continue.
0:14:13.200000 - 0:14:14.200000::Oh, thanks.
0:14:14.200000 - 0:14:20.120000::What you're saying is you stay, we were working together in a country that I can't mention,
0:14:20.120000 - 0:14:23.080000::but it's just north of America.
0:14:23.080000 - 0:14:24.760000::And it was an incredible project.
0:14:24.760000 - 0:14:29.400000::Everybody will see that I have only mentioned 17 times on this podcast.
0:14:29.400000 - 0:14:37.840000::And you were staying in a hotel, which was probably realistically 700 to $1,700 at night.
0:14:37.840000 - 0:14:44.560000::And I was staying in a scary thing, a tower that looked like a Soviet, whatever.
0:14:44.560000 - 0:14:49.520000::That you that you claimed was admitting an electrical buzzing sound from the walls.
0:14:49.520000 - 0:14:52.720000::I have it on video.
0:14:52.720000 - 0:14:53.720000::And it's not from the walls.
0:14:53.720000 - 0:14:56.040000::It's from outside like the black smoke monster in the walls.
0:14:56.040000 - 0:14:57.040000::It's a clear.
0:14:57.040000 - 0:14:58.040000::Okay.
0:14:58.040000 - 0:14:59.960000::So what I'm saying is board and texting right now.

0:15:00 - 0:15:06::because I'm just I am well he's prepared to let it be.
0:15:06 - 0:15:07.500000::I just wish you guys would talk about something
0:15:07.500000 - 0:15:10.800000::like an interesting or ask me a question or you know.
0:15:10.800000 - 0:15:14::I got a question the breatherite strip is on huh?

0:15:33.200000 - 0:15:39.400000::It's not like I think I'm just like a high velocity like inside sales.
0:15:40.400000 - 0:15:43.400000::You're are you breathe the maxing.
0:15:43.400000 - 0:15:48.400000::Breathe the maxing yeah basically yeah yeah.

0:16:04.400000 - 0:16:09.700000::I really I beg to be on episode I stood outside the hotel room and knocked and
0:16:09.700000 - 0:16:11.400000::waited to be let in.
0:16:11.400000 - 0:16:15.400000::So Sarah yeah tell I was in the 18.
0:16:15.400000 - 0:16:20.400000::You were in the fancy hotel but what's ironic and this is God teaching us once again.
0:16:20.400000 - 0:16:23.400000::What happened with the electricity?
0:16:23.400000 - 0:16:25.400000::What happened with the hot water?
0:16:25.400000 - 0:16:32.400000::Right I was told so I came downstairs into the lobby at this undisclosed location at six in the morning.
0:16:32.400000 - 0:16:34.400000::It's more seasons.
0:16:34.400000 - 0:16:37.400000::What was that?
0:16:37.400000 - 0:16:42.400000::Let's just say it rhymes with poor peasants.
0:16:42.400000 - 0:16:47.400000::Right and a wonderful woman met me in the lobby and she was like Sarah I'm a
0:16:47.400000 - 0:16:52.400000::miss Sherman I'm so sorry to tell you this before you go to work at six in the
0:16:52.400000 - 0:16:57.400000::morning at a workplace that I shall not name but let's just say it rhymes with
0:16:57.400000 - 0:17:02.400000::Melavision Mo and what's that?
0:17:02.400000 - 0:17:05.400000::It rhymes with Melavision Mo.
0:17:05.400000 - 0:17:07.400000::You say what it is.
0:17:07.400000 - 0:17:10.400000::No it even knows what you're referencing.
0:17:10.400000 - 0:17:12.400000::It doesn't it doesn't.
0:17:12.400000 - 0:17:18.400000::She was like I had to say to I hate to inform you at six in the morning but we do
0:17:18.400000 - 0:17:23.400000::have to shut off your hot water and your electricity and I couldn't kind of
0:17:23.400000 - 0:17:28.400000::metabolize that kind of information at six in the morning so I just went whatever I
0:17:28.400000 - 0:17:35.400000::went whatever I come back from a 17 hour work day covered in like 18 pounds of
0:17:35.400000 - 0:17:40.400000::makeup sweat and tears I was crying that day of course and I go to take a hot
0:17:40.400000 - 0:17:46.400000::shower to kind of like wash off the tragedy of the day and which I was looking
0:17:46.400000 - 0:17:48.400000::about on it.
0:17:48.400000 - 0:17:53.400000::She has warned me there is no electricity nor is there hot water.
0:17:53.400000 - 0:17:58.400000::So what is God saying there because he was taking care and protecting of the
0:17:58.400000 - 0:18:04.400000::people who were sitting in the cursed tower of the half-nots and meanwhile in the
0:18:04.400000 - 0:18:08.400000::half God was punishing you and making you sleep in your pile of tears.
0:18:08.400000 - 0:18:14.400000::Well God's hand of justice I think was saying just because someone just
0:18:14.400000 - 0:18:20.400000::because you were having nodding has nothing to do with me having so I actually
0:18:20.400000 - 0:18:24.400000::don't think it had anything to do with me being in the smourst measons.
0:18:24.400000 - 0:18:29.400000::But why was there electricity your electricity from your hotel was floating outside
0:18:29.400000 - 0:18:32.400000::of my hotel.
0:18:32.400000 - 0:18:36.400000::I was giving his stuff as challenges to strongest warrior.
0:18:36.400000 - 0:18:40.400000::Sometimes the toughest challenge you ever have is the easiest thing you'll ever do.
0:18:40.400000 - 0:18:42.400000::Sometimes a let back is a set up for a come up.
0:18:42.400000 - 0:18:44.400000::Sometimes a suck off is a suck up.
0:18:44.400000 - 0:18:52.400000::I think that God was trying to be like because sometimes I'm convinced that money
0:18:52.400000 - 0:18:54.400000::can buy you happiness.
0:18:54.400000 - 0:18:58.400000::You know because I'm like what's not to be happy about I have the shirt I got new
0:18:58.400000 - 0:19:04.400000::shoes I'm so happy but you know as they say more money more problems.
0:19:04.400000 - 0:19:08.400000::Can I say something just to the cool gesture.
0:19:08.400000 - 0:19:15.400000::Sarah I think that fame money and success has worked you in a way that you're
0:19:15.400000 - 0:19:22.400000::unrecognizable from the person that I used to know and I just want that person back
0:19:22.400000 - 0:19:26.400000::and I don't know who I'm speaking with right now I don't know who this version is of you
0:19:26.400000 - 0:19:32.400000::but I think that this has totally destroyed you and wrecked you in a way that is just
0:19:32.400000 - 0:19:36.400000::just it's not good.
0:19:36.400000 - 0:19:42.400000::So you don't think that I'm a queen that deserves to be treated as such?
0:19:42.400000 - 0:19:46.400000::Well if you put it that way yeah not that you're doing it.
0:19:46.400000 - 0:20:00.400000::Don't you think you look like this act like this and rock like this you're

0:20:00 - 0:20:02.960000::He's a little bit to get the red carpet rolled out for you.
0:20:02.960000 - 0:20:06.320000::And then Jack comes to pick you up from this morse measins.
0:20:06.320000 - 0:20:09.240000::When you go outside to get into his car,
0:20:09.240000 - 0:20:12.120000::and he's not four inches away from the door.
0:20:12.120000 - 0:20:14.720000::Wait, did you tell this story, Jack?
0:20:14.720000 - 0:20:16.160000::No.
0:20:16.160000 - 0:20:17.240000::So this is some queen.
0:20:17.240000 - 0:20:19.920000::Do you want to know what it's like to be a queen for a day?
0:20:19.920000 - 0:20:21.920000::More than anything in the world, Ms. German.
0:20:21.920000 - 0:20:22.960000::Jack Ben Singer.
0:20:22.960000 - 0:20:23.560000::He comes to pick me up.
0:20:23.560000 - 0:20:24.400000::Hi, how are you?
0:20:24.400000 - 0:20:25.360000::OK.
0:20:25.360000 - 0:20:26.760000::I step out of the hotel.
0:20:26.760000 - 0:20:29.240000::I crane my neck like this to the right.
0:20:29.240000 - 0:20:30.440000::Like a crane.
0:20:30.440000 - 0:20:33.440000::Just to look for where my friend is in his car.
0:20:33.440000 - 0:20:38.280000::And because I did not see my friend in literally 0.4 seconds,
0:20:38.280000 - 0:20:42.560000::I was ushered back into the lobby by Valet guy going,
0:20:42.560000 - 0:20:44.800000::Ms. Sherman, Ms. Sherman, please, please stay inside.
0:20:44.800000 - 0:20:45.840000::It's so cold.
0:20:45.840000 - 0:20:47.640000::I will go get your friend.
0:20:47.640000 - 0:20:48.640000::And I was really thinking.
0:20:48.640000 - 0:20:49.800000::Probably 60 degrees.
0:20:49.800000 - 0:20:54.200000::I go, I think my friend is like right, you know, a couple feet away.
0:20:54.200000 - 0:20:57.080000::And he ran outside faster than a speeding bullet
0:20:57.080000 - 0:21:02.600000::and made Jack pull all the way around so that he was closer to the door.
0:21:02.600000 - 0:21:02.840000::That's right.
0:21:02.840000 - 0:21:06.800000::So what it was is there's a valet ring or whatever.
0:21:06.800000 - 0:21:08.440000::And I didn't drive into the valet thing.
0:21:08.440000 - 0:21:13.840000::I just pulled up to the front door of the hotel, which is on the sidewalk.
0:21:13.840000 - 0:21:16.080000::Instead of pulling into the property of the hotel,
0:21:16.080000 - 0:21:18.600000::I pulled up to the front door that you could have walked out.
0:21:18.600000 - 0:21:22.240000::So then the guy comes and finds me.
0:21:22.240000 - 0:21:25.680000::He's in a fedora and a vest.
0:21:25.680000 - 0:21:30.880000::And he doesn't just tell me to pull into the thing.
0:21:30.880000 - 0:21:33.800000::He actually like a horse and buggy.
0:21:33.800000 - 0:21:40.720000::He walks in front of my car and is basically vertically Naruto running through the street.
0:21:40.720000 - 0:21:43.440000::So that I know exactly how to take a U-turn.
0:21:43.440000 - 0:21:45.800000::He's like doing my flight path for me.
0:21:45.800000 - 0:21:48.600000::And he's doing like Naruto run your hands go behind you.
0:21:48.600000 - 0:21:52::He was just doing that, but his arm's going straight down.
0:21:52 - 0:21:56.640000::And he's like, hoofing it through the street, takes a left human vehicle style into the
0:21:56.640000 - 0:21:57.640000::valet.
0:21:57.640000 - 0:22:00::Runs around the valet to show me.
0:22:00 - 0:22:01.200000::He doesn't just go to the door.
0:22:01.200000 - 0:22:05.560000::He runs fully around the loop of the valet thing.
0:22:05.560000 - 0:22:07.320000::It was quite strange to see.
0:22:07.320000 - 0:22:08.720000::And it's beautiful to see.
0:22:08.720000 - 0:22:09.720000::I think.
0:22:09.720000 - 0:22:14.280000::And it was because the queen could not be outside in 60 degree weather for more than 45
0:22:14.280000 - 0:22:15.280000::seconds.
0:22:15.280000 - 0:22:16.280000::Right.
0:22:16.280000 - 0:22:19.440000::Because the queen's chariot was more than six inches away from the front door.
0:22:19.440000 - 0:22:20.960000::And now 200 years ago.
0:22:20.960000 - 0:22:23.880000::Do you think I don't deserve that?
0:22:23.880000 - 0:22:27.960000::If it was a thousand years ago, you would just have slaves and we wouldn't even have to
0:22:27.960000 - 0:22:29.960000::have this discussion.
0:22:29.960000 - 0:22:31.400000::Unfortunately, we have to litigate.
0:22:31.400000 - 0:22:32.840000::Oh, would this be sick with this dude?
0:22:32.840000 - 0:22:34.360000::I had this fun experience.
0:22:34.360000 - 0:22:35.680000::Just let Sarah have a fucking slave.
0:22:35.680000 - 0:22:37.760000::You know what I'm saying?
0:22:37.760000 - 0:22:39.080000::That's what she's got in that.
0:22:39.080000 - 0:22:43.720000::But what I need to say is that, sir, you need to be brought back down.
0:22:43.720000 - 0:22:47.200000::You need a reality check and be grounded in some way.
0:22:47.200000 - 0:22:54.800000::Because I feel like you are just in the stratosphere of celebrity and the stratosphere of Hollywood.
0:22:54.800000 - 0:22:55.800000::And I don't know.
0:22:55.800000 - 0:23:00.400000::There needs to be some sort of camp for people like you where you can just get people can
0:23:00.400000 - 0:23:06.200000::like be mean to you and like you live in squalor just to bring you back.
0:23:06.200000 - 0:23:07.480000::Because you need that.
0:23:07.480000 - 0:23:10.640000::You know, you're going to lose your if you keep going this way, you're going to lose
0:23:10.640000 - 0:23:13.200000::your mind to lose touch with reality.
0:23:13.200000 - 0:23:17::Isn't that what you need to be in tune with your audience?
0:23:17 - 0:23:18::You know, you're going to.
0:23:18 - 0:23:25.040000::I know what the deep programming program would be because I just experienced it myself.
0:23:25.040000 - 0:23:30.160000::And if any of your heads get too big, I might prescribe.
0:23:30.160000 - 0:23:38.440000::Dr. Sarah might prescribe to you doing a show at a college in nowhere Massachusetts where
0:23:38.440000 - 0:23:39.440000::I did.
0:23:39.440000 - 0:23:44.160000::Again, I'm a queen on TV celebrity lifestyle Lamborghini's helicopters.
0:23:44.160000 - 0:23:47.120000::Ryan Gosling, you guys know the drill.
0:23:47.120000 - 0:23:55.360000::I showed up to the show in a fully lit, fully empty cafeteria 30 students.
0:23:55.360000 - 0:24:04.880000::The capacity of the room was 1200 and 30 students showed up.
0:24:04.880000 - 0:24:05.880000::And that was a.
0:24:05.880000 - 0:24:08.720000::Wait, wasn't it a community college too?
0:24:08.720000 - 0:24:09.720000::I don't know.
0:24:09.720000 - 0:24:10.720000::You don't know.
0:24:10.720000 - 0:24:11.720000::I verify it.
0:24:11.720000 - 0:24:12.720000::Okay.
0:24:12.720000 - 0:24:15.040000::Because I think Jack told me this story.
0:24:15.040000 - 0:24:19.600000::It was a humbling experience and it kind of brought me down.
0:24:19.600000 - 0:24:20.600000::That's good.
0:24:20.600000 - 0:24:21.600000::That's good.
0:24:21.600000 - 0:24:22.600000::You needed that.
0:24:22.600000 - 0:24:23.600000::You needed that.
0:24:23.600000 - 0:24:26.960000::And then yesterday, all of our friends said that I was annoying.
0:24:26.960000 - 0:24:29.080000::So I kind of well, you are.
0:24:29.080000 - 0:24:30.080000::Okay.
0:24:30.080000 - 0:24:31.320000::So that's just.
0:24:31.320000 - 0:24:32.320000::Yeah.
0:24:32.320000 - 0:24:35.320000::That's just the them just telling you the truth.
0:24:35.320000 - 0:24:38.640000::And I'm kidding.
0:24:38.640000 - 0:24:42.840000::Sarah, you're one of the most affable people on the planet and everyone loves me around
0:24:42.840000 - 0:24:43.840000::you.
0:24:43.840000 - 0:24:44.840000::What's Apple?
0:24:44.840000 - 0:24:45.840000::You know what?
0:24:45.840000 - 0:24:46.840000::You know what?
0:24:46.840000 - 0:24:52.920000::The fools and haters can't handle what a queen has one too many tequila sodas and
0:24:52.920000 - 0:24:53.920000::buy one.
0:24:53.920000 - 0:24:56.160000::Oh, you were drunk off the liquor, weren't you?
0:24:56.160000 - 0:24:58.800000::Well, I want too many.
0:24:58.800000 - 0:25:00::When the queen gets liquor, you know what?

0:25:00 - 0:25:11.040000::one. Yeah, you don't drink ever in like I feel have you been getting faded recently?
0:25:11.040000 - 0:25:15.840000::Yeah, Eric held me down by my throat and forced me. He put a gun on my head and said,
0:25:15.840000 - 0:25:24::we're going out tonight. It's Austin, Texas girl. You can't be around Eric and not get faded.
0:25:24 - 0:25:29.600000::He's too luring. He's luring. By the way, where is Eric? You just you just totally just like hijacked
0:25:29.600000 - 0:25:35.040000::like just came in, grabbed the mic and Eric is just like picking up his clothes right now.
0:25:36.640000 - 0:25:41.520000::He's crouched on a stool. Does he want to come back?
0:25:42.800000 - 0:25:49.280000::Why do you guys want him to come back? Well, we don't. We're honored and we're humbled to have you on
0:25:49.280000 - 0:25:54.240000::and I mean, what do you need to tell me right now to get me back down to earth?
0:25:55.040000 - 0:25:59.120000::To get you back down. Well, this is what I want to say is you could offer me. I want to offer
0:25:59.120000 - 0:26:06.880000::a service for friends of yours, SNL cast members, guests that come on the show that if they really
0:26:06.880000 - 0:26:12.720000::want to be brought down to earth, like they could sign up for my like three-week intensive where I
0:26:12.720000 - 0:26:19.920000::kind of like treat them like shit and they have to work like real like manual labor fast food
0:26:19.920000 - 0:26:24.960000::working jobs and they and I put them in full prosthetics. This would be a great TV show actually
0:26:25.040000 - 0:26:29.360000::where you get to bring, you know, it's like undercover boss but just undercover lower class
0:26:30.240000 - 0:26:35.600000::person and they just get to experience life as a non-salevity and they get to remember, oh,
0:26:36.400000 - 0:26:41.760000::people when people people are being all fake to me 24 or 7, you know, but when I look like when
0:26:41.760000 - 0:26:48.160000::I have the prosthetics on a ball and I have a gray mustache and you're you're just walking
0:26:48.160000 - 0:26:51.920000::amongst the street. People treat you like shit. Nobody wants to talk to you. Nobody wants to be
0:26:51.920000 - 0:26:57.680000::around you. All right, and people hate you in fact. And I think people need to realize that
0:26:58.640000 - 0:27:04.800000::everybody around you is lying to you. Everybody around you is saying is the yes man and happy and
0:27:05.440000 - 0:27:12.320000::and wanting to please the queen or the king. So I think if that if you could just hand out my
0:27:12.320000 - 0:27:17.600000::number to these people and I think I could provide a service for them for a lot of money by the way.
0:27:17.600000 - 0:27:24.640000::Nate, I want to take this a step further. Okay. This isn't undercover boss. This is reverse the
0:27:24.640000 - 0:27:31.040000::swan and I'm saying these people should be getting full reverse plastic surgery permanent.
0:27:33.520000 - 0:27:39.760000::Pervert. So reverse plastic surgery. Now we're having a conversation. Now we're having a
0:27:39.760000 - 0:27:46.640000::conversation. Thank you. So plastic surgery is when you do a surgery which is cosmetic
0:27:46.800000 - 0:27:54.800000::to benefit. So reverse cosmetic surgery is not just the uglification surgically but it's also
0:27:54.800000 - 0:28:01.200000::putting hyperorganic matter into your body. Right. So instead of using silicone or plastics whatever
0:28:01.200000 - 0:28:07.600000::they use microplastics, they would have to use hyperorganic materials such as what what's hyperorganic
0:28:07.680000 - 0:28:16.480000::beans, rice, sausage, shepherd's pie, salt like salt. And they have to just just figure
0:28:16.480000 - 0:28:24.080000::themselves elephant man style by injecting hamburger helper kind of meat into their face into
0:28:24.080000 - 0:28:30.880000::their body into their buttocks and kind of some say that you know, then have to live surgically
0:28:30.960000 - 0:28:40.080000::medically as a. Dude, we're talking about hospitals today. Oh yeah, that's the theme. That's
0:28:40.080000 - 0:28:45.520000::probably a good segue to bring Eric back. I just hear a hospital when I go to Eric Ray. Oh, sorry.
0:28:46.640000 - 0:28:51.680000::But what about your amazing hospital joke? Or did I say hospital? Yeah, you did. But we met,
0:28:51.680000 - 0:28:56.080000::but you we know that you meant to say hotels and hotels. We're talking about hotels. Sorry. I
0:28:56.080000 - 0:29:03.680000::said hospitals because I was probably doing an equation in my head, but I met some hotels and
0:29:03.680000 - 0:29:08.560000::I almost said it again right there. Well, Sarah, do you have anything to discuss about our topic
0:29:08.560000 - 0:29:15.520000::of hospitality in general or hotels or the hotel industry? You travel a lot. You're doing shows
0:29:15.520000 - 0:29:22.080000::on the road. Do you have any opinion about hotels, hotel staff, hospitality in general? I
0:29:22.080000 - 0:29:26.240000::really do. How late you check in and how early you have to check out. Well, Jack's trying to set
0:29:26.240000 - 0:29:32.160000::me up. He's trying to get y'all know my show's $35 for a ticket and he's trying to get a show for
0:29:32.160000 - 0:29:36.720000::free, isn't he? Well, it's called a sneak peak like the morning show. I just have a bit
0:29:36.720000 - 0:29:44.480000::remember where I think it's crazy that how a hotel check in time is late and a check out time is
0:29:44.480000 - 0:29:52::early. So my question is then when am I in the room even? What am I paying for?
0:29:52.800000 - 0:29:54.400000::Right. Did you guys have surgery? Did you guys have surgery?
0:29:54.400000 - 0:29:59.920000::If you hyperboleize, no, I have no, no, this is a new experience for the sleeping part.

0:30:00 - 0:30:06.920000::now. I think the sleeping part is when you pay for it mostly. But then it's so
0:30:06.920000 - 0:30:12.420000::you're paying to be unconscious. I'm paying $400 a night free to not know
0:30:12.420000 - 0:30:19::what's going on. And you want to sleep right now. You want to start talking to
0:30:19 - 0:30:23.160000::about Joe Biden. You're done with us aren't you? No, I've done my little thing. I've
0:30:23.160000 - 0:30:28.020000::been talking now. And I'm done. I'm checked out. All right. Bye. Eric started doing a
0:30:28.020000 - 0:30:35.120000::weird thing. He started showing me a seltzer that has beer in it and going like
0:30:35.120000 - 0:30:43.840000::look you want some. It's hot water. That's beer isn't it? Oh that's the taste like beer.
0:30:43.840000 - 0:30:49.720000::That's right. Toppy. But I think hotels are a scam and we should be pay you
0:30:49.720000 - 0:30:54.440000::should be able to check in at 10 a.m. And you should be able to check out the next day
0:30:54.440000 - 0:31:00.680000::at 4 p.m. Because that my friends is a day in the post. So you want to make a new model.
0:31:00.680000 - 0:31:07::Yes, because what you're you're paying for nights of sleep right. So you're experiencing
0:31:07 - 0:31:12.280000::an unconscious like Nate is saying you're paying to be unconscious somewhere. So that's how
0:31:12.280000 - 0:31:18.760000::they get you in there like actually your vacation has to be two days. And I want to tell
0:31:19.400000 - 0:31:26.360000::right. I want I want hotels because it sounds aggressive. It sounds like we're hating. But
0:31:26.360000 - 0:31:31.880000::understand that this is coming from a place of love. We fucking love the experience that
0:31:31.880000 - 0:31:36.520000::you provide top to bottom. You're fucking doing it so well. We just want more and more.
0:31:38.600000 - 0:31:42.520000::So so don't if you're a hotel and you're listening, don't be disturbed by this. Don't think
0:31:42.520000 - 0:31:49.720000::that we don't respect you and love you. It's just a little off putting that you what it's going
0:31:49.720000 - 0:31:57.240000::on. What are they doing? What could they be doing? So tell me like Airbnb you can miss me with that.

0:32:16.840000 - 0:32:25.640000::So you're against Airbnb's really. I know there's a camera in the toilet. I know that the
0:32:25.640000 - 0:32:31.720000::sheets are covered in someone else's skin cells. I don't I want to be in a hotel. Let me
0:32:31.720000 - 0:32:37.160000::reframe that for you because what if the camera in the toilet is actually a doctor is going to
0:32:37.160000 - 0:32:45.560000::discover a malignant tumor coming out the out the out the booty. And then what if the skin
0:32:45.560000 - 0:32:50.760000::cells on the bed is because Channing Tatum was just there. Some powerful human being. And that's
0:32:50.760000 - 0:32:55.400000::going to rub on your back. Now you got Channing Tatum back. Which is good for you. See what I'm saying?
0:32:55.400000 - 0:33:00.920000::I do need a camera in my butt all asked wondering. Let me tell you this. Eric Rahel again has

0:33:32.440000 - 0:33:39.240000::It was like really. Can't be true. Just say that was shameless.
0:33:39.240000 - 0:33:45.240000::It was not. It was a perfect. Was that a pickup line?
0:33:45.240000 - 0:33:49.640000::Well, I didn't know at the time. No, I don't think so. That's a great.
