0:11:23.240000 - 0:11:26.240000::We're just doing the tourism board route
0:11:26.240000 - 0:11:28.320000::instead of managers and agents and stuff.
0:11:28.320000 - 0:11:29.640000::Yeah.
0:11:29.640000 - 0:11:31.560000::But no, we're just saying, please,
0:11:31.560000 - 0:11:33.920000::because we know that one's going to be extra fun
0:11:33.920000 - 0:11:35.720000::at the cactus club.
0:11:35.720000 - 0:11:38.320000::And we know, like, is like our,
0:11:38.320000 - 0:11:40.680000::one of our favorite hidden gem cities in America.
0:11:40.680000 - 0:11:41.920000::Oh, Milwaukee's the best.
0:11:41.920000 - 0:11:43.920000::That's probably number one city in my opinion,
0:11:43.920000 - 0:11:44.920000::in America.
0:11:44.920000 - 0:11:46.440000::Number the two-par foundation.
0:11:46.440000 - 0:11:47.280000::Yes.
0:11:47.280000 - 0:11:48.280000::Oh, that's just amazing.
0:11:48.280000 - 0:11:50.760000::I love everything about Milwaukee's sick.
0:11:50.760000 - 0:11:53.560000::Milwaukee is one of the most goaded cities.
0:11:53.560000 - 0:11:56.840000::No, everyone in the country is sleeping on Milwaukee.
0:11:56.840000 - 0:11:59.480000::Milwaukee is fucking got it.
0:11:59.480000 - 0:12:00.360000::Got it going on.
0:12:00.360000 - 0:12:01.200000::Were you there?
0:12:01.200000 - 0:12:02.200000::Oh, yeah, you were there, Nate.
0:12:02.200000 - 0:12:03.680000::This is the night that we got to.
0:12:03.680000 - 0:12:06.040000::I've left the park for a long time
0:12:06.040000 - 0:12:07.240000::and we became worried about you.
0:12:07.240000 - 0:12:10.400000::That was cool, man.
0:12:10.400000 - 0:12:11.400000::That was really cool.
0:12:11.400000 - 0:12:14.160000::But that was the way Danie was bringing the rotos
0:12:14.160000 - 0:12:16.440000::around the minty hydrops.
0:12:16.440000 - 0:12:17.240000::Oh, yes.
0:12:17.240000 - 0:12:18.080000::Yeah.
0:12:18.080000 - 0:12:19.760000::Remember, I hit the rotos, put that in.
0:12:19.760000 - 0:12:24.760000::Then I'm sipping on a pain killer at a fucking foundation.
0:12:24.760000 - 0:12:27.600000::And then I knew we were having a party later that night
0:12:27.600000 - 0:12:29.600000::and her friends backyard.
0:12:29.600000 - 0:12:32.240000::I don't ever get to feel that way in New York.
0:12:32.240000 - 0:12:33.080000::You know what I mean?
0:12:33.080000 - 0:12:36.600000::I never have that kind of with all my best friends.
0:12:36.600000 - 0:12:38.040000::Something's missing in my life,
0:12:38.040000 - 0:12:39.600000::thinking about how happy that night is.
0:12:39.600000 - 0:12:41.920000::The house party, the house party, you're not going
0:12:41.920000 - 0:12:42.960000::to any functions.
0:12:42.960000 - 0:12:45.480000::It's hard to have a function in New York, you know?
0:12:45.480000 - 0:12:47.880000::We host one, maybe barbecue in our back,
0:12:48.600000 - 0:12:52.440000::little parking lot here, one about once a year.
0:12:52.440000 - 0:12:53.800000::And that's the best day of my life.
0:12:53.800000 - 0:12:59.920000::I would like to go to one like fucking lit house party

0:13:08.600000 - 0:13:10.560000::And I'm not going to care about the next day
0:13:10.560000 - 0:13:12.400000::or the next couple of days.
0:13:12.400000 - 0:13:16.040000::And I'm just going to just let loose in somebody's house,
0:13:16.040000 - 0:13:18.640000::not mine, somebody else's house.
0:13:18.640000 - 0:13:21.040000::And you're flashing them pink eraser tips
0:13:21.040000 - 0:13:22.880000::to everybody all the after about two shots.
0:13:22.880000 - 0:13:25.880000::It's like crying about how much you love everybody.
0:13:25.880000 - 0:13:28.920000::We did improv together, man, remember?

0:15:40.120000 - 0:15:44.120000::It's about letting loose when the educational system
0:15:44.120000 - 0:15:49.120000::is on your back and they are hounding your brain
0:15:50 - 0:15:53.840000::and your body is crumbling from all the stress
0:15:53.840000 - 0:15:58.520000::of what you, of the expectations that society's putting on you.
0:15:58.560000 - 0:16:01.280000::You just need a week off where you can let loose
0:16:01.280000 - 0:16:04.160000::and get fucking drunk as fuck on the beach
0:16:04.160000 - 0:16:09.160000::and twerk that fucking ass off in front of a sort of wet t-shirt

0:16:24.200000 - 0:16:26.160000::I went on a mission trip with my school.
0:16:28.520000 - 0:16:30.040000::What was the mission call?
0:16:30.040000 - 0:16:31.200000::Mission back.
0:16:31.200000 - 0:16:32.040000::Mission back.

0:16:32.880000 - 0:16:34.200000::No, dude.
0:16:34.200000 - 0:16:35.040000::Not even.
0:16:35.040000 - 0:16:36.760000::Bunghits for Jesus road trip.
0:16:36.760000 - 0:16:38.880000::Yeah, that's 11.
0:16:38.880000 - 0:16:40.520000::That's nothing for you guys.
0:16:40.520000 - 0:16:44.880000::No, it was called La Casa, the house.
0:16:44.880000 - 0:16:46.200000::Okay.
0:16:46.200000 - 0:16:49.760000::And me and my family and a bunch of other families
0:16:49.760000 - 0:16:54.600000::from our evangelical school drove down from Seattle to Tijuana.
0:16:55.600000 - 0:16:59.400000::Do a poor, very poor part of Tijuana and we built a house.
0:16:59.400000 - 0:17:03.200000::We did basically the stream more makeover for one family
0:17:03.200000 - 0:17:06.280000::in the basically, this is so fucked up.
0:17:06.280000 - 0:17:08.640000::These people, a lot of people are living like plastic,
0:17:08.640000 - 0:17:12.400000::like makeshift houses, like cardboard doors.
0:17:13.400000 - 0:17:17.200000::It was like so tough to see that, especially as a kid
0:17:17.200000 - 0:17:20.400000::and be like, we're pulling up an SUVs that we drove
0:17:20.400000 - 0:17:22.600000::with many like players.
0:17:22.600000 - 0:17:24.360000::I saw my first boobs.
0:17:24.360000 - 0:17:27.280000::A, stop my first boobs watching the movie Airplane
0:17:27.280000 - 0:17:29.360000::when that woman goes through the security thing
0:17:29.360000 - 0:17:30.640000::and it's X-ray.
0:17:30.640000 - 0:17:35.400000::B, the real, you saw your first boobs on a TV.
0:17:35.400000 - 0:17:36.720000::On a TV real life.
0:17:36.720000 - 0:17:40.800000::And it was an X-ray tit, does that count?
0:17:40.800000 - 0:17:42.760000::No, it's, you need to watch movie.
0:17:42.760000 - 0:17:43.440000::It's full.
0:17:43.440000 - 0:17:44.280000::It's fun.
0:17:44.280000 - 0:17:46.160000::There's no debating that.
0:17:46.160000 - 0:17:48::I saw the dude.
0:17:48 - 0:17:48.840000::All right.
0:17:48.840000 - 0:17:50.600000::Like for real, I really did.
0:17:50.600000 - 0:17:51.760000::And I'm not really different.
0:17:51.760000 - 0:17:52.760000::I'm gonna check with the movie out.
0:17:52.760000 - 0:17:56.080000::And if you're lying, I'm gonna bring it up.
0:17:57.040000 - 0:17:59.680000::Anyways, it felt bad because we gave one single family
0:17:59.680000 - 0:18:02.840000::like a nice concrete home, you know what I mean?
0:18:02.840000 - 0:18:05.200000::And we like cooked them up with TV.
0:18:05.200000 - 0:18:07.360000::They had like a full-ass house.
0:18:07.360000 - 0:18:10::But then all their, they got picked, I think, at random.
0:18:10 - 0:18:12.720000::And then all their neighbors just still had the same houses
0:18:12.720000 - 0:18:15.480000::and I could see the jealousy.
0:18:15.480000 - 0:18:17.120000::I could see a major jealousy.
0:18:17.120000 - 0:18:17.960000::This seems to happen.
0:18:17.960000 - 0:18:19.640000::So how could you not be?
0:18:19.640000 - 0:18:23.560000::You created a disparity, a housing disparity.
0:18:23.560000 - 0:18:24.680000::Why that family?
0:18:24.680000 - 0:18:27.360000::Was it, was it real, were they like Christian?
0:18:27.360000 - 0:18:28.440000::And that's why you, yeah.
0:18:28.440000 - 0:18:30.360000::I think that picked the Christian ones.
0:18:32.360000 - 0:18:34.040000::And you guys have heard this story before,
0:18:34.040000 - 0:18:38.840000::but this is also the, the, the, the, the, the,
0:18:38.840000 - 0:18:41.480000::the boobs that I saw in real life happened on this mission trip.
0:18:41.480000 - 0:18:42.760000::I'll tell you why, how happened?
0:18:43.720000 - 0:18:47.400000::Basically, you saw boobs on the plane, on airplane, the movie.
0:18:47.400000 - 0:18:49.400000::And then, and then in the same trip,
0:18:49.400000 - 0:18:50.880000::it solved, yeah.
0:18:50.880000 - 0:18:51.640000::Do you know this night?
0:18:51.640000 - 0:18:52.480000::You know the story?
0:18:52.480000 - 0:18:53.640000::Oh, that's awesome.
0:18:53.640000 - 0:18:58.160000::That was cast to be in a, in a Christian panamime.
0:19:00.080000 - 0:19:01.840000::Basically like skit.
0:19:01.840000 - 0:19:04.120000::That was like, we learned it by learning,
0:19:04.120000 - 0:19:06.800000::it was like a videotape from the 80s.
0:19:06.800000 - 0:19:07.640000::They popped it in.
0:19:07.640000 - 0:19:08.920000::It's like 80s music.
0:19:08.920000 - 0:19:10.560000::They're showing you how to do it.
0:19:10.560000 - 0:19:12.720000::It's a Christian organization that sends you the tape.
0:19:12.720000 - 0:19:14.600000::It's an outreach thing, right?
0:19:14.600000 - 0:19:16.200000::So they send you the tape and then they send you
0:19:16.200000 - 0:19:18.680000::all the props, which are all masks, right?
0:19:19.840000 - 0:19:24.240000::And so me and like seven other kids all did this panamime.
0:19:24.240000 - 0:19:27.520000::And the way that this goes is that seven of the kids
0:19:27.520000 - 0:19:29.680000::are wearing all black and they're wearing masks
0:19:29.680000 - 0:19:31.400000::that represent the cardinal sins.
0:19:32.920000 - 0:19:35.520000::So one is like lust, one is like greed.
0:19:35.520000 - 0:19:38::You know, and the greed has like money,
0:19:38 - 0:19:40.560000::dollar signs painted on the cheeks.
0:19:40.560000 - 0:19:42.240000::And they're fucking living their lifestyles.
0:19:42.240000 - 0:19:44.920000::They're having fun for a minute, but then they guess.
0:19:44.920000 - 0:19:46.920000::Fucking devastated by the sin.
0:19:46.920000 - 0:19:47.920000::Okay.
0:19:47.920000 - 0:19:50.040000::The lustful person starts crying in the mirror
0:19:50.040000 - 0:19:53.240000::because she hates herself, somebody like that.
0:19:53.240000 - 0:19:58.240000::Then guess who fucking shows up in all white as Jesus?
0:19:58.240000 - 0:19:59.240000::The devil.
0:19:59.240000 - 0:20:00.080000::And touches and.

0:20:00 - 0:20:01.980000::touches the devil.
0:20:01.980000 - 0:20:04.480000::The devil.
0:20:04.480000 - 0:20:07.480000::No, Jesus shows up in all light and touches their masks
0:20:07.480000 - 0:20:09.400000::and their masks fall from them.
0:20:09.400000 - 0:20:11.120000::They are forgiven for their past
0:20:11.120000 - 0:20:12.680000::and they become Christians on the spot
0:20:12.680000 - 0:20:14.680000::because they accept them into their heart.
0:20:14.680000 - 0:20:16::Guess who that was.
0:20:16 - 0:20:17.680000::That was me, I was Jesus.
0:20:18.600000 - 0:20:20.560000::Okay, I was four foot 10.
0:20:22.560000 - 0:20:23.400000::Tall tea.
0:20:24.720000 - 0:20:26.280000::Tall tea that goes to my knees.
0:20:26.280000 - 0:20:27.600000::White carpentry, I'm guessing.
0:20:28.120000 - 0:20:30.760000::Old Navy pants and white sketches.
0:20:30.760000 - 0:20:31.760000::What do you say?
0:20:32.920000 - 0:20:35.760000::Alan Iverson Jersey Red Pumas.
0:20:35.760000 - 0:20:39.440000::Yeah, fucking G Shock, the fuck the stunters.
0:20:41.120000 - 0:20:43.400000::Anyways, we did it at school.
0:20:43.400000 - 0:20:46.280000::I was so nervous, but I fucking bodied it at school.
0:20:46.280000 - 0:20:48.600000::Then we get to T1 to do it.
0:20:48.600000 - 0:20:50.200000::You know this Jack.
0:20:50.200000 - 0:20:52.080000::And we're standing out in front of a sea of people
0:20:52.080000 - 0:20:54.440000::that live in the area, right?
0:20:54.440000 - 0:20:56.880000::And they're playing the music on a boom box.
0:20:56.920000 - 0:20:59.680000::And I'm coming out and guess what though, dude?
0:20:59.680000 - 0:21:02.760000::There's a woman in the, it's mostly kids,
0:21:02.760000 - 0:21:06.400000::but then there's a woman in the front row
0:21:06.400000 - 0:21:08.680000::breastfeeding with her whole shirt off.
0:21:08.680000 - 0:21:09.680000::So her bag.
0:21:09.680000 - 0:21:10.840000::Oh, okay.
0:21:10.840000 - 0:21:13.200000::So I'm seeing nakedness in that way
0:21:13.200000 - 0:21:14.920000::for the first time in my life.
0:21:14.920000 - 0:21:17.360000::And I'm playing Jesus trying to take off all these masks
0:21:17.360000 - 0:21:18.960000::and I could not stop looking at.
0:21:18.960000 - 0:21:20.520000::Air rock hard.
0:21:20.520000 - 0:21:21.360000::I don't think I could do it.
0:21:21.360000 - 0:21:22.680000::I think I was like eight years old.
0:21:22.680000 - 0:21:23.960000::I didn't, I wasn't an advanced.
0:21:23.960000 - 0:21:25.120000::Oh, you were that young.
0:21:25.120000 - 0:21:26.280000::Eight or nine, yeah.
0:21:26.280000 - 0:21:27.120000::That's funny.
0:21:27.120000 - 0:21:28.600000::Damn.

0:21:30.520000 - 0:21:33.080000::Isn't that what I was used to see that performance?
0:21:33.080000 - 0:21:35.480000::So that was kind of a rocket spring break
0:21:35.480000 - 0:21:37.520000::where I did, you know, wow.
0:21:37.520000 - 0:21:40.040000::And it was spring break.
0:21:40.040000 - 0:21:41.280000::That's right.
0:21:41.280000 - 0:21:44.040000::So a lot of people, I mean, you're, you're,
0:21:45 - 0:21:48.240000::it's just says so much about your character.
0:21:48.240000 - 0:21:49.920000::I had to get that shit off my chest.
0:21:49.920000 - 0:21:53.160000::Or so glad I could tell you guys that long story.
0:21:53.160000 - 0:21:54.520000::You tell us that every day.
0:21:55.520000 - 0:21:56.840000::Well, you know what?
0:21:56.840000 - 0:21:59.560000::Speaking of performance in Christianity,
0:21:59.560000 - 0:22:04.560000::I was, I was a clown and I was in a clown trip.
0:22:05.640000 - 0:22:07.440000::I didn't know what was.

0:22:47.160000 - 0:22:49.920000::It wasn't Bozo, but it was like, and she was like,
0:22:49.920000 - 0:22:51.520000::this is the way they did it, like, you know,
0:22:51.560000 - 0:22:55.200000::back in the fog bill, like days or whatever.
0:22:55.200000 - 0:22:59.400000::And, and yeah, we were clowning for, for Jesus.
0:22:59.400000 - 0:23:01.760000::And then there was also a Mime troop.
0:23:01.760000 - 0:23:03.480000::Was there, people are just filling time
0:23:03.480000 - 0:23:05.200000::in youth groups with just nonsense.
0:23:05.200000 - 0:23:09.200000::Like there, but did you feel like you're doing something good?
0:23:09.200000 - 0:23:10.800000::Were you like, I got to see it?
0:23:10.800000 - 0:23:15.440000::No, it was a complete, like I was like a little like,

0:23:29.680000 - 0:23:32.480000::Like it was, because my dad worked for the church.
0:23:32.480000 - 0:23:34.880000::So I was like, you know, it kind of had like,
0:23:34.880000 - 0:23:38.280000::a little bit of like, yeah, yeah.
0:23:38.280000 - 0:23:39.640000::I couldn't do whatever I want.

0:23:40.480000 - 0:23:41.760000::But actually I didn't feel that way
0:23:41.760000 - 0:23:43.960000::because I would get in trouble and it would feel,
0:23:43.960000 - 0:23:45.720000::and they would tell him if, you know.
0:23:46.720000 - 0:23:49.120000::And you had to be, what was it?
0:23:49.320000 - 0:23:53::Oh, here's one, here's one story where it backfired.
0:23:53 - 0:23:57.320000::We had to draw Adam and Eve and I drew Adam
0:23:57.320000 - 0:23:58.720000::with a fucking dog.
0:24:00.440000 - 0:24:01.600000::He had one.
0:24:01.600000 - 0:24:02.600000::Did he not?
0:24:02.600000 - 0:24:05.320000::He was naked in the, the, what do you expect?
0:24:05.320000 - 0:24:06.640000::What do you expect?
0:24:06.640000 - 0:24:09.800000::You had the bookless scholar to know exactly, exactly.
0:24:09.800000 - 0:24:12.640000::But I drew, but I drew him with a, like a fucking fat
0:24:12.640000 - 0:24:14.160000::down long one.
0:24:14.160000 - 0:24:16::I was like, I'm sized.

0:24:21.320000 - 0:24:22.840000::I look extra forced in.
0:24:22.840000 - 0:24:25.120000::Yeah, people don't draw, people don't draw
0:24:25.120000 - 0:24:27.640000::uncircumcised penises very often, do they?
0:24:27.640000 - 0:24:30.640000::Nah, well, where I come from, yeah.
0:24:30.640000 - 0:24:32.160000::Which is our history class.
0:24:32.160000 - 0:24:33.800000::And then our history community.
0:24:33.800000 - 0:24:36.080000::Yeah, uncircumcised, super bad.
0:24:40.080000 - 0:24:43.680000::But I was drawing, I was drawing, you know, Adam,
0:24:43.680000 - 0:24:48.160000::you know, with a fat dog and Eve, some titties and everything.
0:24:48.160000 - 0:24:49.320000::And I was showing it to everybody.
0:24:49.320000 - 0:24:51.080000::Oh, everyone was laughing.
0:24:51.080000 - 0:24:52.840000::And the youth group leader gets a whole,

0:24:56.240000 - 0:24:59.960000::And my dad sits down with me and he says Nathan.

0:25:00 - 0:25:02::Did you?
0:25:02.120000 - 0:25:05.600000::Because I'm really I was really into drawing the kid like that was my thing
0:25:05.600000 - 0:25:11.440000::And he was like oh right those must have looked pretty good. They were great. It was it was it was impeccable almost
0:25:11.440000 - 0:25:14.440000::Because I was getting these books on an anatomy and stuff like that
0:25:14.440000 - 0:25:19.840000::And I was a whole discussion where my parents was like should he be able to look at naked people?
0:25:19.840000 - 0:25:23.360000::You know and then he can be naked and see himself
0:25:24.320000 - 0:25:27.080000::Right, but that would be what my reading would be with my wife
0:25:27.920000 - 0:25:29.920000::right
0:25:30.640000 - 0:25:36.720000::But he was like did you draw them because you're trying to draw the form of like trying to get it anatomically correct and
0:25:36.960000 - 0:25:42.480000::And I remember that was like the first time in my life. I like both face like lied to

0:26:13.280000 - 0:26:17.200000::About jerking under the eyes of God is that what you're talking about no, but
0:26:17.760000 - 0:26:19.920000::Just talking about that guilt that I felt when I was
0:26:20.640000 - 0:26:24.640000::That age or even older have I told this story before where
0:26:24.880000 - 0:26:29.280000::With Nick Nick the guy that you met in Seattle my childhood friend
0:26:30 - 0:26:30.960000::Yeah
0:26:31.040000 - 0:26:37.840000::One night sleeping over his parents house and his parents had MTV or VH1 whatever and it was about 1 a.m
0:26:38.480000 - 0:26:40.480000::And we turn on the TV and
0:26:41.520000 - 0:26:45.040000::There's a program on it called 100 hottest hotties
0:26:46.240000 - 0:26:49.920000::Okay, you know, we watched every 100 one be announced
0:26:50.720000 - 0:26:54.560000::And this is pathetic because we're about 12. I were too old to be feeling shame for this
0:26:55.520000 - 0:27:01.600000::And basically we watched it like we're like yo, let's watch it like doesn't matter like who like it's like cool that we're doing
0:27:01.760000 - 0:27:05.760000::You know what I mean and then next this is how fucking square I was okay

0:27:08.960000 - 0:27:11.280000::But I was consumed with overwhelming guilt
0:27:11.920000 - 0:27:15.120000::And we had to go to church in the morning after watching 100 hottest hotties
0:27:15.920000 - 0:27:20.800000::And I remember like somehow and it wasn't my church and the church they went to was like
0:27:21.200000 - 0:27:23.680000::Fire and brimstone like old fucking
0:27:24.320000 - 0:27:26.720000::Stanky ass mothball suit wherein

0:27:33.280000 - 0:27:40.400000::And I just was like this is a fucking sign that we messed up badly and Nick I'm looking at Nick and he's feeling the same

0:30:53.280000 - 0:30:55.800000::That would be like, let's get to the doctor, Bob.
0:30:55.800000 - 0:30:58.720000::Because he wasn't acting like this about a year ago.
0:30:58.720000 - 0:31:01.400000::Now let's get him to trivia, trivia night.

0:31:25.400000 - 0:31:29.480000::The way that we're taught to do it, MTV, you know what I'm saying?
0:31:29.480000 - 0:31:34.400000::Well, I missed out a story from college, dude.
0:31:34.400000 - 0:31:37.520000::OK, that was what I was asking when I asked about it.
0:31:37.520000 - 0:31:43.800000::Where I literally took the megabus from Chicago to Milwaukee
0:31:43.800000 - 0:31:47.320000::to Dan Black's house, the same house that we were staying at,
0:31:47.320000 - 0:31:49.400000::when you got too high.
0:31:49.400000 - 0:31:52.840000::And we drank about 40 spotted cows.
0:31:52.840000 - 0:31:57.760000::And I got, and I also got too high and got very scared.
0:31:57.760000 - 0:31:59.680000::What is it about the Milwaukee?
0:31:59.680000 - 0:32:00.720000::Watch out, Milwaukee.
0:32:00.720000 - 0:32:01.720000::It makes you.
0:32:01.720000 - 0:32:03.400000::Dude, you know, it's crazy.
0:32:03.400000 - 0:32:07.160000::I look, there's like the bench drinking
0:32:07.160000 - 0:32:10.560000::charts map or something, which I'm constantly observing,
0:32:10.560000 - 0:32:12.800000::the fucking heat maps of where I've been drinking is happening.
0:32:12.800000 - 0:32:15.080000::Right.
0:32:15.080000 - 0:32:20.200000::Milwaukee is like the number one city of people who drink too much.
0:32:20.200000 - 0:32:21.520000::For real.
0:32:21.520000 - 0:32:22.440000::I could see that.
0:32:22.440000 - 0:32:23.640000::Oh, no, Milwaukee.
0:32:23.640000 - 0:32:27.640000::But we know what we have to do when we're there next week then.
0:32:27.640000 - 0:32:28.600000::Drink.
0:32:28.600000 - 0:32:31.720000::No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, not what?
0:32:31.720000 - 0:32:33.240000::The opposite.
0:32:33.240000 - 0:32:34.240000::Smell it.
0:32:34.240000 - 0:32:36.880000::We got to call everyone together down to no, man.
0:32:36.880000 - 0:32:39.080000::I guess spit would be the opposite of drink.
0:32:39.080000 - 0:32:40.200000::We're going to talk that way.
0:32:40.200000 - 0:32:45.760000::But no, we have to help everybody on their journey of drinking.
0:32:45.760000 - 0:32:47.040000::Yeah, I'll do my best.
0:32:47.040000 - 0:32:49.640000::That's what this whole tour is about.
0:32:49.640000 - 0:32:51.040000::That's a bright, right?
0:32:51.040000 - 0:32:54.360000::But no, you know what now that I think about it,
0:32:54.360000 - 0:32:56.120000::none of us have really had the spring break
0:32:56.120000 - 0:32:58.840000::that we all wanted as children.
0:32:58.840000 - 0:33:01.960000::Why do I feel like a movie plot is basically about two and two?
0:33:01.960000 - 0:33:03.760000::Why?
0:33:03.760000 - 0:33:06.040000::Yeah, it's because wait a minute.
0:33:06.040000 - 0:33:10.280000::Nate, why don't, as we were speaking about before the podcast,
0:33:10.280000 - 0:33:13.760000::why don't Eric and I cancel this leg of the tour?
0:33:13.760000 - 0:33:16.480000::That's actually not.
0:33:16.480000 - 0:33:19.160000::Well, I guess for this episode, well,
0:33:19.160000 - 0:33:23.240000::I can't do the logic on this, but yeah, why don't we go
0:33:23.240000 - 0:33:26.800000::and do it up and just hire a body double
0:33:26.800000 - 0:33:29.600000::to surprise your friends and chill with them.
0:33:29.600000 - 0:33:33.680000::Meanwhile, three of us, we're going down to Guatemala City.

0:34:01.920000 - 0:34:04.400000::crazy far outside of the realm of normal,
0:34:04.400000 - 0:34:05.600000::because what would have been normal?

0:36:54.080000 - 0:36:56.080000::I haven't thought about ostrodomists.
0:36:56.720000 - 0:36:57.120000::In it.
0:36:57.760000 - 0:36:58.560000::No, ostrodomists.
0:36:58.560000 - 0:36:59.360000::Flostrodomists.
0:36:59.360000 - 0:37:00.640000::You know, flostrodomists, right?
0:37:01.520000 - 0:37:02.480000::And what now?
0:37:04.480000 - 0:37:07.120000::I don't know very songs, but I remember that he exists.
0:37:07.120000 - 0:37:08.480000::Who's flostrodomists?
0:37:08.480000 - 0:37:09.360000::It sounds vaguely.
0:37:09.360000 - 0:37:13.680000::It sounds like I might have seen that one time 15 years ago.
0:37:13.680000 - 0:37:15.280000::That's a duo actually, dude.
0:37:15.920000 - 0:37:17.600000::You like EDM right?
0:37:18.800000 - 0:37:19.360000::Yeah.
0:37:19.360000 - 0:37:22.320000::So go listen to them right now, man.
0:37:23.120000 - 0:37:28.080000::No, but yeah, that's not good.
0:37:28.080000 - 0:37:30.800000::I don't know why that set me off in such a bad mood, man.
0:37:31.760000 - 0:37:34.240000::Well, because there's nothing you can do about it.
0:37:34.240000 - 0:37:38.640000::So when it's really weird to be in a position where you see that you're driving into a wall,
0:37:39.280000 - 0:37:41.360000::right, but you can't grab the steering wheel.
0:37:42.080000 - 0:37:43.600000::What do you do in that scenario?
0:37:43.600000 - 0:37:44.320000::What do you do?
0:37:44.320000 - 0:37:46.480000::Grab the fucking gymbie.
0:37:46.480000 - 0:37:47.200000::Grab the driver.
0:37:47.200000 - 0:37:48.400000::Grab the gymbie.
0:37:48.400000 - 0:37:49.520000::Grab a loved one.
0:37:49.520000 - 0:37:53.920000::Grab someone for a night that you're lusting after.
0:37:53.920000 - 0:37:54.560000::Who cares?
0:37:54.560000 - 0:37:55.680000::What does it matter in the end?
0:37:55.680000 - 0:37:56.720000::It's all burning.
0:37:58.160000 - 0:37:59.680000::It all ends right after this.
0:37:59.680000 - 0:38:01.280000::There's nothing next after this.
0:38:01.280000 - 0:38:02.720000::This is all grand experiments.
0:38:02.720000 - 0:38:03.920000::And where the fucking ponds?
0:38:05.200000 - 0:38:06.400000::Is that what you want to put out to?
0:38:06.400000 - 0:38:07.840000::Joy tactics, dude.
0:38:09.520000 - 0:38:10.720000::Joy tactics.
0:38:10.720000 - 0:38:11.520000::Joy.
0:38:11.520000 - 0:38:12.240000::No, you know what?
0:38:12.240000 - 0:38:14.400000::Sometimes there is joy in a oblivion.
0:38:14.400000 - 0:38:15.360000::You know what I mean?
0:38:15.360000 - 0:38:16.160000::There's joy in it.
0:38:16.160000 - 0:38:18.160000::Oh, there's constantly joy in a oblivion.
0:38:18.160000 - 0:38:18.960000::Almost everywhere you go.
0:38:18.960000 - 0:38:19.840000::And it's the only way.
0:38:19.840000 - 0:38:21.120000::That's the whole thing about a oblivion.
0:38:21.120000 - 0:38:23.280000::Is it's just endless boundless fun.
0:38:23.280000 - 0:38:24.320000::A oblivion.
0:38:24.320000 - 0:38:25.360000::Do you know what it was?
0:38:25.360000 - 0:38:26.320000::I don't call it.
0:38:26.320000 - 0:38:28.960000::What was making me laugh was I was kind of...
0:38:28.960000 - 0:38:31.280000::I figured out how I got in this conversation.
0:38:31.280000 - 0:38:32.400000::I was discussing
0:38:33.680000 - 0:38:37.280000::like the joy tactics with my girlfriend.
0:38:37.280000 - 0:38:41.360000::And she was just like roasting the pod,
0:38:41.360000 - 0:38:44.480000::like the ethos of like our whole mission is like, you know,
0:38:44.480000 - 0:38:45.680000::this bread joy.
0:38:45.680000 - 0:38:46.160000::Yeah.
0:38:46.160000 - 0:38:49.040000::And she was like, what have you guys have done
0:38:49.040000 - 0:38:51.200000::literally nothing like for the world?
0:38:51.200000 - 0:38:54::Like, like absolutely nothing.
0:38:54 - 0:38:54.960000::Damn, why was she going in?
0:38:54.960000 - 0:38:55.200000::No.
0:38:55.200000 - 0:38:55.760000::It's like that.
0:38:55.760000 - 0:38:58.080000::That's like, man.
0:38:58.080000 - 0:38:59.840000::I was just talking about like volunteering
0:38:59.840000 - 0:39:01.120000::and like that type of stuff.
0:39:01.120000 - 0:39:04::Oh, well, we don't talk about it.
0:39:04 - 0:39:04.640000::Well, well.
0:39:04.640000 - 0:39:08.480000::So the haters come from within the fucking compound.
0:39:08.480000 - 0:39:09.840000::How curious.
0:39:09.840000 - 0:39:11.920000::Well, bleep.
0:39:11.920000 - 0:39:13.120000::Well, is that your name?
0:39:13.200000 - 0:39:16.080000::But yeah, do you know how much...
0:39:16.080000 - 0:39:20.160000::How many times are videos I've been circulated in group chats for
0:39:20.160000 - 0:39:23.040000::and because someone just died from the group chat
0:39:23.040000 - 0:39:24.160000::and they need to cheer everybody up?
0:39:26.560000 - 0:39:28.560000::Well, yeah, I guess I could be pouring a cup of soup
0:39:28.560000 - 0:39:30.880000::to someone who's just faking being poor.
0:39:30.880000 - 0:39:33.680000::Or could I make a hilarious content?
0:39:34.480000 - 0:39:34.960000::Yeah, I don't know.
0:39:34.960000 - 0:39:37.840000::Are you saying that people at soup kitchens are faking it?
0:39:39.360000 - 0:39:40.400000::That's what I've been reading.
0:39:41.360000 - 0:39:42.880000::Oh, trust you.
0:39:44.400000 - 0:39:45.280000::No, no, no, no.
0:39:45.280000 - 0:39:46.080000::But fair point.
0:39:46.080000 - 0:39:47.120000::Well, joy.
0:39:47.120000 - 0:39:49.600000::Joy, um, listen, no.
0:39:49.600000 - 0:39:52.240000::All of what we're doing is setting up for
0:39:53.440000 - 0:39:56.400000::the, you know, the joys that we're going to give down the line.
0:39:56.400000 - 0:39:58.640000::Like, last, listen, last time we went to Atlantic City.
0:39:59.600000 - 0:39:59.920000::And

0:40:00 - 0:40:05.560000::and we didn't have that much means to help revitalize the city.
0:40:05.560000 - 0:40:09.080000::They just tore down the Trump hotel.
0:40:09.080000 - 0:40:11.680000::The buildings basically looked fake.
0:40:11.680000 - 0:40:13.680000::It looked like haunted houses left and right.
0:40:13.680000 - 0:40:16.240000::The taxi cab was driven by ancient spirit.
0:40:16.240000 - 0:40:17.960000::That was singing, I mean,
0:40:17.960000 - 0:40:20.120000::John, I've never heard of my life.
0:40:20.120000 - 0:40:22.960000::I've fully forgot about that.
0:40:22.960000 - 0:40:26.080000::I think I have that on video.
0:40:27.120000 - 0:40:27.960000::Oh yeah.
0:40:27.960000 - 0:40:29.200000::That would be good to show people.
0:40:29.200000 - 0:40:30.040000::I cannot fucking want it.
0:40:30.040000 - 0:40:33.400000::But next time we need to go back, we have to go back.
0:40:33.400000 - 0:40:34.720000::We're going when you're coming.
0:40:34.720000 - 0:40:35.880000::May.
0:40:35.880000 - 0:40:36.720000::Yeah.

0:41:08.600000 - 0:41:10.120000::I never have.
0:41:10.120000 - 0:41:14.360000::I really want my own space and it's kind of quite healthy.
0:41:14.360000 - 0:41:15.800000::I'm trying to bribe you to come over.
0:41:15.800000 - 0:41:18.200000::24, 7.

0:41:55.760000 - 0:42:00.280000::Or wait, no, it's porosos, I believe.
0:42:00.280000 - 0:42:01.760000::Oh, we already talked about this.
0:42:01.760000 - 0:42:03.760000::It should be dososos.
0:42:03.760000 - 0:42:07.760000::Tom Sikger and Bert, Crisers, Licker, I've stocked up on it.
0:42:07.760000 - 0:42:09.600000::I'm fucking supporting the guy.
0:42:09.600000 - 0:42:11.520000::You're already infusing it with all different types
0:42:11.520000 - 0:42:13.360000::like leechy infusion.
0:42:13.360000 - 0:42:15.360000::Yeah.
0:42:15.360000 - 0:42:18::Ginger, infusion, China, sell them some flavors.

0:42:21.960000 - 0:42:23.480000::So it's like the ultimate.
0:42:23.480000 - 0:42:24.920000::You can't get hung over on it.
0:42:24.920000 - 0:42:27.280000::Oh, no, that's actually dangerous.
0:42:27.280000 - 0:42:29.600000::Why don't people do that?
0:42:29.600000 - 0:42:30.600000::What?
0:42:30.600000 - 0:42:33.320000::Mixing an electrolyte and shaking it up with a bottle of Tito's.
0:42:33.320000 - 0:42:34.240000::That's impossible to get.
0:42:34.240000 - 0:42:36.920000::Wait, do that again.
0:42:36.920000 - 0:42:38.680000::Hey, guys.
0:42:38.680000 - 0:42:41.240000::If you're listening, Paul, if you are listening,
0:42:41.240000 - 0:42:45.760000::maybe it's doing the most hilarious shit with this.

0:42:46.600000 - 0:42:48.400000::Speaking of, did you guys watch?
0:42:48.400000 - 0:42:49.520000::Did you get, did you say that?
0:42:49.520000 - 0:42:52.040000::Because you watched this movie, Ricky Stinicke.
0:42:52.040000 - 0:42:54.440000::No, I haven't turned Ricky Stinicke on yet.
0:42:54.440000 - 0:42:55.800000::I'm waiting for the right.
0:42:55.800000 - 0:42:57.480000::Oh, really?
0:42:57.480000 - 0:42:58.480000::Well, there's a...
0:42:58.480000 - 0:42:59.320000::What's this?
0:42:59.320000 - 0:43:02.360000::There's kind of a similar joke.
0:43:02.360000 - 0:43:05.040000::You don't know about Ricky Stinicke, Jack.
0:43:05.040000 - 0:43:08.120000::I swear to God, I swear to God, I heard about this.
0:43:08.120000 - 0:43:09.120000::I think Ricky Station.
0:43:09.120000 - 0:43:10.600000::I googled Ricky Station before.
0:43:10.600000 - 0:43:11.640000::Why did I googled that?
0:43:11.640000 - 0:43:15.200000::Well, it's a new comedy film made by Amazon.
0:43:15.200000 - 0:43:16.600000::Starring John Cena.
0:43:16.600000 - 0:43:19.560000::Starring Andrew Santino.

0:43:23.800000 - 0:43:24.800000::Efron.
0:43:24.800000 - 0:43:27.400000::Why does it feel like when you say Ricky Stinicke
0:43:27.400000 - 0:43:31.240000::that you're saying something really bad?
0:43:31.240000 - 0:43:32.080000::Do you know what I mean?
0:43:32.080000 - 0:43:32.920000::I don't know.
0:43:32.920000 - 0:43:35.480000::Yeah, it kind of does seem like something like that.
0:43:35.480000 - 0:43:37.600000::Ricky Stinicke.

0:43:46.960000 - 0:43:48.880000::Well, here we'll start with this one.
0:43:48.880000 - 0:43:52.400000::When three childhood best friends pull a prank that goes wrong,
0:43:52.400000 - 0:43:55.560000::they invent the imaginary Ricky Stinicke
0:43:55.560000 - 0:43:58.080000::to get them out of trouble.
0:43:58.080000 - 0:44:04.120000::20 years later, they still use the non-existent Ricky
0:44:04.120000 - 0:44:07.400000::as a handy alibi for their immature behavior.
0:44:07.400000 - 0:44:11.280000::But as it turns out, when three, oh, I almost just started
0:44:11.280000 - 0:44:12.720000::reading it again.
0:44:12.720000 - 0:44:16.400000::LAUGHTER
0:44:16.400000 - 0:44:18.840000::That's how you're going to catch your dementia.
0:44:18.880000 - 0:44:21.480000::Whatever, you know, it's just going to be one moment like that
0:44:21.480000 - 0:44:24.280000::when you realize it's all really, you've lost it.
0:44:24.280000 - 0:44:25.360000::Yeah.
0:44:25.360000 - 0:44:26.520000::That's how sad that is.

0:44:27.520000 - 0:44:28.800000::Not for me.
0:44:28.800000 - 0:44:30.320000::Not happening to me.
0:44:30.320000 - 0:44:34.080000::I'm on too many well-tested medication pills.
0:44:34.080000 - 0:44:36.800000::So what do you think about this plot?
0:44:36.800000 - 0:44:38.320000::I don't really understand from that.
0:44:38.320000 - 0:44:40.160000::I don't really understand what...
0:44:40.160000 - 0:44:42.080000::Here, let me describe it.
0:44:42.080000 - 0:44:45.120000::That doesn't really do justice to what it's about.
0:44:45.120000 - 0:44:47.600000::All right, this is the Ricky Stinicke 10 Minute Block.
0:44:47.600000 - 0:44:49.440000::We'll be discussing this film.

0:44:56.440000 - 0:44:58.280000::But go ahead.
0:44:58.280000 - 0:45:00::So Ricky Stinicke is...

0:45:00 - 0:45:04.720000::these these three guys use this as an excuse. So whenever they this fake
0:45:04.720000 - 0:45:08.880000::person and whenever they need to like get out of hanging out with their wives
0:45:08.880000 - 0:45:12.600000::they're like oh Ricky Stint, we're gonna go hang out with Ricky Stinicky and then
0:45:12.600000 - 0:45:16.240000::they just go on the hospital. He's in the hospital, you know we have to go visit him
0:45:16.240000 - 0:45:21.440000::but they just go out to like Vegas instead. Okay and then they meet this dude who's
0:45:21.440000 - 0:45:27.080000::like a really desperate like actor John Cena and they're like oh could you
0:45:27.080000 - 0:45:31.400000::play like they're like Ricky Stinicky has to be at some event like they we

0:45:37.040000 - 0:45:41.800000::of and you know the hilarity ensues from there. How much did they pay him for
0:45:41.800000 - 0:45:48.560000::that? I think they paid him 200,000 like a I don't know how much they gave him
0:45:48.560000 - 0:45:54.480000::a thousand dollars. Yeah I remember that. Well I'd be curious how John Cena's salary
0:45:54.480000 - 0:46:02.520000::was. Oh no no John Cena doesn't get salaries. He gets exactly he gets
0:46:02.520000 - 0:46:08::we need to be arguing for percentages when it comes to any role we get next
0:46:08 - 0:46:13.800000::close-dare you get Nate next six lines that you get asked for just a percentage

0:52:53.440000 - 0:52:57.920000::That would be and you can't even kill yourself because there's no interest
0:52:57.920000 - 0:53:01.580000::That's how I feel when I'm on the left lane stuck in wall-to-wall 70 mile an hour
0:53:01.580000 - 0:53:04.640000::That he used to get me to and I can't get out used to get my ass to

0:53:26.680000 - 0:53:29.480000::I'm just purely just this is my listening face
0:53:30.880000 - 0:53:32.880000::All right Nate close your eyes
0:53:33.280000 - 0:53:37.600000::Imagine you're in a really bright room the brightest room you've ever been in the new life
0:53:39.200000 - 0:53:41.200000::Oh Nathan
0:53:42.600000 - 0:53:44.600000::Nathan Nathan
0:53:44.600000 - 0:53:46.600000::This is what it's like when you're meditating
0:53:50.800000 - 0:53:56.120000::That's probably one of my favorite things in watching oh, I just got a job meditating in the back
0:53:56.120000 - 0:54:02.160000::Someone just sent me a great. Yeah, Laila just sent me a great picture of us on the beach this summer night

0:54:04.160000 - 0:54:05.720000::But
0:54:05.720000 - 0:54:12.760000::10 feet to the left on top of a bunch of brown seaweed and you're just like fully in the meditation zone
0:54:14.840000 - 0:54:18.760000::It's so sick. It's like truly so admirable
0:54:19.520000 - 0:54:21.520000::But it does make me laugh
0:54:23.640000 - 0:54:28.400000::And what's funny about diving deep within yourself and there's nothing funny
0:54:28.400000 - 0:54:33.040000::Calm your conscious and expanding your consciousness. There's nothing funny about what's happening to your brain
0:54:33.040000 - 0:54:38.920000::But what your body is doing while your brains and another dimension is just objectively
0:54:40.120000 - 0:54:42.120000::Delay different
0:54:42.560000 - 0:54:47::Well, it's funny because you have to laugh at it otherwise. It's just crushingly like
0:54:47.840000 - 0:54:50.680000::Why am I not doing that right? I don't know what you how you
0:54:51.720000 - 0:54:53.720000::Say that but
0:54:53.720000 - 0:54:59.440000::How do I find the calm hate comment because I want to get out dude

0:55:00 - 0:55:03.680000::at this point I don't even know I don't remember what it
0:55:03.680000 - 0:55:08.560000::don't remember. Well can I describe it?
0:55:08.560000 - 0:55:13.400000::I'll bring a spring break memory and bring it back please.

0:55:23.800000 - 0:55:27.840000::out of the country to do it. But your birthday is in October
0:55:27.840000 - 0:55:33.600000::but the United States you have to be 21 but in this little place called

0:55:59.560000 - 0:56:09.800000::first beer was a Stella Ahtwa in a pint glass cheers with my mates were you
0:56:09.800000 - 0:56:17.200000::shaking them is to drink it of course not that was it was pretty typical of me
0:56:17.200000 - 0:56:26.520000::though and then we went out to the strip club after that and the Windsor

1:06:59.220000 - 1:07:04.500000::More than anything. It's a little it's a little thing called ibuprofen
1:07:05.300000 - 1:07:10.580000::What a miracle liquid gel or the red I had devils I
1:07:11.220000 - 1:07:15.580000::The red die first is it the candy coated little tiny
1:07:17.580000 - 1:07:19.580000::I don't I don't
1:07:19.660000 - 1:07:22.820000::What does that mean I don't candy coated is it a little sweet?
1:07:22.820000 - 1:07:24.580000::No, some of them are like
1:07:24.580000 - 1:07:27.220000::And you suck on them a little bit tastes all sweet
1:07:29.300000 - 1:07:36.100000::No, this has zero tastes. It's like the the Walgreens brand. Oh, you're just getting the better Eric ibuprofen
1:07:37.420000 - 1:07:41.420000::Throw them away get some liquid gel and don't get the candy coated trust me
1:07:43.940000 - 1:07:45.940000::That's a good shit
1:07:46.100000 - 1:07:48.580000::Yeah, how many okay?

1:07:56.980000 - 1:08:00.060000::Siby pro Eric Rayhill's fucking
1:08:01.180000 - 1:08:04.380000::Migraine really fucking and these flavor. Oh, but yeah, that shit
1:08:07.420000 - 1:08:14.660000::That squares me away right that I mean some I love when you have like a headache or something and ibuprofen works
1:08:15.220000 - 1:08:17.940000::There's nothing in and it does its job
1:08:18.420000 - 1:08:24.720000::Because sometimes you take ibuprofen you're just like I'm just taking this because I'm like sick and like I'm not really feeling
1:08:24.720000 - 1:08:29.220000::Then you better yeah, but when that shit works. You're like thank God that this thing is this
1:08:29.860000 - 1:08:32.380000::And you know what's funny is food works every time
1:08:32.940000 - 1:08:36.980000::Just to say like if you have a stomach ache not stomach ache, but being hungry
1:08:37.620000 - 1:08:43.100000::You know it's just interesting how food and water also can work just like that
1:08:43.340000 - 1:08:46.580000::Yeah, right. They've got a great batting average really
1:08:48.180000 - 1:08:50.980000::Yeah quick fix trying to get in the baseball
1:08:51.860000 - 1:08:56.860000::But this was my head ache. This is my last resort because I was I looked up
1:08:57.860000 - 1:09:05.140000::Of course Andrew Huberman's protocol on getting rid of headaches because I remember he did an episode on and what is he says like what does he have?
1:09:06.100000 - 1:09:08.100000::and he said
1:09:08.100000 - 1:09:10.100000::creatine works
1:09:10.860000 - 1:09:16.660000::Creatine and like one day this is the final I kind of skip you know, I need it

1:09:40.620000 - 1:09:47.140000::It was I thought he was gonna give me like some sort of like breathing thing or something like that and I was like I already I
1:09:47.860000 - 1:09:56.220000::am sorry shopping list I hate started beans. I fucking did the creatine nothing nothing that didn't do it. Did you take three? I would pro-finter too
1:09:57.220000 - 1:10:00.020000::I took two because I was like maybe I'm an engineer

1:10:00 - 1:10:06.040000::need it later and I don't want to like take three and then need to take two more at night.
