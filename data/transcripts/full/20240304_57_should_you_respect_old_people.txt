0:03:20.840000 - 0:03:24.120000::So what's funny is that they make them like that.
0:03:24.120000 - 0:03:28.360000::But that's speaking of soup and a holy.
0:03:28.360000 - 0:03:32.120000::When you meet somebody who's 99 years old,
0:03:32.120000 - 0:03:35.320000::when you meet somebody who's 110 years old,
0:03:35.320000 - 0:03:39.560000::what's funny is there's a lot of gurus out there these days who are saying like

0:04:01.920000 - 0:04:03.640000::And so what did she order at the diner?
0:04:03.840000 - 0:04:04.760000::Did she get?
0:04:04.760000 - 0:04:06.800000::She ordered the giant does it get me pancake?
0:04:06.920000 - 0:04:10.360000::No, that's not possible because to live so long, don't you need to eat nothing,

0:04:13.240000 - 0:04:16.480000::That's what you would think that's what they're telling us.
0:04:17 - 0:04:19.800000::And she ate a forced bed by the media.
0:04:20.320000 - 0:04:20.960000::A waffle.
0:04:20.960000 - 0:04:21.840000::They're my Nana.

0:04:32.560000 - 0:04:34.880000::Cause what's funny is that's incredible.
0:04:34.880000 - 0:04:36.560000::Did you guys have amazing conversation?
0:04:36.560000 - 0:04:38.240000::Did you ask her questions?
0:04:38.440000 - 0:04:39.920000::Did you get any wisdom?
0:04:39.920000 - 0:04:41.440000::No, we were just talking to each other.
0:04:41.440000 - 0:04:44.200000::We barely yourself like you fucking like you always do.
0:04:44.200000 - 0:04:47.600000::No, we were talking to her about the podcast numbers, retelling her about the
0:04:47.600000 - 0:04:48.960000::the coast of our credits we got.
0:04:48.960000 - 0:04:52.200000::We didn't have too much time to ask her about what's going on, but she really
0:04:52.200000 - 0:04:53.680000::appreciated spending time with us.
0:04:54 - 0:04:57.080000::Well, she pulled up with a full Google doc to show us some pitches that she
0:04:57.080000 - 0:04:58.320000::had for segments for the show.
0:04:59.240000 - 0:05:00::Her really funny.

0:05:00 - 0:05:00.840000::Oh, okay.
0:05:00.840000 - 0:05:02.440000::Yeah, so they worked out.
0:05:02.440000 - 0:05:03.720000::Yeah.
0:05:03.720000 - 0:05:05.080000::We talked about waffles for a while.
0:05:05.080000 - 0:05:05.920000::That was fun.
0:05:08.200000 - 0:05:11.360000::We both like waffles with ice cream on them.
0:05:11.360000 - 0:05:15.320000::But I noticed how quiet you are during this,
0:05:15.320000 - 0:05:18.120000::because you have something against the elderly.
0:05:18.120000 - 0:05:21.320000::You know, I noticed when we go do our elderly volunteering,
0:05:21.320000 - 0:05:23.800000::you usually shy away and go get a plan on your phone
0:05:23.800000 - 0:05:25.960000::and play snake on your phone.
0:05:25.960000 - 0:05:27.560000::And then we get around an old person.
0:05:27.560000 - 0:05:29.560000::And you close your nose.
0:05:29.560000 - 0:05:34.960000::Well, this is this is a tough when you guys brought this to me
0:05:34.960000 - 0:05:37.920000::in in one of our hour long pitch meetings
0:05:37.920000 - 0:05:40.800000::for coming up with topics to talk about.
0:05:40.800000 - 0:05:43.880000::Yeah, I guess that was November 2022, right?
0:05:43.880000 - 0:05:46.880000::When we came up this one on one of our our friends
0:05:46.880000 - 0:05:50.680000::to learn meetings.
0:05:50.680000 - 0:05:53.040000::This one was tough for me because I and I originally,
0:05:53.040000 - 0:05:55.200000::I don't know if you remember this, but I was really resistant
0:05:55.200000 - 0:05:56.480000::to even doing this.
0:05:56.480000 - 0:05:59.200000::And I was like, I don't know if this is something
0:05:59.200000 - 0:06:06.400000::that I can talk about even because I have so much disdain
0:06:06.400000 - 0:06:12.040000::for anyone above the age of honestly, 60 plus,
0:06:12.040000 - 0:06:13.400000::where I kind of draw the line.
0:06:13.400000 - 0:06:15.400000::And I kind of just don't talk to those people at all.
0:06:15.400000 - 0:06:17.920000::Because there's kind of no subhuman to me
0:06:17.920000 - 0:06:20.320000::in a many different ways.
0:06:20.320000 - 0:06:20.920000::Yeah.
0:06:20.920000 - 0:06:23.520000::Well, you grew up in one of them Charlie Charlie
0:06:23.520000 - 0:06:25.640000::and the chocolate factory type of houses
0:06:25.640000 - 0:06:27.360000::with a bunch of old people all in the same bed
0:06:27.360000 - 0:06:29.480000::and they were beating the shit out of you every single day.
0:06:29.480000 - 0:06:31.600000::It's making you put in their toes in your mouth like
0:06:31.600000 - 0:06:36.080000::we've been making them getting candy for them.
0:06:36.080000 - 0:06:38.480000::I can imagine it that you don't like it now.
0:06:38.480000 - 0:06:42.560000::Is it is it also are you like jealous?
0:06:43.560000 - 0:06:47.080000::Like you didn't know which I was that fucking old already?
0:06:47.080000 - 0:06:48.320000::Because they have the them.
0:06:48.320000 - 0:06:50.640000::You don't get that respect different type of bodies.
0:06:50.640000 - 0:06:52.840000::It's built in respect to.
0:06:52.880000 - 0:06:54.040000::Isn't that interesting?
0:06:54.040000 - 0:06:55.680000::You live to a hundred and it's kind of like,
0:06:55.680000 - 0:06:58.800000::all right, built in respect.
0:06:58.800000 - 0:07:01.600000::I mean, are we being taken a fool in that regard?
0:07:01.600000 - 0:07:02.920000::A hundred year old comes up to you
0:07:02.920000 - 0:07:06.680000::and gives you some advice on what to buy or something.
0:07:07.960000 - 0:07:09.400000::Should we really just trust them
0:07:09.400000 - 0:07:10.720000::just because they've been around?
0:07:10.720000 - 0:07:12.920000::What if they were stupid as well?
0:07:14.560000 - 0:07:16.480000::Can I ask you guys a question?
0:07:16.480000 - 0:07:19.640000::Let's go let's look back at the last hundred years.
0:07:19.640000 - 0:07:22::Shall we at this generation that you
0:07:22.360000 - 0:07:25.120000::that you're saying is that we should
0:07:25.120000 - 0:07:27.520000::so we should give respect to.
0:07:27.520000 - 0:07:30.080000::Yeah, let's look back to the last hundred years.
0:07:30.080000 - 0:07:33.360000::What's happened in the last hundred and twenty four?
0:07:33.360000 - 0:07:35::What just happened, Jack?
0:07:37.400000 - 0:07:39.600000::My curtain just fell off the wall.
0:07:39.600000 - 0:07:40.800000::It was hanging.
0:07:40.800000 - 0:07:43.480000::Oh, you know what that that's elderly ghost.
0:07:43.480000 - 0:07:46.800000::It was hanging by a deer head and this deer head.
0:07:47.880000 - 0:07:51.680000::This deer head just fell and it smacked the microphone.
0:07:51.680000 - 0:07:54.360000::That was definitely some type of ghost.
0:07:54.360000 - 0:07:55.720000::I know there are old people living
0:07:55.720000 - 0:07:56.960000::all up in your building.
0:07:58.160000 - 0:08:00.760000::Okay, so but a hundred years ago it's 1924.
0:08:00.760000 - 0:08:03.760000::What's everybody doing reading the great Gatsby?
0:08:03.760000 - 0:08:04.840000::Trying to eat bananas?
0:08:04.840000 - 0:08:07::They're watching every movie.
0:08:07 - 0:08:08.440000::Remember because it was silent
0:08:08.440000 - 0:08:09.800000::and then they couldn't get the volume
0:08:09.800000 - 0:08:11.440000::that loud so it was hell of quiet movies.
0:08:11.440000 - 0:08:14.040000::So you had to really listen close
0:08:14.040000 - 0:08:16.400000::and then they finally got that volume rose in the 30s.
0:08:16.400000 - 0:08:19.880000::A rose tinted glasses on of what the 20s were like.
0:08:20.720000 - 0:08:25.960000::Everybody was just trying desperately to get over
0:08:25.960000 - 0:08:27.560000::the traumas of the first world.
0:08:27.560000 - 0:08:28.680000::No, they didn't give up.
0:08:28.680000 - 0:08:30.600000::You know what they were fucking getting down
0:08:30.600000 - 0:08:31.520000::sucking on each other.
0:08:31.520000 - 0:08:33.960000::You saw the clothes they wore, right?
0:08:33.960000 - 0:08:37.080000::You know what, there's nothing sexier than to me.
0:08:37.080000 - 0:08:39.720000::Flapper, the flapper girls.
0:08:39.720000 - 0:08:40.560000::Oh, yeah.
0:08:40.560000 - 0:08:42.160000::And so when I go to a Halloween party
0:08:42.160000 - 0:08:45.400000::and there's a woman all dressed as a flapper.
0:08:45.400000 - 0:08:48.120000::Yeah, that is exactly what I want to see.
0:08:48.160000 - 0:08:51.040000::And especially if she listens to the shins too
0:08:51.040000 - 0:08:53.240000::and she's dressed as a flapper.
0:08:53.240000 - 0:08:55.200000::That makes sense now because you've been sending me
0:08:55.200000 - 0:08:59::Photoshop images of Sowidi in flapper type clothing.
0:09:01.480000 - 0:09:04.400000::And then I'm just texting you, could you imagine this?
0:09:04.400000 - 0:09:05.760000::Imagine coming home to this.
0:09:08.400000 - 0:09:09.400000::But,
0:09:10.280000 - 0:09:12.320000::the 20s were awesome.
0:09:12.320000 - 0:09:13.320000::They were for dark.
0:09:13.320000 - 0:09:14.160000::They were for dark.
0:09:14.160000 - 0:09:16.080000::What was dark about the 20s?
0:09:16.080000 - 0:09:17.160000::Oh, the great depression.
0:09:17.600000 - 0:09:19.600000::Let's just look farmers.
0:09:19.600000 - 0:09:23.520000::Well, let's just look about 15 to 20 years later.
0:09:23.520000 - 0:09:25.200000::How could that be an amazing time
0:09:25.200000 - 0:09:28.200000::when the world consciousness created
0:09:28.200000 - 0:09:31.160000::such a terrible circumstances to enact
0:09:31.160000 - 0:09:33.840000::the world, the second world war?
0:09:33.840000 - 0:09:36.760000::Can we stop calling it the world war, man?
0:09:36.760000 - 0:09:38.080000::Chilli wasn't in it.
0:09:38.080000 - 0:09:39.840000::Uruguay wasn't in it.
0:09:39.840000 - 0:09:41.840000::Taiwan wasn't in it.
0:09:41.840000 - 0:09:43.840000::Bangladesh wasn't in it.
0:09:43.840000 - 0:09:45.680000::Burkina Faso wasn't in it.
0:09:45.680000 - 0:09:49.320000::I don't know who was in it to be Frank, but what I'm saying
0:09:49.320000 - 0:09:53.760000::and don't make me say that 191 more times, okay?
0:09:55.200000 - 0:09:56.440000::Why do they got a call for the world war?
0:09:56.440000 - 0:09:57.640000::When you realize Jack is those countries
0:09:57.640000 - 0:09:59.680000::were affected by block cades.

0:10:00 - 0:10:02.240000::many of those countries sent battalions.
0:10:03.240000 - 0:10:04.560000::Okay, dude, cool, man.
0:10:04.760000 - 0:10:10.040000::But like, okay, so if there's like a pile up, you know what I'm saying?
0:10:10.080000 - 0:10:14.920000::On the BQE and a bunch of people all get fucking 300 people die on the highway
0:10:14.920000 - 0:10:18.280000::from the biggest explosion of all time because they crashed into a fucking awesome,
0:10:18.320000 - 0:10:20.760000::crazy truck, poison in it.
0:10:21.800000 - 0:10:27.280000::And then it makes me late for the gym or something for a personal training session
0:10:27.280000 - 0:10:28.440000::that I wear on my personal trainer.
0:10:29.080000 - 0:10:33.720000::Does that mean that I'm now getting to say that this was the great thing for me,
0:10:34 - 0:10:34.880000::tragedy for me.
0:10:35.320000 - 0:10:36.640000::You see my metaphor.
0:10:36.800000 - 0:10:38.440000::You see how I just laid that out.
0:10:38.760000 - 0:10:40.280000::Now you have to be good.
0:10:40.280000 - 0:10:41.520000::Jack, you're stable.
0:10:42.360000 - 0:10:44.520000::Following so close as you're building that up.
0:10:44.840000 - 0:10:48.560000::Yeah, well, that's the way I speak is with perfect story narrative and art.
0:10:50.480000 - 0:10:51.800000::Jack's metaphor school.
0:10:52.560000 - 0:10:53.400000::Jack school.
0:10:53.400000 - 0:10:54.480000::Oh, my hiccups went away.
0:10:54.480000 - 0:10:57.680000::If you're, if anybody listened to the Patreon, yeah, that shit went away.
0:10:58.440000 - 0:11:01.280000::Because of my mental fortitude, I finally fucking squash them.
0:11:03.280000 - 0:11:09.120000::A lot of you would have driven most people mad to go through what I went through that day
0:11:09.120000 - 0:11:09.960000::of full of hiccups.
0:11:11.280000 - 0:11:13.240000::No, man, that's a good children's.
0:11:13.240000 - 0:11:16.200000::I wasn't looking up leukemia hiccup connection.
0:11:18.520000 - 0:11:18.800000::Right.
0:11:18.800000 - 0:11:20.320000::That leukemia hiccup connection.
0:11:23.760000 - 0:11:24.760000::What is that going to say?
0:11:24.760000 - 0:11:27.760000::Oh, that makes a, you made a good point with the,
0:11:30.480000 - 0:11:32.440000::the Uruguay battalion.
0:11:32.440000 - 0:11:38.680000::Do you think there was any like country that was forced to send like just kind of like
0:11:38.960000 - 0:11:44.480000::40 dudes to World War II and they kind of just like, they just like hung back.
0:11:44.480000 - 0:11:45.680000::Like they didn't even fight the war.
0:11:45.680000 - 0:11:48.280000::They were just kind of like chilling in like Europe.
0:11:48.280000 - 0:11:52.960000::Like, yeah, no one's like kind of, there wasn't like the UN wasn't around.
0:11:53.200000 - 0:11:54.560000::Like nobody was there to like,
0:11:54.560000 - 0:11:58.760000::Hey, Uruguay, we didn't see you guys on the battlefield like yesterday.
0:11:58.760000 - 0:11:59.840000::No, we were there.
0:11:59.840000 - 0:12:03.760000::We were just fucking, we were like, we fight from the trees.
0:12:03.760000 - 0:12:07.040000::So y'all didn't even see us, but we were fucking getting them, getting them really good.
0:12:07.040000 - 0:12:10.960000::I feel like a couple of countries like just like just had a kind of a,
0:12:11.440000 - 0:12:15.360000::we're in the past years just seeing the country side.
0:12:15.360000 - 0:12:17.360000::You know, on the cruise ships, how they have the,
0:12:18.720000 - 0:12:23.440000::the like party team member, the people who are in charge of like throwing the parties.
0:12:23.840000 - 0:12:25.480000::Yeah, the party's cruise leaders.
0:12:25.480000 - 0:12:26.440000::The party committee.
0:12:26.440000 - 0:12:27.040000::Yeah.
0:12:27.040000 - 0:12:28.840000::That's a real job on the cruise ship.
0:12:29.120000 - 0:12:32.080000::I think that if we were in the in war,
0:12:32.440000 - 0:12:36.200000::we would be in charge of like throwing the fucking DJ parties right after the battles.
0:12:36.200000 - 0:12:39::Make sure our soldiers if I can get taken care of, you know what I'm saying?
0:12:39.320000 - 0:12:40.680000::All types of ways.
0:12:40.680000 - 0:12:42.360000::All types of B box, B box trumpet.
0:12:43.680000 - 0:12:44.440000::Basically doing it.
0:12:44.440000 - 0:12:47.800000::I'm not the more so awesome dance music.
0:12:48.560000 - 0:12:50.040000::Get Miley Cyrus out there.
0:12:50.040000 - 0:12:53.200000::Fucking letting out all the rounds that we didn't use yet.
0:12:53.200000 - 0:12:54.560000::Oh, we still got a hundred thousand bullets.
0:12:55.560000 - 0:12:56.040000::Let that show you.
0:12:56.040000 - 0:12:57.600000::Yo, what else we got left over?
0:12:57.600000 - 0:13:02.280000::Use the mesley tank to use a gun as a beat or the gun drum, the drum gun.
0:13:03.920000 - 0:13:04.400000::Wow.
0:13:05.080000 - 0:13:07.560000::Okay, but let's get back to what we call the elderly.
0:13:08.680000 - 0:13:09.200000::Please.
0:13:09.680000 - 0:13:12.560000::Okay, because I need to tell you guys something.
0:13:12.640000 - 0:13:17.440000::I think I've set it on a previous episode, but we are headed for a crisis right now.
0:13:17.760000 - 0:13:18.280000::Okay.
0:13:19.040000 - 0:13:22.240000::There's an entire generation of what they call the baby boomers,
0:13:22.400000 - 0:13:26.200000::which I've done many studies on who are becoming older and older.
0:13:26.600000 - 0:13:28.440000::And guess the hell what?
0:13:28.600000 - 0:13:30.240000::I'm not going to try to swear as much on this.
0:13:30.720000 - 0:13:32.160000::Guess what, bitch?
0:13:33.040000 - 0:13:33.560000::What?
0:13:33.760000 - 0:13:40.920000::Hey, there is not enough infrastructure to take care of these old people as they begin to decline.
0:13:41.240000 - 0:13:41.760000::Okay.
0:13:42.200000 - 0:13:45.640000::There is the nursing home, retirement care,
0:13:45.840000 - 0:13:48.520000::infrastructure in this country right now is garbage.
0:13:48.720000 - 0:13:49.760000::And if we're smart,
0:13:50.760000 - 0:13:58.960000::we will open up some joy tactics style, retirement homes will make sure the overhead is low as possible,
0:13:58.960000 - 0:14:00.400000::but they're still having a good time.
0:14:00.400000 - 0:14:02.600000::I'm going to try to figure out how to make that happen.
0:14:03 - 0:14:07.560000::Because you can strip away some of these activities as long as we give them exactly how to what how
0:14:07.560000 - 0:14:10.680000::met the quest pros the VR.
0:14:10.800000 - 0:14:11.400000::Exactly.
0:14:11.400000 - 0:14:15.280000::You give them, we put them in the tiniest little like closet pods.
0:14:15.320000 - 0:14:15.840000::Okay.
0:14:16.240000 - 0:14:17.960000::Pods and they get massage too.
0:14:18.960000 - 0:14:19.640000::Yeah.
0:14:19.640000 - 0:14:20.360000::Oh, yeah.
0:14:20.360000 - 0:14:21.360000::Oh, yeah.
0:14:21.360000 - 0:14:22.640000::Oh, for me.
0:14:22.640000 - 0:14:23.160000::Yeah.
0:14:25.160000 - 0:14:26.240000::All day massage.
0:14:26.240000 - 0:14:27.560000::Really oily one too.
0:14:27.880000 - 0:14:28.880000::Too oily.
0:14:29.560000 - 0:14:30.560000::Too oily.
0:14:31.560000 - 0:14:33.120000::But still we're going to put them in.
0:14:33.120000 - 0:14:34.920000::You seen those, you know,
0:14:34.920000 - 0:14:35.960000::portopates, right?
0:14:35.960000 - 0:14:37.720000::It's going to be basically the size of that.
0:14:37.720000 - 0:14:38.240000::All right.
0:14:38.240000 - 0:14:38.480000::Yeah.
0:14:38.480000 - 0:14:39.320000::This is where they sleep.
0:14:39.320000 - 0:14:40.120000::This is where they eat.
0:14:40.120000 - 0:14:40.720000::But it smells.
0:14:40.720000 - 0:14:41.400000::I look good.
0:14:41.400000 - 0:14:44.600000::It's more like in some amazing sometimes.
0:14:45.480000 - 0:14:46.600000::But overpowering.
0:14:47.600000 - 0:14:50.600000::But we're going to, we're going to fucking put them in there.
0:14:51.440000 - 0:14:52.440000::Sorry for cursing.
0:14:53.600000 - 0:14:55.720000::And we're going to put the class on there.
0:14:55.720000 - 0:14:58.840000::And it's just going to make their room look a little bit bigger.
0:14:58.840000 - 0:14:59.080000::Yeah.
0:14:59.080000 - 0:14:59.960000::It's just going to, they

0:15:00 - 0:15:06.440000::That's it. It's not going to do like, they're not going to bet some fantasy land. It's just going to make them seem like they're in like a
0:15:07.080000 - 0:15:09.680000::maybe less than normal size room
0:15:10.240000 - 0:15:13.520000::Isn't their actual room that they're used to and it's just slightly bigger
0:15:14.840000 - 0:15:20.280000::Like a like a VR recreation of their room, but they have like a little more square footage
0:15:21.040000 - 0:15:23.540000::Or is it a different kind of this kind of discussion?
0:15:23.540000 - 0:15:27.840000::But you don't want to put any type of fantasy in there. You don't want to make like okay
0:15:27.840000 - 0:15:32.960000::It's the real room, but then Mickey Rooney's coming in to service you you know what I'm saying
0:15:33.600000 - 0:15:38.440000::Yeah, that's a good one or Carol Burnett's over in the corner doing all different type of break dancing
0:15:39.240000 - 0:15:41.240000::Imagine that
0:15:43 - 0:15:45.720000::I'm saying we could give them an amazing reality
0:15:45.720000 - 0:15:47.720000::I do you know mate right I'm saying
0:15:48.600000 - 0:15:54.760000::But what are we gonna do about this guys because the elderly are about to be thrown to because you know in this in our society
0:15:57.840000 - 0:16:00.360000::We throw the elders to the elders to the curb
0:16:01.200000 - 0:16:07.440000::Look out they treat my lord the fucking chief of state president Joe Biden. I don't even want to get to this
0:16:07.440000 - 0:16:12.720000::He's old because we're abusing him as a country. We have to get into it because just because he's old
0:16:13.160000 - 0:16:19.160000::That people are disrespecting him what you don't realize is if you put somebody who is the opposite age
0:16:19.720000 - 0:16:21.720000::Let's say eight
0:16:21.720000 - 0:16:25.760000::Up in the positions that Joe Biden was in right think they would be behaving
0:16:26.480000 - 0:16:28.480000::Horrably by the way
0:16:28.880000 - 0:16:30.880000::Joe Biden has
0:16:31.120000 - 0:16:33.120000::The age has got nothing to do with it
0:16:33.560000 - 0:16:35.240000::right
0:16:35.240000 - 0:16:37.240000::He's strong

0:22:17.200000 - 0:22:20.600000::His brain was too powerful for the 1800s.
0:22:20.600000 - 0:22:21.640000::Why was he?
0:22:21.640000 - 0:22:23.680000::Why did he figure out so much shit?
0:22:23.680000 - 0:22:24.880000::What was he?
0:22:24.880000 - 0:22:25.960000::What was he sipping on?
0:22:25.960000 - 0:22:27.440000::What was he sipping on?
0:22:27.440000 - 0:22:29.800000::He was Canadian, right?
0:22:29.800000 - 0:22:30.560000::Was he?
0:22:30.560000 - 0:22:31.840000::Was he really?
0:22:31.840000 - 0:22:33.280000::I don't know.
0:22:33.280000 - 0:22:34.560000::No, I don't think he was.
0:22:34.560000 - 0:22:37.320000::He had some crazy accent in the movie, which is why I get
0:22:37.320000 - 0:22:38.160000::most of my phone.
0:22:38.160000 - 0:22:41.400000::Have you heard of this conspiracy theory of the book
0:22:41.400000 - 0:22:46.600000::that in the 1800s that was like predicts Trump?
0:22:46.600000 - 0:22:47.440000::You guys had it for it.
0:22:47.440000 - 0:22:52.520000::That is such a lame ass prediction in 2020, 2016.
0:22:52.520000 - 0:22:55.240000::That evil, orange-haired villain will become.
0:22:55.240000 - 0:22:56::You know what I'm saying?
0:22:56 - 0:22:57.520000::Do you predict it, Trump?
0:22:57.520000 - 0:22:58.360000::Boring.
0:22:58.360000 - 0:23:00.400000::But this was the whole conspiracy
0:23:00.400000 - 0:23:01.520000::if you're not aware of it.
0:23:01.520000 - 0:23:04.960000::There's a book that was published in the 1800s.
0:23:04.960000 - 0:23:07.960000::And it was like, and it specifically names Trump.
0:23:07.960000 - 0:23:09.480000::It was like a golden haired.
0:23:09.480000 - 0:23:15.400000::It pretty much kind of like describes Trump as an orange-handed.
0:23:15.400000 - 0:23:16.600000::Yeah, something like that.
0:23:16.600000 - 0:23:18.960000::And then, but it says like, baron.
0:23:18.960000 - 0:23:20.280000::He has a son named Baron.
0:23:20.280000 - 0:23:23.520000::And then there's a guy named Pence in it.
0:23:23.520000 - 0:23:27.320000::Oh, I'm always sorry about this crazy book.
0:23:27.320000 - 0:23:32.600000::This is the theory that Nikola Tesla, his patents,
0:23:32.600000 - 0:23:38.080000::were given to Trump's uncle or something like that.
0:23:38.080000 - 0:23:41.360000::Our great uncle who worked at MIT.
0:23:41.360000 - 0:23:43.960000::And he had, like, you know, the government
0:23:43.960000 - 0:23:45.960000::like took away all his patents.
0:23:45.960000 - 0:23:49.320000::So he took his, so Trump's great uncle
0:23:49.320000 - 0:23:51.880000::took all the patents for time travel.
0:23:51.880000 - 0:23:54.880000::And then he went back and forward in time or something
0:23:54.880000 - 0:23:57.240000::like that and got this information.
0:23:57.240000 - 0:23:58.240000::He went forward in time.
0:23:58.240000 - 0:23:59.480000::Some crazy fiction novel.
0:23:59.480000 - 0:24:00.560000::Yeah.
0:24:00.560000 - 0:24:02.240000::To the future.
0:24:02.240000 - 0:24:03.640000::So how could you not believe that?
0:24:03.640000 - 0:24:06.600000::And you deny all of these conspiracy theories.
0:24:06.600000 - 0:24:09.440000::Who you're saying that makes perfect sense?
0:24:09.440000 - 0:24:12.560000::Because how else could Hillary Clinton ever lose an election?
0:24:12.560000 - 0:24:15.520000::Only with international interference is through this.
0:24:15.520000 - 0:24:17.280000::Something very mysterious.
0:24:17.280000 - 0:24:19.680000::In the moment, Sheila asked, I was like, this is not right.
0:24:19.680000 - 0:24:21.120000::This is not as it should be.
0:24:21.120000 - 0:24:21.800000::This is fucking.
0:24:21.800000 - 0:24:22.720000::Yeah.
0:24:22.720000 - 0:24:24.520000::This is wrong.
0:24:24.520000 - 0:24:26.880000::These bloodlines need to be stopped.
0:24:26.880000 - 0:24:30.880000::Because what I'm noticing is it's bloodlines.
0:24:30.880000 - 0:24:31.520000::Now we're talking.
0:24:31.520000 - 0:24:33.320000::And we think we live in a democracy,
0:24:33.320000 - 0:24:35.920000::but actually we live in the most fucking nepotistic.
0:24:35.920000 - 0:24:37.640000::The cool.
0:24:37.640000 - 0:24:39.240000::You saw me woke up awake.
0:24:39.240000 - 0:24:40.120000::Yeah, I did see your story.
0:24:40.120000 - 0:24:41.840000::Well, here's what we need to do.
0:24:41.840000 - 0:24:42.880000::Do yourself a favor.
0:24:42.880000 - 0:24:44.480000::Let's all do this.
0:24:44.480000 - 0:24:50.800000::Let's get a syringe full of what's it called when you make
0:24:50.800000 - 0:24:54.480000::somebody not able to have kids in fertilization powder.
0:24:54.480000 - 0:24:58.560000::Get that syringe full of that in your hand.
0:24:58.560000 - 0:25:01.360000::And go and sign up for a minute.

0:25:00 - 0:25:02::meet and greet with Baron Trump.
0:25:02 - 0:25:09::Then shake his hand as hard as you can for eight to 12 seconds until you know that the injection has entered his palm.
0:25:09 - 0:25:17::And that's all we have is kind of like celebrity injection idea last time, but now you're using it to hand him and the bloodline.
0:25:17 - 0:25:19::No, that's the first time I've ever said that.
0:25:19 - 0:25:21::Exact idea.
0:25:21 - 0:25:22::I'm pretty sure.
0:25:22 - 0:25:25::Did you guys know that Nikola, I Tesla,
0:25:25 - 0:25:31::Nicholas invented wireless power in the 1800s.
0:25:31 - 0:25:36::He did what's all this shit and I'm still fucking tangled up in 17 fucking wires.
0:25:36 - 0:25:45::Yeah, conspiracy going around people who ever's making the cords, I think has a very vested interest in not making sure wireless power never comes to be.
0:25:45 - 0:25:50::So I would say look toward the cord makers, look toward the wire makers.
0:25:51 - 0:25:53::Well, do you think that who's at the top of there?
0:25:53 - 0:25:56::Because they're preventing us from having a wireless society.
0:25:56 - 0:25:58::But why?
0:25:58 - 0:26:01::But then take another deeper question and say why?
0:26:01 - 0:26:03::Is it because of the radio waves?
0:26:03 - 0:26:05::I'm tired of having to go this deep.
0:26:05 - 0:26:07::Well, then you don't just sit back.
0:26:07 - 0:26:08::It'll make you less tired.
0:26:08 - 0:26:12::That's what's funny is you will stop being so tired when you just accept the truth.
0:26:12 - 0:26:16::Because you're working so hard to fabricate fabricate fabricate and deal and deal and deal.
0:26:17 - 0:26:18::But maybe they're protecting you.
0:26:18 - 0:26:31::Maybe the wireless world is a world where all of a sudden the radio waves that would be going around your whole head right now would make your head pop out.
0:26:31 - 0:26:32::Oh, instant.
0:26:32 - 0:26:42::If every single microwave was wireless, if every single phone charger was just, oh, I'm just going to wave it really fast through the air because all the phone charging particles are in the air.
0:26:42 - 0:26:46::Your head would turn into a roasted marshmallow within five seconds.
0:26:46 - 0:26:49::And I'd be there to eat it because all my shit would still be wired.
0:26:49 - 0:26:50::Okay.
0:26:50 - 0:26:53::Well, you guys must not have seen this film.
0:26:53 - 0:26:55::I think it was called like once upon a time.
0:26:55 - 0:26:57::I totally would remember it was.
0:26:57 - 0:26:59::I've seen every single TV movie.
0:27:03 - 0:27:06::No, it was by the dude who made Mad Max.
0:27:06 - 0:27:07::Okay.
0:27:07 - 0:27:10::And this was a big flop on the box office came out like two years ago.
0:27:10 - 0:27:13::Maybe starring Idris Elba.
0:27:13 - 0:27:14::Okay.
0:27:14 - 0:27:15::Good.
0:27:15 - 0:27:16::And he played a...
0:27:16 - 0:27:17::Stranger-Broll.
0:27:17 - 0:27:20::A... a... a genie.
0:27:20 - 0:27:21::Okay.
0:27:21 - 0:27:24::And at the very end of the film, he's in our world.
0:27:24 - 0:27:25::Okay.
0:27:25 - 0:27:27::He's not in the...
0:27:27 - 0:27:28::the ancient world or anything.
0:27:28 - 0:27:30::He's in the modern day world.
0:27:30 - 0:27:31::A genie.
0:27:31 - 0:27:34::And he...
0:27:34 - 0:27:36::Has to... anyways, this really stuck with me.
0:27:37 - 0:27:41::But he... in his head, you kind of go into his point of view.
0:27:41 - 0:27:44::And because of all the Wi-Fi, the Bluetooth,
0:27:44 - 0:27:47::whatever, all the wavelengths, microwave's going on,
0:27:47 - 0:27:49::all day long, he hears...
0:27:49 - 0:27:52::And it kind of drives him fucking crazy.
0:27:52 - 0:27:54::But he has to be in this world.
0:27:54 - 0:27:59::And I think how many goddamn coyotes are feeling this way that we have...
0:27:59 - 0:28:02::Because, you know, animals don't choke things like we do.
0:28:02 - 0:28:03::Right.
0:28:03 - 0:28:04::You can't...
0:28:04 - 0:28:05::You can't quite know.
0:28:05 - 0:28:06::You can't quite know.
0:28:06 - 0:28:11::Well, you know the whales are fighting back, right?
0:28:11 - 0:28:12::Yeah, we saw that.
0:28:12 - 0:28:13::Say what?
0:28:13 - 0:28:14::So that last summer, they tried fighting back.
0:28:14 - 0:28:15::The whales are fighting back.
0:28:15 - 0:28:16::The whales are fighting back.
0:28:16 - 0:28:17::Long move.
0:28:17 - 0:28:20::Because we've filled their ocean with microplastics,
0:28:20 - 0:28:22::which is what we're also filling our hearts
0:28:22 - 0:28:24::and our own blood streams.
0:28:24 - 0:28:26::But we're filling the oceans with trash,
0:28:26 - 0:28:28::as I've shown you guys, multiple times
0:28:28 - 0:28:30::with those, my favorite documentaries.
0:28:30 - 0:28:31::But what we're also doing is...
0:28:31 - 0:28:32::That's showing us.
0:28:33 - 0:28:34::Like, all right.
0:28:34 - 0:28:35::Come on, guys.
0:28:35 - 0:28:37::Please, no snacks, no fucking nothing to drink.
0:28:37 - 0:28:38::It can't even give you water.
0:28:38 - 0:28:42::But you have to watch this documentary.
0:28:42 - 0:28:45::But we're drilling into the fucking earth to get oil
0:28:45 - 0:28:47::to power our fucking SUVs.
0:28:47 - 0:28:49::You know how loud that shit is underwater?
0:28:49 - 0:28:53::We got the cruise ships carrying our overweight adults.
0:28:53 - 0:28:56::Not that that's a problem, but carrying...
0:28:56 - 0:28:57::I'm overweight.
0:28:57 - 0:29:00::It's carrying us across the oceans for entertainment
0:29:00 - 0:29:04::as we drink ourselves to death and ignore the global climate crisis.
0:29:04 - 0:29:07::And you know how those fucking propellers sound underwater?
0:29:07 - 0:29:12::We are driving the fish in the whale's mad.
0:29:12 - 0:29:16::We don't even understand how intelligent they are.
0:29:16 - 0:29:19::We're torturing these beasts.
0:29:19 - 0:29:22::And they're going to come and get our ass.
0:29:22 - 0:29:23::I just know this.
0:29:23 - 0:29:25::And the aliens are down there, correct?
0:29:25 - 0:29:27::Oh, the aliens have their own tongue.
0:29:27 - 0:29:28::Before it down there.
0:29:28 - 0:29:29::Yeah, of course they do.
0:29:29 - 0:29:33::And this is where we're fucking up too.
0:29:33 - 0:29:35::Because guess what?
0:29:35 - 0:29:36::What?
0:29:36 - 0:29:38::A microplastic is harmless, right?
0:29:38 - 0:29:40::It's one microplastic.
0:29:40 - 0:29:41::Sure, that's what they say.
0:29:41 - 0:29:42::They say it's whatever.
0:29:42 - 0:29:43::Yes.
0:29:43 - 0:29:48::Okay, so now, okay, so now what happens when you get 10 billion microplastics
0:29:48 - 0:29:51::and you put them together at the bottom of the ocean?
0:29:51 - 0:29:52::Right.
0:29:52 - 0:29:55::Now it's called a macroplastic or just plastic.
0:29:55 - 0:29:56::Right.
0:29:56 - 0:29:57::Then what?
0:29:57 - 0:30:00::You get this smart enough fish culture and you can see it.

0:30:00 - 0:30:03.600000::keep giving them resources, keep feeding them those resources.
0:30:03.600000 - 0:30:06.840000::See if they don't build a motherfucking death ray.
0:30:06.840000 - 0:30:08.340000::Okay, what are we trying now?
0:30:08.340000 - 0:30:10.240000::Fuck guns.
0:30:10.240000 - 0:30:14.880000::They were going, the fish could build a subatomic nuclear ship.
0:30:14.880000 - 0:30:15.720000::You know what I'm saying?
0:30:15.720000 - 0:30:16.720000::Oh, holy shit.
0:30:16.720000 - 0:30:17.720000::They go drive it around.
0:30:17.720000 - 0:30:18.720000::We're so worried about Russia.
0:30:18.720000 - 0:30:19.720000::We're worried about this and that.
0:30:19.720000 - 0:30:21.720000::Meanwhile, dolphins are out here using the fucking lobsters.
0:30:21.720000 - 0:30:22.720000::Right.
0:30:22.720000 - 0:30:25.720000::It's a nuclear robotic slave to go build the end of the world.
0:30:25.720000 - 0:30:27.320000::We thought we were against all aquatic creatures.
0:30:27.320000 - 0:30:30.400000::I would be the first one to man up that fucking.
0:30:30.400000 - 0:30:31.400000::That turret, dude.
0:30:31.400000 - 0:30:32.400000::I would be fucking there.
0:30:32.400000 - 0:30:35.640000::This is destroying the fucking lobsters.
0:30:35.640000 - 0:30:37.440000::You'd be lighting up the lobsters.
0:30:37.440000 - 0:30:38.440000::Lighting up the lobsters.
0:30:38.440000 - 0:30:41.040000::And I'd be there with the butter and the boiling water to catch you.
0:30:41.040000 - 0:30:43.040000::You know what's pathetic?
0:30:43.040000 - 0:30:46.120000::I was just thinking, I'm trying to name a fish.
0:30:46.120000 - 0:30:47.840000::All I know is fucking river fish.
0:30:47.840000 - 0:30:49.640000::I don't know the ocean fish.
0:30:49.640000 - 0:30:50.640000::Yeah, I know.
0:30:50.640000 - 0:30:51.640000::Try out.
0:30:51.640000 - 0:30:52.640000::Yeah, I know salmon.
0:30:52.640000 - 0:30:53.640000::Yeah, I know.
0:30:53.640000 - 0:30:54.640000::Perch while I.
0:30:54.640000 - 0:30:57.280000::Yeah, but those all live in our American lakes.
0:30:57.280000 - 0:30:58.280000::And in our lives.
0:30:58.280000 - 0:30:59.280000::I don't give a fuck.
0:30:59.280000 - 0:31:01.800000::I know I give a fuck too much freshwater, dude.
0:31:01.800000 - 0:31:04.440000::Which we're going to be discussing freshwater versus saltwater.
0:31:04.440000 - 0:31:05.840000::Stay away from freshwater.
0:31:05.840000 - 0:31:06.840000::Pote that.
0:31:06.840000 - 0:31:07.840000::Yeah, that is funny.
0:31:07.840000 - 0:31:10.320000::It's funny that they say freshwater is the best.
0:31:10.320000 - 0:31:13.400000::Even though that's where the brain eating amabas live.
0:31:13.400000 - 0:31:14.920000::Yeah, I wouldn't go in that.
0:31:14.920000 - 0:31:17.400000::Why do they say it's the best?
0:31:17.400000 - 0:31:21.280000::Yeah, that's what they're trying to say.
0:31:21.280000 - 0:31:22.280000::It's really.
0:31:22.280000 - 0:31:24.600000::It's all reasonably is a dog.
0:31:24.600000 - 0:31:28.160000::You know how we can't just go up to like a puddle and just drink out of it like we'd
0:31:28.160000 - 0:31:29.160000::fucking die.
0:31:29.160000 - 0:31:30.160000::That's what they tell.
0:31:30.160000 - 0:31:31.160000::Not a live and you can't.
0:31:31.160000 - 0:31:32.160000::Yeah, sure.
0:31:32.160000 - 0:31:34.160000::Yeah, we're familiar with that narrative.
0:31:34.160000 - 0:31:35.160000::Go on.
0:31:35.160000 - 0:31:40.760000::But due to your experience of just putting a straw in puddles, different puddles, you're
0:31:40.760000 - 0:31:41.760000::fine.
0:31:41.760000 - 0:31:42.760000::Yeah, different.
0:31:42.760000 - 0:31:43.760000::Yeah, but I just want to tell you.
0:31:43.760000 - 0:31:44.760000::I'll just switch it around.
0:31:44.760000 - 0:31:45.760000::Yeah, go ahead.
0:31:45.760000 - 0:31:46.760000::Oh, okay, okay.
0:31:46.760000 - 0:31:47.760000::Yeah.
0:31:47.760000 - 0:31:51.440000::But I saw a dog just just really slurped up.
0:31:51.440000 - 0:31:54.440000::The most disgusting puddle I've ever seen in my life.
0:31:54.440000 - 0:31:56.880000::And I was like, and you know what?
0:31:56.880000 - 0:32:00.440000::You probably fucking fine.
0:32:00.440000 - 0:32:04.920000::It probably is, but you know you're asked what have fucking the craziest diarrhea of your
0:32:04.920000 - 0:32:05.920000::life.
0:32:05.920000 - 0:32:12.880000::If you sipped up any fucking any pond, any fucking lake nearby, you went to the Hudson River,
0:32:12.880000 - 0:32:13.880000::okay?
0:32:13.880000 - 0:32:15.880000::Yeah, New York specific.
0:32:15.880000 - 0:32:16.880000::Nice.
0:32:16.880000 - 0:32:22.120000::You went in there and took a cup full of that shit and chugged it.
0:32:22.120000 - 0:32:23.080000::So here's where I'm going to tell you.
0:32:23.080000 - 0:32:26.040000::I called this follow the white rabbit.
0:32:26.040000 - 0:32:27.320000::You know what I'm saying?
0:32:27.320000 - 0:32:32.960000::You've been told that these are things that poison you can't break the rules.
0:32:32.960000 - 0:32:35.200000::Eric, I've lived in Palosanto.
0:32:35.200000 - 0:32:37.980000::That's the most pathetic looking Palosanto.
0:32:37.980000 - 0:32:40.960000::Yeah, this is the most like little ass dick Palosanto.
0:32:40.960000 - 0:32:43.320000::Oh, you think that's pathetic?
0:32:43.320000 - 0:32:44.320000::Come on.
0:32:44.320000 - 0:32:47.840000::Oh, we've been waiting for you.
0:32:47.840000 - 0:32:51.360000::Without the ancient herbs and sticks.
0:32:51.360000 - 0:32:56.080000::You got the roach clip that fucking that should have been that that's crazy.
0:32:56.080000 - 0:32:58.080000::That's not doing anything.
0:32:58.080000 - 0:33:02.680000::No, man, a forest fire of all Palosanto fucking.
0:33:02.680000 - 0:33:03.680000::Oh, my God.
0:33:03.680000 - 0:33:08.160000::Okay, so here's the things every atrocity that happened on that land.
0:33:08.160000 - 0:33:10.480000::That's what we need to do.
0:33:10.480000 - 0:33:14.240000::This is a couple of things Nate, to take it back to this.
0:33:14.240000 - 0:33:18.400000::A, is diary about for you or are you getting toxins out of your body that you could never
0:33:18.400000 - 0:33:19.400000::have imagined?
0:33:19.400000 - 0:33:20.400000::That's why it's so violent.
0:33:20.400000 - 0:33:23::Reframe your perspective.
0:33:23 - 0:33:24::Wow.
0:33:24 - 0:33:25::Reframe your reality.
0:33:25 - 0:33:28.600000::Break the frame and accept that the painting actually expands the whole universe.
0:33:28.600000 - 0:33:30.600000::Okay, there's no such thing as a frame.
0:33:30.600000 - 0:33:31.600000::Oh, yeah.
0:33:31.600000 - 0:33:35.400000::The next thing is that's right.
0:33:35.400000 - 0:33:36.400000::Joy tactics.
0:33:36.400000 - 0:33:38.920000::The next thing is what I'm going to say.
0:33:38.920000 - 0:33:40.440000::The next thing is about old people.
0:33:40.440000 - 0:33:42.720000::Oh, yeah, to take it back to old people.
0:33:42.720000 - 0:33:45.400000::Let's bring it back to them.
0:33:45.400000 - 0:33:46.400000::Okay.
0:33:46.400000 - 0:33:48.840000::Well, old people is derogatory now.
0:33:48.840000 - 0:33:53.120000::It can also say the amount of people who said good job for sticking to the topic on the
0:33:53.120000 - 0:33:56.960000::cars episode.
0:33:56.960000 - 0:33:57.960000::It almost hurt my feelings.
0:33:57.960000 - 0:34:01.240000::It felt like almost insulting to see people coming.
0:34:01.240000 - 0:34:03.600000::Well, that's not that's not hard to do.
0:34:03.600000 - 0:34:04.600000::Right now.
0:34:04.600000 - 0:34:08.040000::It's really easy to stick to a topic, but we like to go off on different tangents.
0:34:08.040000 - 0:34:09.480000::How would you like it if we did this?
0:34:09.480000 - 0:34:11.120000::Oh, wow, it's been 34 minutes.
0:34:11.120000 - 0:34:12.120000::Good job.
0:34:12.120000 - 0:34:13.120000::Good job for listening this long.
0:34:13.120000 - 0:34:14.920000::You fucking saw these TikToks, right?
0:34:14.920000 - 0:34:15.920000::Right.
0:34:15.920000 - 0:34:16.920000::Wow, you finally did it.
0:34:16.920000 - 0:34:19.840000::You finally listened to something that was 30 minutes long instead of just watching TikTok
0:34:19.840000 - 0:34:22.320000::clips of fucking jelly beans over and over again.
0:34:22.320000 - 0:34:23.320000::Bitch.
0:34:23.320000 - 0:34:25.120000::We are giving the listeners too much power.
0:34:25.120000 - 0:34:28.160000::I think we're just, we're referencing them.
0:34:28.160000 - 0:34:33.680000::We are, I think we need to disengage from our audience completely.
0:34:33.680000 - 0:34:34.960000::Let's scare them for a second.
0:34:34.960000 - 0:34:36.280000::Not like any more.
0:34:36.280000 - 0:34:40.200000::There's no more likes on no more responding to any comments.
0:34:40.200000 - 0:34:41.200000::This is this.
0:34:41.200000 - 0:34:45.360000::No more fucking I'm not I've been zelling about 45 you all.
0:34:45.360000 - 0:34:50.560000::I'm trying to hit you with rent and utility shit because the stories that you told me and
0:34:50.560000 - 0:34:52.920000::at this point I feel almost taking advantage of.
0:34:52.920000 - 0:34:53.920000::Okay.
0:34:53.920000 - 0:34:55.640000::And it's getting to a breaking point.
0:34:55.640000 - 0:34:56.640000::Those are all.
0:34:56.640000 - 0:34:57.640000::Yeah.
0:34:57.640000 - 0:34:58.640000::Yeah.
0:34:58.640000 - 0:35:00::And it's like all sexy girl like just all.

0:35:00 - 0:35:01.640000::I'll clearly use AI.
0:35:04.520000 - 0:35:06.740000::But we did meet the creator of the Joy-Tanked
0:35:06.740000 - 0:35:08.260000::and so we should shut out to the kids.
0:35:08.260000 - 0:35:10.240000::Oh yeah, that was awesome shut out to that.
0:35:10.240000 - 0:35:11.240000::Yeah.
0:35:11.240000 - 0:35:13.340000::OK, Jack, I don't know if you're just so sorry.
0:35:13.340000 - 0:35:14::Go back to that.
0:35:14 - 0:35:16.640000::It's literally not even a problem because my thoughts are so
0:35:16.640000 - 0:35:18::just right on deck.
0:35:18 - 0:35:20.840000::So what I was saying was, oh yeah.
0:35:20.840000 - 0:35:23.040000::So the dog eats the puddle, right?
0:35:23.040000 - 0:35:23.880000::Right.
0:35:23.880000 - 0:35:24.380000::Remember that.
0:35:24.380000 - 0:35:26.880000::This is so bad or drinks rather.
0:35:26.880000 - 0:35:31.280000::So then to take it all the way back to take it all the way back.
0:35:31.280000 - 0:35:31.800000::So sorry.
0:35:31.800000 - 0:35:32.960000::So old people.
0:35:32.960000 - 0:35:33.440000::OK, yeah.
0:35:33.440000 - 0:35:34.480000::Stop.
0:35:34.480000 - 0:35:38.880000::To take it all the way back to the old people, eating food.
0:35:38.880000 - 0:35:43.680000::OK, Eric's Nan, 93 eating fucking Doritos every day.
0:35:43.680000 - 0:35:47.120000::OK, my grandma, 96.
0:35:47.120000 - 0:35:51.520000::And then she passed in a wickedly violent way.
0:35:51.520000 - 0:35:54.240000::She was eating spaghetti and meatballs every single night,
0:35:54.240000 - 0:35:56.760000::drinking root beer every single day.
0:35:56.760000 - 0:35:59.200000::And she did a triathlon.
0:35:59.200000 - 0:36:02.880000::I think it must have been her 94th 95th birthday or something.
0:36:02.880000 - 0:36:06.120000::And Jack, I got to tell you, I don't think your grandma 96 did
0:36:06.120000 - 0:36:07.960000::a triathlon.
0:36:07.960000 - 0:36:10.320000::I have photos of it, dummy.
0:36:10.320000 - 0:36:12.480000::A triathlon?
0:36:12.480000 - 0:36:14.880000::Do you want to know what it consisted of?
0:36:14.880000 - 0:36:17.680000::Yeah.
0:36:17.680000 - 0:36:24.480000::So she got, I guess she went for a walk and then got into the pool
0:36:24.480000 - 0:36:28.720000::and did some more exercise and then started a bike.
0:36:28.720000 - 0:36:30.160000::No, chill.
0:36:30.160000 - 0:36:33.520000::Then she got on a, what do they call it?
0:36:33.520000 - 0:36:35::Like stationary bike.
0:36:35 - 0:36:36.240000::Yeah, stationary bike.
0:36:36.240000 - 0:36:39.800000::And there's a picture of her on a stationary bike with a bunch
0:36:39.800000 - 0:36:41.200000::of people kind of.
0:36:41.200000 - 0:36:42.240000::All right, that's impressive.
0:36:42.240000 - 0:36:43::That's impressive.
0:36:43 - 0:36:44.360000::And it's a nice.
0:36:44.360000 - 0:36:45.840000::OK.
0:36:45.840000 - 0:36:47.240000::Now, rest in peace to her.
0:36:51.080000 - 0:36:53.920000::But this is all I'm saying is the dogs.
0:36:54.880000 - 0:36:58.280000::That are shit water.
0:36:58.280000 - 0:37:00.080000::Maybe there's a reason they live so long, man.
0:37:00.080000 - 0:37:01.360000::That's all I got to say.
0:37:01.360000 - 0:37:02.480000::I know.
0:37:02.480000 - 0:37:05.080000::You look at a dog and you think, oh, they die early, though.
0:37:05.080000 - 0:37:07.080000::Don't they live less long than us?
0:37:07.080000 - 0:37:08.080000::OK.
0:37:08.080000 - 0:37:13.400000::But maybe they were actually going to go in the pit.
0:37:13.400000 - 0:37:14.400000::All the turtles are too.
0:37:14.400000 - 0:37:15.320000::Eating and drinking.
0:37:15.320000 - 0:37:17.680000::Oh, they're mostly getting straws up their nose.
0:37:17.680000 - 0:37:20.200000::You remember those videos where they have to pull the plastic
0:37:20.200000 - 0:37:22::straws out of their nose with a plier?
0:37:22 - 0:37:23::Oh.
0:37:23 - 0:37:23.800000::Oh, yeah.
0:37:23.800000 - 0:37:24.640000::That happened to me.
0:37:24.640000 - 0:37:28.320000::That's what we're doing to these beautiful creatures.
0:37:28.320000 - 0:37:31.880000::I saw a melted turtle in Prospect Park, a turtle that
0:37:31.880000 - 0:37:35.920000::had been disintegrated into jelly.
0:37:35.920000 - 0:37:40.040000::Well, that's a natural way that they leave us.
0:37:40.040000 - 0:37:42.280000::That's how they go naturally.
0:37:42.280000 - 0:37:43::Yeah, they're jealous.
0:37:43 - 0:37:49.360000::Can I say this about like, OK, on the flip side of like not
0:37:49.360000 - 0:37:51.440000::doing what you're told to live longer?
0:37:51.440000 - 0:37:52.440000::You know what I mean?
0:37:52.440000 - 0:37:54.920000::Like my nan is eating the Dutch baby pancakes, whatever,
0:37:54.920000 - 0:37:57.160000::breaking all the rules and yet she's older.
0:37:57.160000 - 0:38:00.200000::I do feel like when people that we know that are our age
0:38:00.200000 - 0:38:04.800000::pass away, I always have to justify it in my mind.
0:38:04.800000 - 0:38:06.080000::And this is so brutal.
0:38:06.080000 - 0:38:07.720000::This is just why.
0:38:07.720000 - 0:38:10::Because I have to think like, oh, they
0:38:10 - 0:38:11.840000::got that horrible disease in pass away.
0:38:11.840000 - 0:38:14.200000::Well, it's because they did this or that.
0:38:14.200000 - 0:38:16.160000::And actually, I'm not pharmacically.
0:38:16.160000 - 0:38:17.160000::You know what I mean?
0:38:17.160000 - 0:38:18.480000::You're saying, carmically?
0:38:18.480000 - 0:38:20.600000::No, not carmically, but just lifestyle-wise,
0:38:20.600000 - 0:38:23::even though I probably had one of the worst lifestyles
0:38:23 - 0:38:26.320000::out of anybody in our generation.
0:38:26.320000 - 0:38:28.880000::I somehow feel like justified in my mind
0:38:28.880000 - 0:38:31.800000::to think like, oh, well, there's a reason why they got.
0:38:31.800000 - 0:38:34.240000::But really, there's no rhyme or reason to being alive
0:38:34.240000 - 0:38:36.960000::and staying alive so much of this is luck and genetics.
0:38:36.960000 - 0:38:40.600000::And if the studies that we were talking about on COVID
0:38:40.600000 - 0:38:44.480000::are true, Jack, our generation is a ticking time bomb.
0:38:44.480000 - 0:38:44.960000::OK?
0:38:44.960000 - 0:38:46.720000::And we're not even going to make it to our fucking 50s.
0:38:46.720000 - 0:38:48.640000::So just enjoy it.
0:38:48.640000 - 0:38:51.320000::We're not going to get the pleasure of gray hair
0:38:51.320000 - 0:38:53.720000::and failing bodies because it's just going to hit us
0:38:53.720000 - 0:38:54.640000::really quick.
0:38:54.640000 - 0:38:58.240000::So everybody listening that's in their late 20s and 30s,
0:38:58.240000 - 0:38:59.760000::live it up right now because we don't
0:38:59.760000 - 0:39:01.280000::got as long as we think.
0:39:01.280000 - 0:39:02.440000::OK?
0:39:02.440000 - 0:39:05.760000::The AI doctors and formulas and calculations
0:39:05.760000 - 0:39:08.240000::are not going to save us.
0:39:08.240000 - 0:39:10.960000::Let us be a guiding light for you.
0:39:10.960000 - 0:39:11.560000::OK?
0:39:11.560000 - 0:39:15.400000::In the face of darkness and evil, what do you do?
0:39:15.400000 - 0:39:16.360000::Do you cover?
0:39:16.360000 - 0:39:17.360000::Do you hide?
0:39:17.360000 - 0:39:18.200000::No.
0:39:18.200000 - 0:39:21.600000::You fucking live it up in the craziest way.
0:39:21.600000 - 0:39:24::Go start a podcast today, man.
0:39:24 - 0:39:31.120000::Today, go rent a Dodge charger and drive it around
0:39:31.120000 - 0:39:33.400000::with two hours a day around Seattle.
0:39:33.400000 - 0:39:34.160000::OK?
0:39:34.160000 - 0:39:35::We didn't say.
0:39:35 - 0:39:35.840000::You picture together.
0:39:35.840000 - 0:39:39.400000::I'm a Pollo Santo.
0:39:39.400000 - 0:39:39.960000::Yeah.
0:39:39.960000 - 0:39:42.360000::Nate, you got a Dodge charger.
0:39:42.360000 - 0:39:43.160000::Yeah.
0:39:43.160000 - 0:39:45.080000::What was the, did you request that?
0:39:45.080000 - 0:39:45.600000::Or not?
0:39:45.600000 - 0:39:48.040000::The guy just hooked it up at the, at the fucking enterprise
0:39:48.040000 - 0:39:52.480000::because he's one of the people here at where comedians.
0:39:52.480000 - 0:39:55.120000::He said, oh, comedians, you mean modern day philosophical rock
0:39:55.120000 - 0:39:56.680000::stars?
0:39:56.680000 - 0:40:00.240000::You mean, you need, this is what my girlfriend said yesterday.

0:40:00 - 0:40:02.560000::She called us missionaries of laughter.
0:40:03.400000 - 0:40:06.440000::Oh, yeah. Oh, because I said we're going to the
0:40:06.440000 - 0:40:07::under the country.
0:40:07 - 0:40:09.040000::The leaders right we're going to this.
0:40:09.040000 - 0:40:09.480000::My wife.
0:40:09.480000 - 0:40:11.480000::We're not doing this for money.
0:40:11.480000 - 0:40:12.960000::We're not doing this for personal gain.
0:40:12.960000 - 0:40:13.520000::Nothing is.
0:40:13.520000 - 0:40:15.160000::Whatever, but guess what?
0:40:15.160000 - 0:40:16.840000::We're doing it for the larger cause.
0:40:17.120000 - 0:40:18.640000::We're evangelizing the.
0:40:20.400000 - 0:40:21.640000::Atheist essentially.
0:40:22.360000 - 0:40:24.280000::We're doing what do they call it?
0:40:25.240000 - 0:40:27.320000::When the Spanish people came over.
0:40:27.320000 - 0:40:29.400000::And what was that?
0:40:29.400000 - 0:40:31.800000::Oh, yeah, colonizing those are bad.
0:40:32.360000 - 0:40:33.040000::That's not good.
0:40:33.560000 - 0:40:34.600000::No, no, no, no.
0:40:35.280000 - 0:40:39.200000::Wait, so who's the most baddest old person you can think of that you are legit
0:40:39.200000 - 0:40:42.240000::thinking like God damn there.
0:40:42.240000 - 0:40:44.840000::A bit older, but yeah, I still like it like that.
0:40:45.560000 - 0:40:46.240000::Jim Carrey.
0:40:46.240000 - 0:40:46.720000::Shit.
0:40:47.080000 - 0:40:48.120000::Oh, you know who?
0:40:50.120000 - 0:40:52::Oh, she's mirroring Martha Stewart.
0:40:52 - 0:40:55.240000::Oh, and you know, I saw her in person, right?
0:40:56.160000 - 0:40:57.880000::Really in Vegas.
0:40:58.080000 - 0:41:03.920000::She was opening her new restaurant and I walked on by and there she was flawless.
0:41:05.080000 - 0:41:05.600000::Beautiful.
0:41:05.680000 - 0:41:06.520000::I'm not kidding you.
0:41:06.520000 - 0:41:09.320000::I am like very attracted to Martha Stewart.
0:41:09.840000 - 0:41:11.120000::All right, chill man.
0:41:11.760000 - 0:41:12.080000::Damn.
0:41:12.080000 - 0:41:13.760000::Let me Google image Martha Stewart real quick.
0:41:14.240000 - 0:41:15.480000::You don't got a picture in your mind.
0:41:16.560000 - 0:41:20.640000::No, you know, I know I had a crazy ass crush upon.

0:52:07.720000 - 0:52:08.720000::life.
0:52:08.720000 - 0:52:12.160000::You can't say that phrase and stay in my life.
0:52:12.160000 - 0:52:16::In me, I'm kind of more accepting and I, you know, that's why I wouldn't even bother
0:52:16 - 0:52:17::with you.
0:52:17 - 0:52:20.640000::So you know, you're the real tendency to surround yourself with losers.
0:52:20.640000 - 0:52:21.640000::What if Kat said it?
0:52:21.640000 - 0:52:24.520000::Well, what's funny is I do two, oh, that's funny.
0:52:24.520000 - 0:52:28.640000::I do two, but what's funny is I take losers and I turn them into princes and then I go
0:52:28.640000 - 0:52:29.920000::to get them to sell my products.
0:52:29.920000 - 0:52:30.920000::Do you understand?
0:52:30.920000 - 0:52:35.040000::So if somebody comes up to me and says, Hey man, today, what are, how's the weather up
0:52:35.040000 - 0:52:36.040000::there?
0:52:36.040000 - 0:52:39.400000::Something high wise joke or what was the phrase that you, we were just talking about
0:52:39.400000 - 0:52:40.400000::10 seconds ago?
0:52:40.400000 - 0:52:44.560000::Eric, you said you can't have nice things.
0:52:44.560000 - 0:52:49.200000::Okay, if somebody comes up to me and says, this is why we can't have nice things, I go,
0:52:49.200000 - 0:52:52.760000::come with me for a second.
0:52:52.760000 - 0:52:59::I sit them down, I have them open page one of Jackson credible world of phrases and I
0:52:59 - 0:53:07.280000::go turn to the chapter about the topic of, this is why we can't have nice things alternatives
0:53:07.280000 - 0:53:14.520000::basically and I just open their mind because that's an individual that is an asset.
0:53:14.520000 - 0:53:18.680000::You see individuals who are scarred, who are tortured, who have roughed tasks and you
0:53:18.680000 - 0:53:20.440000::say, get the way for me, they're losers.
0:53:20.440000 - 0:53:24.040000::I bring them in, man, because I like to send snakes into snake pits.
0:53:24.040000 - 0:53:25.840000::Okay, they don't send a sheep.
0:53:25.840000 - 0:53:27.360000::They'll get eaten alive.
0:53:27.360000 - 0:53:31.440000::And then you turn them into salesmen and then I turn them into businesses for my, yeah,
0:53:31.440000 - 0:53:33.200000::for my thought count.
0:53:33.200000 - 0:53:38.840000::Because if you have college debt, by the way, no, no, no, listen to me now.
0:53:38.840000 - 0:53:44.680000::If you have college debt, go ahead, send me an email and I have a cruise ship that we
0:53:44.680000 - 0:53:45.680000::can all go on.
0:53:45.680000 - 0:53:46.680000::It's really fun.
0:53:46.680000 - 0:53:50.320000::And by the end, you're going to have zero college debt.
0:53:50.320000 - 0:53:53.040000::It's so fucking, it's a great opportunity.
0:53:53.040000 - 0:53:58.680000::We need to do the joy tactics cruise, but it's clearly like an old ass fucking salvage
0:53:58.680000 - 0:54:02.640000::ship from the 1950s that can see it about 18 people.
0:54:02.640000 - 0:54:06.240000::It's fucking weak, but you got to fucking fuck it out water every second.
0:54:06.240000 - 0:54:08.280000::The foods are fucking boiled on my face.
0:54:08.280000 - 0:54:14.600000::We're going to have to sleep on the floor, except for us.
0:54:14.600000 - 0:54:17.040000::I want to go on a jungle cruise so bad.
0:54:17.040000 - 0:54:19.080000::You know how that movie jungle cruise?
0:54:19.080000 - 0:54:21.080000::It's one of the things.
0:54:21.080000 - 0:54:24.600000::It's like a jungle, what is a jungle cruise?
0:54:24.600000 - 0:54:29.120000::It's a cruise through the jungle through the river.
0:54:29.120000 - 0:54:30.120000::It's like the river?
0:54:30.120000 - 0:54:32.800000::Yeah, dude, but you never, it's like white water.
0:54:32.800000 - 0:54:35.360000::Oh, bro, let's go white water, after you too.
0:54:35.360000 - 0:54:38.760000::I'm a little bit close.
0:54:38.760000 - 0:54:40.120000::I literally would like to do it.
0:54:40.120000 - 0:54:41.600000::I have a feeling you would die.
0:54:41.600000 - 0:54:46.880000::I've done how hilarious that you did because I've already done it twice with my youth group,
0:54:46.880000 - 0:54:47.880000::bitch.
0:54:47.880000 - 0:54:49.880000::You're not a fucking guy.
0:54:49.880000 - 0:54:52.560000::The river guy said I was one of the most talented.
0:54:52.560000 - 0:54:55.360000::Yeah, you're not that young guy anymore, man.
0:54:55.360000 - 0:54:56.360000::You're not.
0:54:56.360000 - 0:54:58.280000::And I think we're going to let's go do these things, man.
0:54:58.280000 - 0:55:00::Okay, let's go sprint for five minutes.

0:55:00 - 0:55:01.840000::seconds and see if your legs, snaps and half.
0:55:01.840000 - 0:55:02.960000::Why is it fucking long?
0:55:02.960000 - 0:55:03.960000::You're being a C.A.
0:55:03.960000 - 0:55:05.880000::Let's panic attack because the sun won't set.
0:55:05.880000 - 0:55:07.640000::We should start a podcast.
0:55:07.640000 - 0:55:09.320000::Okay, guys, let's do it.
0:55:09.320000 - 0:55:11.080000::Yeah, that was my ass.
0:55:11.080000 - 0:55:13.200000::Let's, we should go to fucking long as being.
0:55:13.200000 - 0:55:14.640000::No, dude, it's not worth it.
0:55:14.640000 - 0:55:16.680000::It's gonna be fucking lame as hell.
0:55:16.680000 - 0:55:17.880000::Really?
0:55:17.880000 - 0:55:18.720000::We should go do this.
0:55:18.720000 - 0:55:21.680000::I'm always like, yo, let's go do this.
0:55:21.680000 - 0:55:24.360000::Why do I never get ideas from you guys?
0:55:24.360000 - 0:55:26.480000::Why do I always have to come with the idea?
0:55:26.480000 - 0:55:28.880000::It's becoming exhausting for me.
0:55:28.880000 - 0:55:31.320000::And I'm fucking getting weary and tired and all of a sudden,
0:55:31.320000 - 0:55:33.120000::you guys are gonna be like, man,
0:55:33.120000 - 0:55:34.840000::I asked you, months have been pretty boring.
0:55:34.840000 - 0:55:36.960000::Well, that's because I fucking stop trying.
0:55:36.960000 - 0:55:38.560000::Because I can't be more in a hurry.
0:55:38.560000 - 0:55:42.360000::Well, basically, the cold hard truth, man.
0:55:42.360000 - 0:55:45.880000::The cold hard truth is we have a lot of other things going on
0:55:45.880000 - 0:55:46.720000::in our lives.
0:55:46.720000 - 0:55:48.680000::It's not all the podcast for us.
0:55:48.680000 - 0:55:52.360000::Okay, we can't take six months off to go do a nuclear winter
0:55:52.360000 - 0:55:53.200000::in the northern.
0:55:53.200000 - 0:55:54.200000::It's a polar winter, dude.
0:55:54.200000 - 0:55:57.560000::It'll change your perspective on being alive.
0:55:57.560000 - 0:55:59.440000::I don't want to change my perspective on being alive.
0:55:59.440000 - 0:56:01.320000::I am perfect right now.
0:56:01.320000 - 0:56:05.080000::My gratefulness every single day is radiating out of my fucking body.
0:56:05.080000 - 0:56:06.080000::My life is so good.
0:56:06.080000 - 0:56:07.520000::My room is clean.
0:56:07.520000 - 0:56:08.480000::My sleep is good.
0:56:08.480000 - 0:56:10.240000::My blood pressure is on point.
0:56:10.240000 - 0:56:11.880000::Checked it this morning looking great.
0:56:11.880000 - 0:56:13.040000::What was the reading?
0:56:14.280000 - 0:56:18.080000::Is 128?
0:56:18.080000 - 0:56:20.080000::133 over 80 years old.
0:56:20.080000 - 0:56:20.920000::Bro, that's nothing.

0:56:21.760000 - 0:56:22.600000::That's chill.
0:56:22.600000 - 0:56:23.760000::When you wake up in the morning,
0:56:23.760000 - 0:56:26.800000::that's the perfect blood pressure to have.
0:56:26.800000 - 0:56:27.640000::Done.
0:56:27.640000 - 0:56:28.480000::I bet you out.
0:56:28.480000 - 0:56:30.800000::My ass is at 50 over 20.
0:56:30.800000 - 0:56:32.320000::50 over 20?
0:56:32.320000 - 0:56:33.760000::Clean.
0:56:33.760000 - 0:56:37.320000::Probably, probably is realistically.
0:56:40.080000 - 0:56:41.160000::Well, well, well.
0:56:41.160000 - 0:56:42.920000::I'm excited to eat food today.
0:56:42.920000 - 0:56:43.920000::I don't need to.
0:56:43.920000 - 0:56:46.880000::I'm gonna start doing two of my dad and my brother.
0:56:46.880000 - 0:56:47.880000::Told you to get that.
0:56:47.880000 - 0:56:48.960000::I blew slushy.
0:56:48.960000 - 0:56:50.480000::A blue icy.
0:56:50.480000 - 0:56:51.400000::Polar icy.
0:56:51.400000 - 0:56:53.760000::You know, you're gonna get the dune bucket.
0:56:53.760000 - 0:56:54.600000::Oh, is that?
0:56:55.440000 - 0:56:56.280000::Yeah.
0:56:56.280000 - 0:56:59.200000::You and your family all get the dune bucket together.
0:56:59.200000 - 0:57:01.280000::I'm kind of hitting it hard enough
0:57:01.280000 - 0:57:04.440000::to where we each get our own dune bucket.
0:57:04.440000 - 0:57:05.280000::The sandworm.
0:57:05.280000 - 0:57:06.280000::Oh, you're rich.

0:57:08.520000 - 0:57:11.200000::Oh, no, I'm about to go have a minute.
0:57:11.200000 - 0:57:14.080000::It's a beautiful day in New York.
0:57:14.080000 - 0:57:15.880000::It's 60 degrees outside.
0:57:15.880000 - 0:57:17.600000::It's about 60 degrees out.
0:57:17.600000 - 0:57:18.440000::LA fucking.

0:57:20.960000 - 0:57:22.040000::It's so pathetic.
0:57:22.040000 - 0:57:23.040000::That town is so over.
0:57:23.040000 - 0:57:24.200000::You're not even grateful.
0:57:24.200000 - 0:57:25.320000::You're not interested in Nate.
0:57:25.320000 - 0:57:27.920000::You're not even grateful, even though the weather's better
0:57:27.920000 - 0:57:28.760000::there.
0:57:28.760000 - 0:57:29.600000::Look at you.
0:57:29.600000 - 0:57:30.600000::Right.
0:57:30.600000 - 0:57:31.600000::Beatch.
0:57:31.600000 - 0:57:32.320000::You're dressed like a motherfucking shy guy.
0:57:32.320000 - 0:57:35.480000::Meanwhile, me and Eric, we're out.
0:57:35.480000 - 0:57:38.280000::It's finally, we're ready to go out and party.
0:57:38.280000 - 0:57:39.120000::Nate.
0:57:39.120000 - 0:57:40.120000::Well, you guys just don't.
0:57:40.120000 - 0:57:42.280000::I express gratitude and ways that are different
0:57:42.280000 - 0:57:44.640000::than you guys do.
0:57:44.640000 - 0:57:47.040000::You're kind of a nontraditional gratitude.
0:57:47.040000 - 0:57:48.920000::Oh, you do those through the movement palms
0:57:48.920000 - 0:57:50.560000::that you've been recording.
0:57:50.560000 - 0:57:51.560000::Exactly.
0:57:51.560000 - 0:57:52.560000::Exactly.
0:57:52.560000 - 0:57:53.560000::The silent movement palms.
0:57:53.920000 - 0:57:57.880000::Radio silence on when in the text thread.
0:57:57.880000 - 0:57:59.280000::Hey, man, love your improv show.
0:57:59.280000 - 0:58:01.480000::Just thought I'd send you this video to show you how much
0:58:01.480000 - 0:58:02.320000::I appreciate it is.
0:58:02.320000 - 0:58:05::It's fully naked, fully hard doing movement poetry.
0:58:07.480000 - 0:58:09.160000::And at the end, I say, I got a point.
0:58:13 - 0:58:14.320000::I'm loving.
0:58:14.320000 - 0:58:15.640000::OK.
0:58:15.640000 - 0:58:16.440000::We got a story.
0:58:16.440000 - 0:58:17.440000::I'll give you a story.
0:58:17.440000 - 0:58:18.280000::I'm going to give you a story.
0:58:18.280000 - 0:58:19.560000::Yeah, of course you can.
0:58:19.560000 - 0:58:20.960000::Because modern ought to be music-related.
0:58:20.960000 - 0:58:21.960000::It was quite amazing.
0:58:21.960000 - 0:58:23.680000::It was a good week to do it.
0:58:23.680000 - 0:58:27.520000::So I'm walking next to my apartment
0:58:27.520000 - 0:58:28.880000::about to go for a walk.
0:58:28.880000 - 0:58:36::And I see a line of very hip-led rests, people down the block
0:58:36 - 0:58:42.440000::going into laundry mat that I use on a bi-weekly basis.
0:58:42.440000 - 0:58:43.640000::And I'm like, what the fuck is this?
0:58:43.640000 - 0:58:45.920000::What kind of tick-tockery or some fucking,
0:58:45.920000 - 0:58:48.560000::is Addison Ray doing some fucking meet-and-greet
0:58:48.560000 - 0:58:50.200000::at my laundry mat?
0:58:50.920000 - 0:58:56.280000::And then I look on the front and who's, like, pop up,
0:58:56.280000 - 0:58:57.280000::is it?
0:58:57.280000 - 0:59:01.360000::Fay Webster, one of my favorite artists.
0:59:01.360000 - 0:59:04.520000::And on top of that, as I see that,
0:59:04.520000 - 0:59:07.200000::somebody comes out and guess who it is?
0:59:07.200000 - 0:59:08.720000::A joy-tactician.
0:59:08.720000 - 0:59:09.560000::John Cooom.
