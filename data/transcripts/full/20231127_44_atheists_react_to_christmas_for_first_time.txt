0:03:22.280000 - 0:03:24.520000::Basically, the, because we would have
0:03:24.520000 - 0:03:26.960000::all of our, I was on the same little league teams
0:03:26.960000 - 0:03:28.760000::as this kid, Chris.

0:03:39.920000 - 0:03:41.960000::Or I guess it would only be indoor.
0:03:41.960000 - 0:03:45.640000::What's Chris's last name is Jobs?
0:03:45.640000 - 0:03:47.720000::But basically, the story that I heard
0:03:47.720000 - 0:03:50.520000::is that his dad invented something for Boeing
0:03:50.520000 - 0:03:52.120000::that paid his ass out.

0:04:06.920000 - 0:04:10.600000::would use his money for fun shit.
0:04:10.600000 - 0:04:13.040000::We would ride around on, he had a gator.
0:04:13.040000 - 0:04:16.160000::Those maintenance trucks, those green little maintenance trucks
0:04:16.160000 - 0:04:19.720000::that they take around golf courses are college campuses.

0:04:20.400000 - 0:04:24.120000::He had one of those and he rigged like a potato gun
0:04:24.120000 - 0:04:24.960000::to be on the back.
0:04:24.960000 - 0:04:26.600000::You guys know what a potato gun is?
0:04:26.600000 - 0:04:28.040000::Gun that shoots potatoes.
0:04:28.040000 - 0:04:29.680000::It's like that big PVC pipe.
0:04:29.680000 - 0:04:31.160000::And then you like put hairspray in it
0:04:31.160000 - 0:04:32.840000::and then you, they like triggers
0:04:32.840000 - 0:04:36.120000::and it shoots potatoes like hell fast out of it like a tank.
0:04:36.120000 - 0:04:39.200000::You guys never seen the fifth, yeah.
0:04:39.200000 - 0:04:42.200000::Well, he rigged that to the back of it
0:04:42.200000 - 0:04:43.400000::and we'd ride around on that.
0:04:43.400000 - 0:04:45.320000::And like people in front would have airsoft guns
0:04:45.320000 - 0:04:46.280000::like shooting.
0:04:46.280000 - 0:04:47.280000::Eric.
0:04:47.280000 - 0:04:49.760000::And then the potato gun was in the,
0:04:49.760000 - 0:04:50.600000::I mean that's sick.
0:04:50.600000 - 0:04:51.440000::That's rich.
0:04:51.440000 - 0:04:53.960000::That sounds like a rich, what is this kid do now, Chris?
0:04:53.960000 - 0:04:55.080000::You know what?
0:04:55.080000 - 0:04:55.920000::He's dead.
0:04:55.920000 - 0:05:00::He is a contractor like a real estate developer.

0:05:00 - 0:05:05.360000::keep build houses. And I'm saying that's a good outcome for rich kid building
0:05:05.360000 - 0:05:08.560000::a fucking house with a big ass red truck. Good for him.
0:05:09.320000 - 0:05:13.840000::I wonder if he thinks of me. Were you only friends with him because of his
0:05:15 - 0:05:23.400000::wealth and money? Now he was like, I went to like a rich kids like evangelical
0:05:23.400000 - 0:05:27.040000::school I've talked about before. And we were not one of the rich families.
0:05:27.200000 - 0:05:31.880000::But all these families had fucking crazy Seattle wealth. And a lot of them were
0:05:31.880000 - 0:05:36.880000::bastards rat bastards. But he was the richest of them all. He was the king of the rich
0:05:36.880000 - 0:05:43::kids. Wow. And yet he was the nicest. So curious how that works. How very curious.
0:05:43.960000 - 0:05:46.840000::I'm trying to think of the richest. I was just, you know what I was just thinking was
0:05:46.840000 - 0:05:56.160000::like the richest friend I had like as their houses got a if you had three floors in your
0:05:56.160000 - 0:06:01.600000::house. I was a good it was usually pretty scary in there. Like the did you get dizzy when
0:06:01.600000 - 0:06:04.880000::you went in there? Did you get butterflies in your stomach? If you went to a three story house.
0:06:05.160000 - 0:06:10.600000::If no one was home, I would be excited. But if everybody was home, I'd be worried that
0:06:10.600000 - 0:06:16.120000::they were going to call the cops on each other or something was bad was going to happen.
0:06:16.120000 - 0:06:24.720000::Because the energy was always a bit off bit scary. Yeah. I'm trying to think of like
0:06:26.160000 - 0:06:34.800000::why is that? It's almost as if money can't buy me love. Can't buy me. Can't buy love.
0:06:35.480000 - 0:06:41.880000::You're uncorruptible. Yeah. You are. This is by the way, the point five speed episode.
0:06:42.800000 - 0:06:47.920000::We are reeling from a friend's giving right now. Reeling from a friend's giving.
0:06:49.040000 - 0:06:54.120000::And may I say this, this is triggered a memory in my brain. I remember going to my other
0:06:54.120000 - 0:06:58.120000::rich friend's house and his dad would put on his deodorant for him. And I was thinking,
0:06:58.840000 - 0:07:04.560000::what the fuck? A little too old for this. What? He was like, he would live to
0:07:04.560000 - 0:07:09.560000::his arm and he had to go like, put it on like this. And well, I don't remember what age,
0:07:09.560000 - 0:07:15.800000::but too old. Wow. And then my friend would go like, it's so cold. And I just felt disgusted
0:07:15.800000 - 0:07:23.160000::by it at my age. I thought this is a fucking not right behavior. Damn. I don't think I've heard
0:07:23.160000 - 0:07:27.960000::of that at any age. Yeah. I didn't. Why is that a thing? So in a sense, it doesn't sound
0:07:27.960000 - 0:07:32.520000::that that inappropriate that an adult's doing it because it would also sound weird if a kid
0:07:32.520000 - 0:07:36.200000::was doing it. Well, it's not even I don't even see it as inappropriate. Just something about
0:07:36.200000 - 0:07:41.640000::that exchange was disgusting. Because babies don't wear deodorant. You know, not the babies,
0:07:41.640000 - 0:07:45.640000::you know, but the babies, I know our fucking slide all cloned out. It's coming in. It's
0:07:45.640000 - 0:07:51.480000::melanchresh. Well, you know, you know, babies from all over the Southern region. Calvin Klein,
0:07:51.480000 - 0:07:57.720000::fucking yeah. The amount of babies that you follow from Riyadh on Instagram is not concerning,
0:07:57.720000 - 0:08:05.160000::but admirable. Shout out shout out to Riyadh and the print King Prince bin Solomon, whatever's
0:08:05.160000 - 0:08:10.440000::name is. Riyadh. All right, Mohammed bin Solomon. Nate, who is the richest kid you know,
0:08:10.440000 - 0:08:15::how did they pass away? Because a lot of them go quick, don't they? Don't you know, rich kid
0:08:15 - 0:08:20.040000::that died? Couple. I'm trying to say I feel like you told me the story about a rich kid that died
0:08:20.040000 - 0:08:27.800000::badly. Me? Mm-hmm. Choking on caviar or some shit. Ah, that would, man. Let's slow down. Let's
0:08:27.800000 - 0:08:35.880000::slow down. Let's slow down. Now, now, now, now. Nate, no, there you. What? No, no, no, no, no, no.
0:08:35.880000 - 0:08:42.520000::I was going to do enough. There was one like really, there was one like mega wealthy kid at my school.
0:08:42.520000 - 0:08:51::And everyone was just clearly friends with him because he was rich. Like it was just so,
0:08:52.360000 - 0:08:58.040000::the power, I've never been more aware of the power dynamic in a friendship due to
0:08:59.480000 - 0:09:05.640000::money than with this kid. Like it just felt like you were a servant and you were just like
0:09:05.640000 - 0:09:13.080000::lucky to be there. And if you, and if you were anything less than what he wanted, you were,
0:09:13.080000 - 0:09:19.880000::you were gone out of his, his premises. And I only got to go onto his property like one time.
0:09:20.760000 - 0:09:28.360000::What's your favorite? Well, how did I behave? When you were, did you fix your,
0:09:28.360000 - 0:09:31.160000::you're like, did you dress differently and try and like impress them?
0:09:31.320000 - 0:09:37.400000::I was just kind of trying to like, one, I didn't really care because you know, I don't give a
0:09:37.400000 - 0:09:42.680000::fuck about that shit. And I was like, this kid was just like, I was like, whatever, you know,

0:09:53.800000 - 0:10:00.040000::And we're in his like kind of like drug den, like back, like cabin of his property.

0:10:00 - 0:10:03::and there was like all this fucking bags of weed

0:10:08.200000 - 0:10:11.120000::Beer, natural liquor.
0:10:11.120000 - 0:10:14.200000::Can we have one party, one joke tight days party with a kid?
0:10:14.200000 - 0:10:15.760000::I haven't been to a party with a kid.
0:10:15.760000 - 0:10:18.320000::And so fucking long, just side note.
0:10:18.320000 - 0:10:19.160000::I wanna go to the party.
0:10:19.160000 - 0:10:22.680000::You wanna do a kid stand, have aneurysm upside down.
0:10:22.680000 - 0:10:23.880000::Wouldn't happen to me.
0:10:23.880000 - 0:10:26.120000::So what happened to the rich kid that you knew,
0:10:26.120000 - 0:10:27.880000::what's he doing now?
0:10:27.880000 - 0:10:29.240000::You know what, I don't,
0:10:29.240000 - 0:10:32.480000::I wanna say he's actually in real estate as well.
0:10:32.480000 - 0:10:34.320000::Like I swear to God.
0:10:34.320000 - 0:10:35.160000::That's where they go.
0:10:35.160000 - 0:10:36.920000::That's a thing of theme here.
0:10:36.920000 - 0:10:40::But I think he, I don't know what happened to him.
0:10:40 - 0:10:41.720000::Like he wasn't in my grade one.
0:10:41.720000 - 0:10:44.800000::So I wasn't like too close with them.
0:10:44.800000 - 0:10:47.360000::I have some demon that I need to face about all these kids
0:10:47.360000 - 0:10:48.600000::I went to elementary school with
0:10:48.600000 - 0:10:52.240000::because they will be in my dreams non-stop.
0:10:53.240000 - 0:10:54.080000::What do you mean?
0:10:54.080000 - 0:10:55.080000::I'll just say that now.
0:10:55.080000 - 0:10:58.080000::Well, I never felt like I matched up.
0:10:58.080000 - 0:11:00.400000::I never felt good enough to be around them.
0:11:00.400000 - 0:11:01.480000::That's right.
0:11:01.480000 - 0:11:04.360000::Well, maybe you should have been held back like me.
0:11:04.360000 - 0:11:05.320000::I probably should have been
0:11:05.320000 - 0:11:07.360000::then I wanna add a little more power.
0:11:07.360000 - 0:11:09::But I remember, I went,
0:11:09 - 0:11:11.360000::because I went K through eighth
0:11:11.360000 - 0:11:15.320000::to this evangelical Christian school called Kings Schools.
0:11:15.320000 - 0:11:17.120000::I think I've talked about it before.
0:11:17.120000 - 0:11:21.760000::Then I went to public school, Edmundswoodway High School.
0:11:21.760000 - 0:11:24.520000::And I still had a couple of friends at King's.
0:11:24.520000 - 0:11:27.440000::So once in a while I would go back to the King's parties.
0:11:27.440000 - 0:11:30.800000::But I would kind of pretend to act like hardened
0:11:30.800000 - 0:11:31.800000::by public school.
0:11:31.800000 - 0:11:33.640000::I'm so different now.
0:11:33.640000 - 0:11:38.280000::I might like one of the girls,
0:11:38.280000 - 0:11:41.920000::dads owned the Mercedes dealership in town.
0:11:41.920000 - 0:11:45.720000::Okay, and she had a crazy ass mother fucking house.
0:11:45.720000 - 0:11:47.120000::And I remember going back there
0:11:47.120000 - 0:11:48.160000::and they were playing music,
0:11:48.160000 - 0:11:49.360000::interbrows and the hot tubs.
0:11:49.360000 - 0:11:52.760000::And I was like, they're not gonna believe me,
0:11:52.760000 - 0:11:55.320000::you know, how much I've changed.
0:11:55.320000 - 0:11:57.400000::And then I'm really nobody really talked to me.
0:11:57.440000 - 0:11:58.720000::Still.
0:11:58.720000 - 0:12:01.200000::Wow, what would you be like lashing out,
0:12:01.200000 - 0:12:03.160000::like getting naked in the hot tub and shit like?
0:12:03.160000 - 0:12:05.480000::No, I was afraid to take my shirt off.
0:12:05.480000 - 0:12:06.400000::So that's even cool.
0:12:06.400000 - 0:12:08.280000::You'd put a leather jacket on in the hot tub.
0:12:08.280000 - 0:12:09.920000::You'd be like, I'm gonna fuck.
0:12:09.920000 - 0:12:11.400000::Yeah, I literally don't do a fuck.
0:12:11.400000 - 0:12:13.040000::I'm so high right now.
0:12:13.040000 - 0:12:14.560000::Wow.
0:12:14.560000 - 0:12:18.720000::I had a summer once where I was like,
0:12:18.720000 - 0:12:21.720000::I'm about to change up my whole fucking swag.
0:12:21.720000 - 0:12:23.720000::And I'm gonna go into this,
0:12:23.720000 - 0:12:26.520000::I'm gonna go into this fucking into seventh grade
0:12:26.600000 - 0:12:28.600000::as a new person.
0:12:28.600000 - 0:12:30.120000::I'm not gonna fucking,

0:12:33.920000 - 0:12:36.360000::and I was like, this is the time to like fucking.
0:12:36.360000 - 0:12:38.760000::You know, I feel like this, this, I feel like
0:12:38.760000 - 0:12:41.720000::I'm in the seventh grade of my adult life right now
0:12:41.720000 - 0:12:42.720000::in a way.
0:12:42.720000 - 0:12:43.560000::Wow.

0:12:54 - 0:12:54.840000::Oh.
0:12:54.840000 - 0:12:59.480000::Oh, that is so sweet and sad.
0:12:59.480000 - 0:13:01.680000::Did it smell like shit because you wore it every day?
0:13:01.680000 - 0:13:05.240000::I did wear all the fucking time.
0:13:05.240000 - 0:13:06.080000::Yeah.
0:13:06.080000 - 0:13:08.080000::And it was like the first piece of clothing
0:13:08.080000 - 0:13:12.960000::that I ever had that was like had any sense of swag to it
0:13:12.960000 - 0:13:13.800000::at all.
0:13:13.800000 - 0:13:18.560000::Like it was like all Walmart or, uh, like a JC penny out with it.
0:13:18.560000 - 0:13:19.400000::JC penny.
0:13:19.400000 - 0:13:20.400000::Yup.

0:13:22.400000 - 0:13:24.280000::But okay, so I went into that year
0:13:24.280000 - 0:13:27.440000::and I was like this, like I'm, I'm not hanging out
0:13:27.440000 - 0:13:28.840000::with fucking losers anymore.
0:13:28.840000 - 0:13:31.160000::Like this is it.
0:13:31.160000 - 0:13:34::Like I'm going to try and weasel my way into the cool group.
0:13:35.040000 - 0:13:40.680000::And the day, day one of seventh grade, I not only did I not
0:13:40.680000 - 0:13:44.560000::get into the, you know, the good table at lunch, like the
0:13:44.560000 - 0:13:45.720000::popular kids table.
0:13:45.720000 - 0:13:46.800000::I remember looking at it.
0:13:46.800000 - 0:13:48.400000::Literally this is like a visceral.
0:13:48.680000 - 0:13:52.360000::I was looking at the table where in my Hollister shirt
0:13:52.640000 - 0:13:55.120000::with my fucking, I was already balding at this point.
0:13:55.120000 - 0:13:55.920000::So I was called.
0:13:56.720000 - 0:14:02.920000::Hairgel had massive amounts of hair gel in braces looking at
0:14:02.920000 - 0:14:03.920000::the cool kids table.
0:14:03.920000 - 0:14:04.440000::Yeah.
0:14:04.680000 - 0:14:09.200000::And I was looking around at the table that I had ended up on.
0:14:09.760000 - 0:14:15.760000::And I was at I kid you not the fucking most bogus busted.
0:14:16.760000 - 0:14:21.320000::The dumbest and the just the worst possible lunch table you
0:14:21.320000 - 0:14:22.680000::could imagine at the school.
0:14:22.680000 - 0:14:25.840000::There wasn't a there wasn't a table that was worse than
0:14:25.840000 - 0:14:26.080000::this.
0:14:26.080000 - 0:14:27.120000::Your bottom tier.
0:14:27.520000 - 0:14:31.080000::I was bottom tier after this whole fucking the whole summer.
0:14:31.080000 - 0:14:34.400000::I was trying to just get mentally prepared that was like,
0:14:34.400000 - 0:14:35.200000::well, this is it.
0:14:35.200000 - 0:14:37.040000::Like I'm about to be into the, you know,
0:14:37.040000 - 0:14:39.680000::probably about to be in a new crew with new friends.
0:14:39.920000 - 0:14:43.880000::I had like some, I had some major swag going in the sixth grade.
0:14:45.240000 - 0:14:46.320000::And so I don't know.
0:14:46.320000 - 0:14:48.480000::Somehow I fumbled that one big time.
0:14:48.920000 - 0:14:50.400000::And it was all downhill from there.
0:14:50.800000 - 0:14:51.800000::Oh God.
0:14:52.560000 - 0:14:56.440000::Well, I remember I really quick on that on the Hollister shirt
0:14:56.440000 - 0:14:59.360000::tip one time I sit for my birthday.

0:15:00 - 0:15:06::I used my birthday money to buy a brown volcom t-shirt from zoomies.
0:15:06 - 0:15:07.600000::How'd you just pronounce that?
0:15:07.600000 - 0:15:08.600000::Volcom.
0:15:08.600000 - 0:15:11.600000::How do you say, Volcom?
0:15:11.600000 - 0:15:12.600000::Volcom?
0:15:12.600000 - 0:15:15.840000::Yeah, but that's just how I would say it on the East Coast, probably.
0:15:15.840000 - 0:15:16.840000::Oh yeah.
0:15:16.840000 - 0:15:19.040000::On the West Coast, dude, it's Volcom.
0:15:19.040000 - 0:15:21.880000::Anyway, it was a brown, volcom.
0:15:21.880000 - 0:15:26.800000::Sure, you know that crazy logo and the logo was all up on the shirt.
0:15:26.800000 - 0:15:28.120000::And I wore it every day.
0:15:28.120000 - 0:15:31.240000::I wore it so much that it would be like being a laundry and then I'd pick it out without
0:15:31.240000 - 0:15:32.240000::even washing it.
0:15:32.240000 - 0:15:33.240000::Yeah.
0:15:33.240000 - 0:15:36.640000::And then I guess one time it was just, it had been sitting in a laundry.
0:15:36.640000 - 0:15:40.480000::I didn't, I wanted to wear it so bad for this party.
0:15:40.480000 - 0:15:42.400000::And I wore it to the party.
0:15:42.400000 - 0:15:44.400000::Just it was a little damned and didn't think anything of it.
0:15:44.400000 - 0:15:48.080000::And I remember people being like, what is that fucking smell?
0:15:48.080000 - 0:15:51.080000::And it was mild, the mildew from my t-shirt.
0:15:51.080000 - 0:15:54.560000::Oh, that I wanted to wear.
0:15:54.560000 - 0:15:56.840000::That's so bad.
0:15:56.840000 - 0:15:58.760000::That's so sad.
0:15:58.760000 - 0:16:00.720000::That is not good.
0:16:00.720000 - 0:16:05.680000::But these are the, this is what makes us the men that we are today, right?
0:16:05.680000 - 0:16:06.680000::Yeah.
0:16:06.680000 - 0:16:11.640000::Because we'll name it as podcasters, creatives.
0:16:11.640000 - 0:16:13.640000::Entrepreneurs, watching Shartank every day.
0:16:13.640000 - 0:16:16.040000::Entrepreneurial, friends.
0:16:16.040000 - 0:16:20.800000::So Nate, where do you think the people at that table?
0:16:20.800000 - 0:16:23.480000::Where do you think they are now?
0:16:23.480000 - 0:16:27.560000::You know what, what table of life are they saying that?
0:16:27.560000 - 0:16:29.680000::And which one are you saying that?
0:16:29.680000 - 0:16:34.640000::I honestly think everyone at that table, this is a great question, Jack.
0:16:34.640000 - 0:16:40.200000::Because I think everyone at that table is doing really well.
0:16:40.200000 - 0:16:46.480000::Because I remember on Facebook the other day, one of them had a full beard in the seventh
0:16:46.480000 - 0:16:47.480000::grade.
0:16:47.480000 - 0:16:51.280000::He was one of the, the hairy ass people on the, hairier than me, man.
0:16:51.280000 - 0:16:53.280000::Like this guy had a full beard.
0:16:53.280000 - 0:16:54.960000::Like what was the hairline looking like?
0:16:54.960000 - 0:16:57::Is it deep down to the eyebrows?
0:16:57 - 0:17:02.040000::He actually did have a really deep hairline actually.
0:17:02.040000 - 0:17:03.040000::Good for him, man.
0:17:03.040000 - 0:17:04.040000::You know this guy?
0:17:04.040000 - 0:17:05.040000::Good for him.
0:17:05.040000 - 0:17:06.040000::God smiles on some of us.
0:17:06.040000 - 0:17:12.080000::Well, but I think everyone is doing pretty well.
0:17:12.080000 - 0:17:13.640000::And not oh, this is just a man.
0:17:13.640000 - 0:17:14.640000::Oh God.
0:17:14.640000 - 0:17:18::There was just one, this one guy, he was like the valid Victorian.
0:17:18 - 0:17:21.080000::Like, like that is where you're like, what would you say?
0:17:21.080000 - 0:17:22.080000::Smartest person.
0:17:22.080000 - 0:17:23.080000::Yeah, what'd you call it?
0:17:24 - 0:17:25::So is it?
0:17:25 - 0:17:26.200000::Valid Victorian.
0:17:26.200000 - 0:17:27.040000::Valid Victorian.
0:17:27.040000 - 0:17:28.240000::How do you say this?
0:17:28.240000 - 0:17:30.960000::The valid Victorian.
0:17:30.960000 - 0:17:32.480000::The valid Victorian.
0:17:32.480000 - 0:17:33.800000::The valid Victorian?
0:17:33.800000 - 0:17:34.800000::What is it?
0:17:34.800000 - 0:17:35.800000::One word from my saying it?
0:17:35.800000 - 0:17:37.560000::Or what are you saying, the valid Victorian?
0:17:37.560000 - 0:17:41.360000::I don't even know, the valid Victorian.
0:17:41.360000 - 0:17:42.320000::What's that?
0:17:42.320000 - 0:17:50.760000::Well, how do you say it?
0:17:50.760000 - 0:17:52.520000::The valid Victorian.
0:17:52.520000 - 0:17:54.080000::the valid Dictorian.
0:17:54.080000 - 0:17:55.080000::Yeah.
0:17:55.080000 - 0:17:55.920000::Really?
0:17:55.920000 - 0:17:57.160000::The valid Dictorian.
0:17:57.160000 - 0:17:59.760000::The valid Dictorian.
0:17:59.760000 - 0:18:01.440000::The valid Dictorian.
0:18:01.440000 - 0:18:04.760000::I mean, we don't need to squabble on this.
0:18:04.760000 - 0:18:05.600000::We are.
0:18:05.600000 - 0:18:07::Nobody is questioning.
0:18:07 - 0:18:08.160000::Yeah.
0:18:08.160000 - 0:18:14.640000::Anyways, this is one of the first grinding nights of my life.
0:18:14.640000 - 0:18:15.680000::You know what I'm saying?
0:18:15.680000 - 0:18:17.120000::Well, I wasn't grinding.
0:18:17.120000 - 0:18:21.920000::I was grinding potential at this dance.
0:18:21.920000 - 0:18:23.320000::It was like one of the first dances.
0:18:23.320000 - 0:18:24.600000::So I was like, holy shit.
0:18:24.600000 - 0:18:28.200000::Like, I could fucking grind tonight.
0:18:28.200000 - 0:18:32.720000::This is, I was so fucking hyped watching other people grind,
0:18:32.720000 - 0:18:34.520000::watching teachers, you know, come in.
0:18:34.520000 - 0:18:36.400000::No, you can't grind.
0:18:36.400000 - 0:18:37.400000::Yeah, you can't grind like that.
0:18:37.400000 - 0:18:38.720000::Do it like this.
0:18:38.720000 - 0:18:39.720000::And teach you.
0:18:39.720000 - 0:18:40.720000::Where are you?
0:18:40.720000 - 0:18:43.680000::Where are you getting all bricked up?
0:18:43.680000 - 0:18:44.760000::Not mad, bricked up.
0:18:44.760000 - 0:18:48.120000::No, but there is the valid Dictorian.
0:18:48.120000 - 0:18:48.960000::Do it.
0:18:48.960000 - 0:18:50.200000::Teacher of valid Dictorian.
0:18:50.200000 - 0:18:55.880000::He was following me around ruining all swag that I had the entire time.
0:18:55.880000 - 0:19:00.160000::Like, I was trying to go to, you know, the area where why?
0:19:00.160000 - 0:19:01.160000::Why was he?
0:19:01.160000 - 0:19:04::This guy wouldn't fucking, he wouldn't leave me alone.
0:19:04 - 0:19:06.480000::And I was trying to lose him the whole fucking dance.
0:19:06.480000 - 0:19:08.600000::So I could get my fucking, so I could grind.
0:19:08.600000 - 0:19:11.520000::Is that is the valid Dictorian?
0:19:11.520000 - 0:19:14.880000::Some the person who has the best grades.
0:19:14.880000 - 0:19:15.880000::It's the single person.
0:19:15.880000 - 0:19:17.160000::It's not even just grades.
0:19:17.160000 - 0:19:18.240000::It's lifestyle too.
0:19:18.240000 - 0:19:23.040000::So you got to, you got to factor in extracurriculars because if you're just great, you're not going
0:19:23.040000 - 0:19:24.040000::to be valid Dictorian.
0:19:24.040000 - 0:19:25.040000::Okay.
0:19:25.040000 - 0:19:26.840000::It's got to be extracurricular too.
0:19:26.840000 - 0:19:27.840000::All right.
0:19:27.840000 - 0:19:28.840000::I understand.
0:19:28.840000 - 0:19:29.840000::Did I have a dance story?
0:19:29.840000 - 0:19:30.840000::I'm not kidding.
0:19:30.840000 - 0:19:34.040000::Wait, so then what happened at the end of the, he followed you around all night like
0:19:34.040000 - 0:19:36.280000::a loser and then he, you didn't get to grind?
0:19:36.280000 - 0:19:42.920000::Well, I eventually lost him by like kind of like just literally it was like an escape.
0:19:42.920000 - 0:19:45.320000::He did this as an extreme blending into the car.
0:19:45.320000 - 0:19:46.320000::Yeah.
0:19:46.320000 - 0:19:47.320000::He'll save him.
0:19:47.320000 - 0:19:53.560000::And even then I was like, I feel like I was maybe at that point I was like, well, I have
0:19:53.560000 - 0:19:59.040000::an excuse of why I didn't grind because he was following me around all the time.
0:19:59.040000 - 0:20:00.040000::But now I have no excuse.

0:20:00 - 0:20:02::Why am I not grinding right now?
0:20:02 - 0:20:04::So yeah.
0:20:04 - 0:20:06::Have you grinded?
0:20:06 - 0:20:08::Did you get to grind?
0:20:08 - 0:20:10::Yeah, I've been grinding since.
0:20:10 - 0:20:12::When's the last time you were grinding?
0:20:12 - 0:20:14::When is the last time you were grinding?
0:20:14 - 0:20:16::Damn, too long.
0:20:16 - 0:20:18::I'll tell you what, too long, man.
0:20:18 - 0:20:20::Hey, let's hit the clerbs.
0:20:20 - 0:20:22::We got to take a trip to the Caribbean just to go grinding.
0:20:22 - 0:20:24::I'm trying to judge.
0:20:24 - 0:20:26::At grinding trip.
0:20:26 - 0:20:28::Can you grind? You can grind by yourself.
0:20:28 - 0:20:30::Grind with grind all by yourself.
0:20:30 - 0:20:32::You can grind by yourself by the way.
0:20:32 - 0:20:34::Grind with yourself.
0:20:34 - 0:20:36::Grind on you.
0:20:36 - 0:20:40::I'm telling you, when I was on the cruise ship in the Caribbean people are grinding and these clubs.
0:20:40 - 0:20:42::Yeah.
0:20:42 - 0:20:46::Locals and also cruise tourists are grinding like their life depends on it.
0:20:46 - 0:20:48::I'll tell you that much.
0:20:48 - 0:20:50::That's where you go grind.
0:20:50 - 0:20:52::It might.
0:20:52 - 0:20:54::Imagine that movie.
0:20:54 - 0:20:56::That's how I'm going to grind it.
0:20:56 - 0:20:58::Double in sexy.
0:20:58 - 0:21:00::What was your dance story, Jack?
0:21:00 - 0:21:02::Well, now I have two.
0:21:02 - 0:21:04::It's fucked up.
0:21:04 - 0:21:06::One's going to be a really short one about grinding.
0:21:06 - 0:21:10::And then the other one's going to be about a dance.
0:21:10 - 0:21:16::Basically, I don't want to name this person but I was at a party one time in college in Chicago.
0:21:16 - 0:21:22::And it was a party where there was music playing but nobody was dancing.
0:21:22 - 0:21:24::All the lights were on.
0:21:24 - 0:21:26::We're in an apartment in uptown.
0:21:26 - 0:21:28::Normal is all get out probably 20 people there.
0:21:28 - 0:21:30::And all of a sudden I turned around.
0:21:30 - 0:21:34::And I didn't really know everybody there but one of my friends was
0:21:34 - 0:21:42::leaning back on like hands on the counter of the kitchen kitchen counter like this.
0:21:42 - 0:21:44::And he was grinding like this.
0:21:44 - 0:21:48::Oh, oh, the crab in there.
0:21:48 - 0:21:50::Doing the crab in there.
0:21:50 - 0:21:54::But they're just in the kitchen with many other people just standing in there.
0:21:54 - 0:21:55::Do we know this person?
0:21:55 - 0:21:57::Lights on. You do know this person.
0:21:57 - 0:22:00::They're standing in there grinding.
0:22:00 - 0:22:04::And then I want this person to know if they're listening to this.
0:22:04 - 0:22:06::This is a funny story and I love this about them.
0:22:06 - 0:22:08::And then the girl was like asked them like,
0:22:08 - 0:22:10::how do you want to go hook up?
0:22:10 - 0:22:12::And he was like, he literally went like this.
0:22:12 - 0:22:14::No thanks.
0:22:14 - 0:22:18::What did it shock me to know who this is?
0:22:18 - 0:22:19::No.
0:22:19 - 0:22:21::I think you are.
0:22:21 - 0:22:25::I don't think you'd be able to think of it but I think when you hear it you'd go,
0:22:25 - 0:22:27::that makes fucking perfect sense.
0:22:27 - 0:22:28::I'm fine.
0:22:28 - 0:22:29::That's crazy.
0:22:29 - 0:22:30::So that was jarring.
0:22:30 - 0:22:32::That was a jarring moment.
0:22:32 - 0:22:34::Well, sometimes grinding can be better than sex.
0:22:34 - 0:22:36::So in a way, you're telling me.
0:22:36 - 0:22:41::I think he just, he went to a sexual place that is.
0:22:41 - 0:22:43::Yeah, we're sexually gratifying than sex.
0:22:43 - 0:22:44::That's right.
0:22:44 - 0:22:48::Well, that's like, he basically did something almost like a chalk zone or like in the matrix type of shit.
0:22:48 - 0:22:52::Where it's like everyone around you is in different reality than you.
0:22:52 - 0:22:56::And he just decided like, I'm grinding lights on in a kitchen.
0:22:56 - 0:22:58::Everybody's standing around.
0:22:58 - 0:23:01::I'm grinding now.
0:23:01 - 0:23:03::Now let me say this.
0:23:03 - 0:23:06::So going on kind of similar way, you're out to Nate.
0:23:06 - 0:23:09::I was at a dance like an eighth grade dance.
0:23:09 - 0:23:13::And I'll say that I was hanging with the wrong crewman.
0:23:13 - 0:23:15::I don't fuck with these people anymore.
0:23:15 - 0:23:17::No, no, we never did drugs.
0:23:17 - 0:23:22::But they were doing something that I don't fuck with.
0:23:22 - 0:23:23::Squeezing.
0:23:23 - 0:23:26::I don't even want to say this.
0:23:26 - 0:23:28::Squeezing asses.
0:23:28 - 0:23:29::Good.
0:23:29 - 0:23:30::But you weren't doing that.
0:23:30 - 0:23:33::So what they would do is they would run through the dance floor.
0:23:33 - 0:23:35::And this is awful.
0:23:35 - 0:23:40::But they would go through run through the dance floor and squeeze somebody's ass.
0:23:40 - 0:23:41::Oh hell no.
0:23:41 - 0:23:44::And I wanted them to think I was cool.
0:23:44 - 0:23:49::So what I would do is I would just run.
0:23:49 - 0:23:52::And I wouldn't touch anybody.
0:23:52 - 0:23:58::So I would run just simply run like Naruto through the.
0:23:58 - 0:24:01::Through the club, the eighth grade club.
0:24:01 - 0:24:05::And then come back to my friends and say that I did.
0:24:05 - 0:24:06::And I didn't.
0:24:06 - 0:24:07::I didn't do it.
0:24:07 - 0:24:09::I didn't want to do it.
0:24:09 - 0:24:10::You're sweetheart, Jay.
0:24:10 - 0:24:13::What we knew you were a good one.
0:24:13 - 0:24:18::Well, that wasn't the point of the story because I did much worse, much worse than, you know,
0:24:18 - 0:24:19::I'm bad ass.
0:24:19 - 0:24:20::No rebel.
0:24:20 - 0:24:22::You know what video I'm reminded of?
0:24:22 - 0:24:26::You guys know that like that.
0:24:26 - 0:24:30::What's that song that turned down for what?
0:24:30 - 0:24:31::You know that video.
0:24:31 - 0:24:32::The video is real.
0:24:32 - 0:24:33::And the fail isn't it.
0:24:33 - 0:24:34::Yeah, it's right.
0:24:34 - 0:24:37::You know, talk about all those little kids.
0:24:38 - 0:24:39::Turned down for what?
0:24:39 - 0:24:40::And they go fucking nuts.
0:24:40 - 0:24:41::I never saw this.
0:24:41 - 0:24:42::Oh, yeah.
0:24:42 - 0:24:44::In like school.
0:24:44 - 0:24:47::It's like, yeah, it's like a Renaissance painting.
0:24:47 - 0:24:50::Like it's a modern day Renaissance painting.
0:24:50 - 0:24:53::It's like all these like 12 year olds.
0:24:53 - 0:24:54::Like the drop happens.
0:24:54 - 0:24:55::Five and a half.
0:24:55 - 0:24:57::And it turned down for the first time.
0:24:57 - 0:24:59::And then you know,
0:24:59 - 0:25:00::I never turned down for it.

0:25:00 - 0:25:06.360000::and these kids are like so fucking hopped up on like Sprite and
0:25:06.360000 - 0:25:13.340000::now. Everybody's kids. Everybody's like just going fucking crazy in
0:25:13.340000 - 0:25:17.380000::their own way. You can kind of zone in on like this kids doing this dance.
0:25:17.380000 - 0:25:23.380000::Like it's it's so beautiful. Do you think people were grinding before the
0:25:23.380000 - 0:25:28.720000::invention of instruments? So just to natural music birds chirping rocks, landslides,
0:25:28.720000 - 0:25:32.880000::mudslides, whatever. Oh, there's a mudslide. Let's get the mudslide grind on.
0:25:32.880000 - 0:25:37::Probably on accident. I'm like crazy. Oh caveman loins. You know what I'm saying?
0:25:37 - 0:25:41.440000::Probably. Of course they did send me back. They did.
0:25:41.440000 - 0:25:45.880000::Yeah. Grinding. How good you would sleep if you're a caveman? No blue light.
0:25:45.880000 - 0:25:52.320000::Oh wow. No. Well, but officially all natural. I really can't imagine because that is
0:25:52.320000 - 0:25:56.560000::what I wonder. How many were were cavemen ever tired or when they were tired?
0:25:56.560000 - 0:26:02.080000::Certainly. I'm sleeping now. Well, they were living to 30 but they were but
0:26:02.080000 - 0:26:06.680000::well, then that's great. They probably you die before you start getting chronic illness.
0:26:06.680000 - 0:26:09.160000::You know what I'm saying? That's what I'm saying. That's what that's what our
0:26:09.160000 - 0:26:13.960000::creators, I think, intended for us as short. We weren't meant to get to fucking
0:26:13.960000 - 0:26:18.560000::bad over staying. No, welcome. Yeah. This thing. The return is up. This is past due.
0:26:18.560000 - 0:26:25.040000::It's time to give it back. And there's a late fee, by the way, in in the after life.
0:26:25.600000 - 0:26:30.240000::How are many years you live beyond 30 when you get to heaven? You have to spend doing what?
0:26:32.240000 - 0:26:35.360000::Don't make me say man. Grinding with the less fortunate.
0:26:38.240000 - 0:26:41.360000::Let's be a charity with four people with the loser. Nays loser table.
0:26:43.680000 - 0:26:49.120000::Would you guys participate in a charity where you grind with less fortunate individuals?
0:26:49.120000 - 0:26:51.120000::Yeah.
0:26:51.120000 - 0:27:00.480000::L their like a nursing home where you have to pour elderly people. Is that what you're saying?
0:27:00.480000 - 0:27:04.960000::Yeah. And it's like a grind of thought and it's like do it for as long as possible.
0:27:04.960000 - 0:27:11.360000::And yeah, yeah, yeah, like a boat. Okay. Of course, that would be a caffeine pills to stay awake.
0:27:12.800000 - 0:27:17.920000::B12 shots at the ready with nurses. Ready. What songs are we playing? What songs?
0:27:19.440000 - 0:27:25.040000::Let's see. It's mostly what you do. What about your last song? You know your last meal?
0:27:26.480000 - 0:27:30.400000::My last song. Oh, you know, what was your last YouTube video? It was a very good new
0:27:30.400000 - 0:27:34.880000::friend. So that's my last song. Yeah, that's a retrospective song.
0:27:35.760000 - 0:27:42.480000::I was 17. Did I already sing this on the podcast? It was a very good year. Somehow,
0:27:42.480000 - 0:27:48.240000::I feel like you sing this like every podcast. It was a very good year for small town
0:27:48.240000 - 0:27:57.120000::girls and soft summer nights. You got his gaze. Perfect. We got it. I liked it like that.
0:27:59.600000 - 0:28:03.520000::You make him seem a bit angry. Who? Frank? Because there not been a Frank biopic.
0:28:04.320000 - 0:28:09.840000::They haven't found the right one. They're asked to play him. How curious. Well, how curious
0:28:10.080000 - 0:28:16.240000::when an actor just got some amazing representation. Oh, oh, oh,
0:28:16.240000 - 0:28:18.240000::just a
0:28:19.760000 - 0:28:27.040000::a fucking agent who is based in South America. Willing to shave. Willing to wax.
0:28:27.040000 - 0:28:34.560000::40 pounds within three weeks. Medically. Willing to get cheekbones or dream. I wouldn't need that.
0:28:35.520000 - 0:28:42::Okay, but it's the thought of being really. Do you guys think the popular kids like,
0:28:42 - 0:28:46.480000::can you imagine being popular? I know like, I guess what we're saying is like,
0:28:46.480000 - 0:28:50.800000::the popular kids end up usually being hella successful and they actually don't burn out and become
0:28:50.800000 - 0:28:57.360000::losers. It's like, but can you imagine feeling the power of being a popular kid in sixth seventh
0:28:57.360000 - 0:29:03.280000::grade? I guess you were Jack, weren't you? I don't think so, but maybe. I mean, it's an interesting
0:29:03.280000 - 0:29:08.080000::thing. The concept of a popular kid, isn't it? Did life feel amazing? Did it feel like it?
0:29:09.200000 - 0:29:14.880000::Life was a moisture for you getting ready to check or whatever. It was crazy, man. It was crazy.
0:29:14.880000 - 0:29:21.120000::It was honestly the pressure was so intense that I felt like I spent all of high school recoiling
0:29:21.760000 - 0:29:27.840000::from the what fucking wild ride that was. It took close to the sun. I was 12. Yeah. I basically was
0:29:27.840000 - 0:29:34.800000::third degree burned in my soul because I flew too high. And then I just had to deal with
0:29:35.840000 - 0:29:41.040000::because I was the best, pretty much the fucking best skateboarder ever when I was 12 and then
0:29:42 - 0:29:51.840000::it turns out I wasn't and I sucked. And that's pretty much that was that pretty much stayed that bad.
0:29:51.840000 - 0:30:00::So if you guys have kids and your kid ends up being the most hottest popular list, best.

0:30:00 - 0:30:04.960000::football player, whatever soccer player kid on the planet. Are you going to resent them in some way
0:30:04.960000 - 0:30:10.080000::for for being that kid or are you going to dapp it up and say like I knew I had it in me my blood
0:30:10.080000 - 0:30:19.520000::somewhere? I think it would be fun to make fun of the other kids and the other parents of the
0:30:19.520000 - 0:30:26.240000::loser kids. So I'll probably be pretty happy with them. You know the parents are fucking making fun
0:30:26.240000 - 0:30:30.320000::of the kids. We were probably last three were probably getting roasted by the parents.
0:30:30.320000 - 0:30:37.040000::I was saying there's no question. I scored a I what happened what was this? I wasn't paying
0:30:37.040000 - 0:30:41.040000::attention in a soccer game one time when I was what fucking two years old or something six or
0:30:41.040000 - 0:30:47.920000::something. Somebody kicks the ball to me. I don't see it. I'm looking off. Max me right on the
0:30:47.920000 - 0:30:55.440000::hip. Oh hell nah. Everybody's laughing. Oh what else one more. Here I am. I'm in what seventh grade
0:30:55.440000 - 0:31:01.360000::basketball recreational community basketball league. Everybody gets a little metal for the best
0:31:01.360000 - 0:31:09.200000::best whatever best shot scoring. I get the medal for best pass most creative pass most creative
0:31:09.200000 - 0:31:17.680000::pass. Oh god. And you don't even want to know how creative it was. I mean you know just imagine
0:31:17.680000 - 0:31:26.560000::what it would look like. So let's take it back to Christmas can we? Yeah this episode is called
0:31:26.560000 - 0:31:30.160000::the how do we get so off track. We're supposed to be talking about Christmas Christmas.
0:31:30.160000 - 0:31:36.480000::Christmas Christmas is about your inner child and we need clearly need to heal our inner children now
0:31:36.480000 - 0:31:42.880000::because they're causing us much pain. You know what I mean? Oh there it is the inner child.
0:31:43.840000 - 0:31:48.080000::Well, why does it make you look so sexy with that head on Jack? I just put on a Pikachu hat
0:31:49.120000 - 0:31:59.920000::because of your own trauma. I don't know why. So yeah. So Christmas time is here. It's time to spread

0:32:06 - 0:32:09.840000::I learned that and I played it last night for everybody like herself. Okay, sounds like you're
0:32:09.920000 - 0:32:17.040000::getting into the Christmas spirit like heavily. It's my last one. It's my last go around.
0:32:18.400000 - 0:32:24.720000::Eric is going 80s after this year. I'm treating it like it is based on my what I'm feeling
0:32:24.720000 - 0:32:31.840000::spiritually. Well, it's like Christmas movie that I should watch. A good Christmas movie. What
0:32:31.840000 - 0:32:37.920000::are you guys favorite one? I love them up. It's Christmas Carol. I could watch every fucking Christmas
0:32:37.920000 - 0:32:45.920000::Carol and never get tired. The emotional trajectory of that story. A grump turned into a soft,
0:32:45.920000 - 0:32:52.400000::sweet old man. Are you kidding me? Charles Dickens, you bastard. You did it from the 1800s.
0:32:53.680000 - 0:33:00::You had it like that back when the 1800s. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Mr. Dickens. I really liked Christmas.
0:33:00.960000 - 0:33:07.120000::Nate, you would play an amazing scrooge. Yeah. Oh my god. You're so right. Jack, you would play
0:33:07.120000 - 0:33:12.400000::an amazing Ghost of Christmas future. I did. I'm doing play an amazing tiny Tim.
0:33:17.920000 - 0:33:24::Who's tiny Tim? Oh, Jack, please don't say this like this to me. Who's tiny Tim? I have.
0:33:24 - 0:33:28.320000::Are you kidding my ass? Why don't you take a guess as to who tiny Tim is in the Christmas?
0:33:28.320000 - 0:33:33.280000::He is a little, if I had to guess he's a little tiny dude named Timothy who has no parents who
0:33:33.280000 - 0:33:41.040000::walks around London helping rich people clean the dirt off their feet. Am I right? He is a crippled boy.
0:33:44.800000 - 0:33:50.400000::A crew. What do you mean by that? What do you mean by that? He birthed a fact or an act of war. Listen,
0:33:50.400000 - 0:33:58.160000::listen, he is. Scrooge has an employee. Okay. What's his fucking name? Tim. Oh, what's his name?
0:33:58.160000 - 0:34:04.560000::Nate? I forget. Drew. God damn it. I'm forgetting the employee's name. Well, this employee works
0:34:04.560000 - 0:34:10.240000::nine day for Mr. Scrooge. Works till the works till the ink is out of the pen. There's just a one
0:34:10.240000 - 0:34:14.320000::little cold burning in the fire. He's all cold. We're going to coat trying to do taxes for
0:34:14.560000 - 0:34:21.040000::Ebenezer Scrooge. And he has a big family. And he has a little boy named Tiny Tim who has a bunk.
0:34:21.920000 - 0:34:26.160000::He's out of bad thing to say, a bunk leg busted. He has a busted leg so he walks around the cane.
0:34:27.280000 - 0:34:34.320000::And well, uh, whoa, Eric, can we talk about what you just said? You just, he has a
0:34:34.320000 - 0:34:40.720000::busted head that somebody has a limp and their legs fucked up. I'm trying to be canceled.
0:34:41.360000 - 0:34:48.240000::Type of anyways, going to that. But this isn't ring about Mary Christmas to what one at

0:34:54.320000 - 0:34:57.200000::I'm talking about Mary Christmas to one and all or something like that.
0:34:57.200000 - 0:34:59.920000::One of the Merry Christmas to all and to all of good night.

0:35:00 - 0:35:01::He says that.
0:35:02.100000 - 0:35:02.900000::Well, maybe that'll be.
0:35:02.900000 - 0:35:04.140000::And can I tell you guys a moment?
0:35:04.140000 - 0:35:06.620000::I saw this Christmas Carol play one time
0:35:07.620000 - 0:35:08.840000::with my auntie Carol.
0:35:08.840000 - 0:35:10.180000::She took me to see it in Seattle.
0:35:10.780000 - 0:35:12.260000::And it was in the round.
0:35:12.460000 - 0:35:12.780000::Okay.
0:35:12.780000 - 0:35:15.380000::So the theaters all around and it was happening in the middle.
0:35:15.680000 - 0:35:19.140000::Someone dropped their brightly colored ticket onto the floor.
0:35:19.740000 - 0:35:23.700000::And the actor playing Tiny Tim's dad put Tiny Tim on a shoulder,
0:35:24.340000 - 0:35:27.820000::found the ticket crumpled it up and gave it to him like a present.
0:35:28.220000 - 0:35:31.780000::That was my first time seeing improv rolling with the punches.
0:35:31.780000 - 0:35:34.460000::And I thought that was fucking sick.
0:35:34.460000 - 0:35:36.060000::How did he think of it that quick?
0:35:36.760000 - 0:35:38.540000::I don't even think I understand what you're saying.
0:35:38.940000 - 0:35:40.540000::The play was going on Jack.
0:35:40.540000 - 0:35:45.460000::Someone dropped a ticket, which is not supposed to be part of the play on to the stage.
0:35:45.860000 - 0:35:49.580000::The actor picks it up as if it's part of the world crumpled it up like a little thing
0:35:49.580000 - 0:35:52.860000::and gives it to Tiny Tim like a brother in play with.
0:35:54.100000 - 0:35:56.340000::That reminds me of such a fascinating story.
0:35:56.740000 - 0:35:57.420000::I'm serious.
0:35:58.140000 - 0:36:05.740000::I was doing a second city touring patch co Christmas residency in Naperville,
0:36:05.780000 - 0:36:07.340000::perhaps Illinois.
0:36:07.660000 - 0:36:08.260000::Beautiful.
0:36:08.380000 - 0:36:16.020000::And this was my first ever show with the second city out on the road.
0:36:16.980000 - 0:36:18.540000::And we were singing.
0:36:18.580000 - 0:36:19.940000::It was a Christmas show actually.
0:36:20.740000 - 0:36:25.180000::And we were singing the opening song, which was originally written by the cast.
0:36:25.420000 - 0:36:29.380000::It's the time of year where families gather near and the holidays are here.
0:36:30.260000 - 0:36:31.420000::Don't make me do the rest of it.
0:36:31.420000 - 0:36:32.820000::Do it. Please do one more line.
0:36:34.780000 - 0:36:35.300000::God.
0:36:35.980000 - 0:36:37.340000::Was that really how it started?
0:36:37.340000 - 0:36:37.860000::Oh, dude.
0:36:37.860000 - 0:36:43.340000::My eyes are watering thinking about how cringy this was and how much this show,
0:36:43.340000 - 0:36:46.060000::this truly I'm crying thinking about this.
0:36:46.460000 - 0:36:49.300000::This show may be bombed harder than any other.
0:36:50.820000 - 0:36:53.500000::We had to do it quite a few times.
0:36:53.620000 - 0:36:59.980000::And it wasn't like a big like not that not like big, probably 200 seat like 200 seat with 80 people in it.
0:37:00.300000 - 0:37:01.140000::Snap.
0:37:01.180000 - 0:37:01.900000::That's not good.
0:37:02.380000 - 0:37:03.260000::Not that cool.
0:37:04.380000 - 0:37:08.540000::But the very first fucking run of it for the whatever.
0:37:09.220000 - 0:37:10.020000::Yeah, the first show.
0:37:11.060000 - 0:37:12.060000::We sing that.
0:37:13.340000 - 0:37:20.300000::And there's a line that's like a joke about how your uncle's there and he brought his gun.
0:37:21.540000 - 0:37:22.540000::And that was me.
0:37:23.620000 - 0:37:29.420000::And then I pretend to like accidentally just charge the fire armor, whatever.
0:37:29.420000 - 0:37:30.740000::And there's a gunshot sound effect.
0:37:31.100000 - 0:37:32.580000::And then I like fall to the ground.
0:37:33.940000 - 0:37:35.980000::And as I'm like waving like, Hey, it's me.
0:37:36.660000 - 0:37:37.460000::Gun goes off.
0:37:37.620000 - 0:37:38.500000::I follow the ground.
0:37:39.940000 - 0:37:43.180000::And I guess I had a quarter in my pocket.
0:37:45.180000 - 0:37:50.780000::And the quarter fell out and it was like the music stops for this moment of like a pause.
0:37:51.220000 - 0:37:59.780000::And so I like picked it up and I just said and picked up the quarter and I held it up and just said, Oh, a quarter.
0:38:00.660000 - 0:38:01.900000::And then we went back into the song.
0:38:01.900000 - 0:38:03.260000::And nobody reacted.
0:38:03.260000 - 0:38:05.340000::No, no, no, no, no.
0:38:05.540000 - 0:38:07.940000::I just said it in character pretend like it was part of it.
0:38:08.460000 - 0:38:14.060000::Oh, what a humiliating thing that we we have tried to do with our lives.
0:38:14.060000 - 0:38:14.740000::You know what I mean?
0:38:14.740000 - 0:38:19.380000::Just like I just remember like like that song was like so fucking awful.
0:38:19.380000 - 0:38:22.020000::It was like a sad and cursed shout out to whoever wrote it.
0:38:22.260000 - 0:38:24.860000::But I can always contact this.
0:38:24.860000 - 0:38:28.620000::The Christmas sort of like at second city.
0:38:28.620000 - 0:38:37.220000::It was like one of their big, the big ways they would get money is caching in on holiday theater.
0:38:37.220000 - 0:38:40.740000::I guess theater attended attendees, whatever.
0:38:40.740000 - 0:38:42.860000::People that want to see a show during Christmas.
0:38:43.100000 - 0:38:47.540000::And they would put on these Christmas themed sketch comedy shows.
0:38:47.980000 - 0:38:49.420000::And they were like.
0:38:50.540000 - 0:38:56.860000::And so every year it would be like kind of a guaranteed like way to make some good money.
0:38:56.860000 - 0:39:02.660000::But you would be doing like eight shows a week in the suburbs of Chicago.
0:39:03.060000 - 0:39:04.220000::Doing a show every night.
0:39:04.220000 - 0:39:08.020000::So people yeah, like 100, 100 bucks barely.
0:39:08.700000 - 0:39:16.700000::And then so a lot of people I didn't didn't have to do this, but like people would like drive out every night to Aurora, Illinois.
0:39:17.100000 - 0:39:22.820000::And they would do the worst fucking sketch show of their life and then drive back that night.
0:39:22.820000 - 0:39:25.100000::And they would do that every night for like two months.
0:39:25.100000 - 0:39:26.300000::Good God.
0:39:27.860000 - 0:39:31.460000::And these sketches, by the way, it's not like an original sketch review.
0:39:31.460000 - 0:39:34.140000::Maybe there's like a couple of sketches in it that y'all came up with.
0:39:34.140000 - 0:39:40.020000::But it was I remember doing these archive materials with like whatever, with it, whatever.
0:39:40.020000 - 0:39:41.860000::But yeah, literally it was.
0:39:41.980000 - 0:39:46.380000::I remember this one sketch that must have been written in 1963.
0:39:46.380000 - 0:39:49.260000::Or something because they showed us the tape of the archive.
0:39:49.260000 - 0:39:54.140000::And it was like glitched out like impossible to see footage.
0:39:54.540000 - 0:40:00.020000::And it was these references that I didn't understand where their names were like, pro more than these.

0:40:00 - 0:40:01::You know what I'm saying?
0:40:01 - 0:40:04::Like, names that were like old, old,
0:40:04 - 0:40:06.080000::the references were so obvious,
0:40:06.080000 - 0:40:06.840000::but you just like,
0:40:06.840000 - 0:40:08.840000::it's stupid.
0:40:08.840000 - 0:40:10.440000::It's like, what you're mixing.
0:40:10.440000 - 0:40:11.440000::It was crazy.
0:40:11.440000 - 0:40:12.680000::It was time, man.
0:40:12.680000 - 0:40:14.020000::Amen.
0:40:14.020000 - 0:40:16.040000::No, even not even, they weren't people.
0:40:16.040000 - 0:40:17.560000::They were just names for people.
0:40:17.560000 - 0:40:19.560000::And even the names were like,
0:40:19.560000 - 0:40:21.040000::I wish I could think of a good one.
0:40:21.040000 - 0:40:22.560000::Theoculus, you know what I'm saying?
0:40:22.560000 - 0:40:24.680000::It was like a Greek, Greek,
0:40:24.680000 - 0:40:28.680000::like shit that you would joke about back in the 1960s.
0:40:28.680000 - 0:40:30.520000::Like, Greek, ancient Greek stories.
0:40:30.520000 - 0:40:31.360000::Right.
0:40:31.360000 - 0:40:32.200000::You guys get it.
0:40:32.200000 - 0:40:33.760000::Right.
0:40:33.760000 - 0:40:35.920000::So that was an experience.
0:40:35.920000 - 0:40:36.760000::I was.
0:40:36.760000 - 0:40:39.160000::I once did the Christmas version of this
0:40:39.160000 - 0:40:43.320000::was I had to live in Cincinnati, Ohio for three months.
0:40:43.320000 - 0:40:44.360000::I remember when you did this.
0:40:44.360000 - 0:40:45.880000::Almost.
0:40:45.880000 - 0:40:47.960000::And it was probably one of the most
0:40:47.960000 - 0:40:50.080000::depressed I've ever been in my entire life.
0:40:50.080000 - 0:40:53.600000::And every single night I had to do the worst holiday
0:40:53.600000 - 0:40:57.040000::sketch show that was sold out every fucking night.
0:40:57.040000 - 0:40:59.640000::And it was the first time I'd ever done,
0:40:59.640000 - 0:41:02.640000::like I had never done like theater before.
0:41:02.640000 - 0:41:06.600000::So it was like new to me to do like a run of shows
0:41:06.600000 - 0:41:09.640000::every night sort of thing, like the same show every night.
0:41:09.640000 - 0:41:10.160000::Yeah.
0:41:10.160000 - 0:41:13.960000::And I was like, this is like, I can imagine like
0:41:13.960000 - 0:41:16.440000::a more hellish scenario than this.
0:41:16.440000 - 0:41:18.560000::Like doing the most busted,
0:41:18.560000 - 0:41:20.360000::worst sketches of your life.
0:41:20.360000 - 0:41:23.360000::Every single night for three months straight.
0:41:24.360000 - 0:41:26.920000::Were you the one spitting candy canes out?
0:41:26.920000 - 0:41:27.720000::Who was spitting out?
0:41:27.720000 - 0:41:30.120000::Yes, I filmed every night.
0:41:30.120000 - 0:41:32.560000::I would film Charles Pettit.
0:41:32.560000 - 0:41:37.040000::He had to, he had to like crunch up, eat a bunch of candy canes
0:41:37.040000 - 0:41:37.880000::on stage.
0:41:37.880000 - 0:41:40.480000::And then the backstage I would, he had to like spit it out
0:41:40.480000 - 0:41:41.480000::into a trash bag.
0:41:41.480000 - 0:41:44.560000::And I was just like so bored thinking of anything to
0:41:44.560000 - 0:41:45.440000::liven up the night.
0:41:45.440000 - 0:41:49.800000::I would just film him like throwing up a candy cane into a
0:41:49.800000 - 0:41:51.520000::trash can every night.
0:41:51.600000 - 0:41:54.760000::And I put together a super cut of him just like spitting out
0:41:54.760000 - 0:41:59.200000::trash, candy canes into a trash can.
0:41:59.200000 - 0:42:04::Like there was probably like what, like 70 videos of him doing
0:42:04 - 0:42:04.520000::that.
0:42:04.520000 - 0:42:07.960000::So would these shows crush like with the, with the,
0:42:07.960000 - 0:42:11.200000::but when you got the last that you resent the laugh almost
0:42:11.200000 - 0:42:12.920000::where you're like, fuck this.
0:42:12.920000 - 0:42:17.920000::So it was like a, it was like I was so empty inside.
0:42:17.920000 - 0:42:21.440000::And I was just like getting, it's such a,
0:42:21.440000 - 0:42:26.640000::a crazy feeling to get to bring somebody so much joy, you know,
0:42:26.640000 - 0:42:30.160000::everyone's having such a great time and you're fucking killing it
0:42:30.160000 - 0:42:32.280000::with this fucking sketch that you've done over and over.
0:42:32.280000 - 0:42:36.320000::You know exactly where the laugh goes and that you're going to
0:42:36.320000 - 0:42:36.840000::get it.
0:42:36.840000 - 0:42:40.920000::And then you get the laugh and then you're just like this, it,
0:42:40.920000 - 0:42:42.640000::you just zone out all those.
0:42:42.640000 - 0:42:43.760000::But did you feel this?
0:42:43.760000 - 0:42:46.080000::Because I mean, I only did this stuff on the cruise ship.
0:42:46.080000 - 0:42:50.160000::But when we would do it and I resented it too, but if it didn't
0:42:50.160000 - 0:42:52::crush, I'd be like, what the fuck?
0:42:52 - 0:42:52.960000::Like, you know what I mean?
0:42:52.960000 - 0:42:56.120000::Like a little bit, what did you care at all?
0:42:56.120000 - 0:42:57::No, not at all.
0:42:57 - 0:42:59.280000::It was just like I went.
0:42:59.280000 - 0:43:05.080000::So I think there was one show that did really, really poorly.
0:43:05.080000 - 0:43:09.280000::And I think it was a all, like it was a Christmas theme show.
0:43:09.280000 - 0:43:11.720000::And I think there was like some sort of like Jewish
0:43:11.720000 - 0:43:17.880000::organization came in and it was like, I think they like didn't
0:43:17.880000 - 0:43:21.080000::really like, I think that was the show that didn't go
0:43:21.080000 - 0:43:22.080000::over well.
0:43:22.080000 - 0:43:24.320000::It was a Christmas show for all Jewish people.
0:43:24.320000 - 0:43:25.320000::Yeah, yeah.
0:43:25.320000 - 0:43:26.160000::Oops.
0:43:26.160000 - 0:43:30.120000::Dude, we did a, we did a touring show in Skokie, not that far
0:43:30.120000 - 0:43:31.200000::of a tour.
0:43:31.200000 - 0:43:33.480000::And it was for like a rabbi convention.
0:43:33.480000 - 0:43:35.480000::Have I brought this up on here before?
0:43:35.480000 - 0:43:36.720000::I don't know.
0:43:36.720000 - 0:43:37.480000::Yeah.
0:43:37.480000 - 0:43:41.800000::It was for, so we did a second city show for 200 rabbis
0:43:41.800000 - 0:43:43.960000::in a basement of a Marriott.
0:43:43.960000 - 0:43:45.200000::Oh, they were.
0:43:45.200000 - 0:43:49::The lights, no stage, no stage lighting, like just lights on,
0:43:49 - 0:43:55.080000::lights on, folded chairs, like temporary platform.
0:43:55.080000 - 0:43:56.440000::They were kind of rocking with it.
0:43:56.440000 - 0:43:57.880000::Oh, they were rocking with you guys.
0:43:57.880000 - 0:43:59.160000::They were kind of rocking with it.
0:43:59.160000 - 0:44:01.760000::But we did a Q&A afterwards.
0:44:01.760000 - 0:44:05.080000::Oh, by the way, I had the worst sunburn of my fucking life.
0:44:05.080000 - 0:44:07.520000::And I just remember having like wanting to throw up
0:44:07.520000 - 0:44:11.440000::because I was like having sun poisoning.
0:44:11.520000 - 0:44:15.160000::And the Q&A was going on for so fucking long
0:44:15.160000 - 0:44:17.800000::because Trump had just won.
0:44:17.800000 - 0:44:18.320000::Oh.
0:44:18.320000 - 0:44:19.840000::And so these rabbis were asking like,
0:44:19.840000 - 0:44:21.760000::what is the future of comedy?
0:44:21.760000 - 0:44:22.760000::Right.
0:44:22.760000 - 0:44:24.320000::What is going to happen now?
0:44:24.320000 - 0:44:27.080000::Because you know, they're all trying to like glean some,
0:44:27.080000 - 0:44:28.400000::they're being rabbis about it.
0:44:28.400000 - 0:44:29.600000::You know the vibes.
0:44:29.600000 - 0:44:31.480000::Well, how can I stretch this fucking bar mitzvah out
0:44:31.480000 - 0:44:32.360000::two and a half hours?
0:44:32.360000 - 0:44:35.800000::Please, man, just let it get, let it happen.
0:44:35.800000 - 0:44:37.720000::If you're a rabbi listening right now,
0:44:37.720000 - 0:44:40.120000::shorten these fucking bar imbiot mitzvahs, man.
0:44:40.120000 - 0:44:40.960000::I can't do it anymore.
0:44:41.240000 - 0:44:44.280000::If church was 15 minutes long, for real.
0:44:44.280000 - 0:44:47.320000::Oh, if it was a drive to church, I'd go to church.
0:44:47.320000 - 0:44:48.320000::I'd go to church.
0:44:48.320000 - 0:44:49.920000::If there was a drive through the hospital
0:44:49.920000 - 0:44:52.880000::and I, whatever religion it was, I would do that one.
0:44:52.880000 - 0:44:55.440000::If I had a car and I didn't, whatever.
0:44:55.440000 - 0:44:56.720000::We can make this happen.
0:44:58.160000 - 0:44:59::Goddamn.
0:44:59 - 0:45:01::Shout out to every religion man.

0:45:00 - 0:45:06.160000::I remember we did a New Year's Eve show on the cruise ship and a guy threw up all up.
0:45:06.160000 - 0:45:07.960000::He was in the front row looking fucked up.
0:45:07.960000 - 0:45:10.640000::He had a Santa Claus hat on.
0:45:10.640000 - 0:45:12.480000::He had one of them, but it was after Christmas.
0:45:12.480000 - 0:45:13.480000::You know what I'm saying?
0:45:13.480000 - 0:45:18.380000::But he still had the Santa hat on and he threw up all over the fucking front and it got
0:45:18.380000 - 0:45:21.800000::onto the stage a little bit and then we had to go back in the back while they cleaned
0:45:21.800000 - 0:45:22.800000::it up.
0:45:22.800000 - 0:45:26.600000::And I remember thinking like they clean these workers clean this shit up like lightning
0:45:26.600000 - 0:45:28.040000::fast in a way.
0:45:28.440000 - 0:45:29.480000::But you could still smell it.
0:45:29.480000 - 0:45:30.480000::That's the thing.
0:45:30.480000 - 0:45:31.480000::So you came back out.
0:45:31.480000 - 0:45:32.480000::It's all cleaned up.
0:45:32.480000 - 0:45:33.480000::It's all wet.
0:45:33.480000 - 0:45:36.560000::There's no one sitting there anymore, but it still smells like fucking bile.
0:45:36.560000 - 0:45:42.480000::And yeah, did you show a bond throwing up.
0:45:42.480000 - 0:45:46.080000::You know, you know what's funny is when somebody throws up and then somebody throws
0:45:46.080000 - 0:45:50.360000::up because the other person throws up that is a hilarious one of my favorite things.
0:45:50.360000 - 0:45:52.200000::Chain of events, isn't it?
0:45:52.200000 - 0:45:53.800000::It really is.
0:45:53.800000 - 0:45:54.800000::Are you all aware?
0:45:54.800000 - 0:46:01::I don't do free promo, but are you all aware of Steve O's new special?
0:46:01 - 0:46:02::No, I'm not.
0:46:02 - 0:46:03::I'm frankly, I'm not.
0:46:03 - 0:46:04::No fascinating.
0:46:04 - 0:46:07::Still reeling off of Matt Rift's new.
0:46:07 - 0:46:10.720000::Oh yeah, wait, wait, Nate, what's the review?
0:46:10.720000 - 0:46:11.720000::It's amazing.
0:46:11.720000 - 0:46:12.720000::It's incredible.
0:46:12.720000 - 0:46:13.720000::Everyone must watch.
0:46:13.720000 - 0:46:15.520000::We gotta get Matt Rift on him.
0:46:15.520000 - 0:46:17.360000::Joy tactics officially.
0:46:17.360000 - 0:46:20.960000::Joy tactics endorses Matt Rift's new special.
0:46:20.960000 - 0:46:22.960000::I don't know.
0:46:22.960000 - 0:46:26.800000::The only thing I've seen about that one is the domestic.
0:46:26.800000 - 0:46:27.800000::The domestic.
0:46:27.800000 - 0:46:29.800000::The top about all snap.
0:46:29.800000 - 0:46:31.040000::Wait, I rescind it.
0:46:31.040000 - 0:46:32.640000::I rescind it.
0:46:32.640000 - 0:46:33.640000::Did you?
0:46:33.640000 - 0:46:40.880000::Well, it's so clear that he is like trying to lean into that I feel like there is a version
0:46:40.880000 - 0:46:46.680000::of standups who want to like the toe of the line stand up.
0:46:46.680000 - 0:46:53.080000::And I feel like almost every big standup right now is like trying to toe the line and
0:46:53.080000 - 0:46:58.160000::then cross over the line a couple steps throughout the special.
0:46:58.160000 - 0:47:04.520000::Like how far can they they cross the line with their jokes and it's like and Matt Rift
0:47:04.520000 - 0:47:06.520000::is trying to do that.
0:47:06.520000 - 0:47:11.160000::Like he's like, I relate man, I try and do that shit.
0:47:11.160000 - 0:47:12.160000::He big.
0:47:13.160000 - 0:47:15.160000::I'm like that.
0:47:15.160000 - 0:47:18.600000::He's kind of like a Bob Sagget almost but he doesn't.
0:47:18.600000 - 0:47:19.760000::I don't know.
0:47:19.760000 - 0:47:21.240000::I have to watch especially get my full.
0:47:21.240000 - 0:47:24.520000::You guys know Bob Sagget about their new box full house started.
0:47:24.520000 - 0:47:26.120000::I'll just say that right now.
0:47:26.120000 - 0:47:27.960000::Does that make you feel old much?
0:47:27.960000 - 0:47:28.960000::Wow, really.
0:47:28.960000 - 0:47:29.960000::Wow, really.
0:47:29.960000 - 0:47:30.960000::That makes me feel young.
0:47:30.960000 - 0:47:32.480000::It makes me feel like I've aged well.
0:47:32.480000 - 0:47:37.240000::And by the way, when I went to the casino two nights ago, I had my ID to the security
0:47:37.240000 - 0:47:43.320000::person and they looked up and they said, that's not fair to age like that.
0:47:43.320000 - 0:47:44.320000::What does that mean?
0:47:44.320000 - 0:47:45.400000::It was a it was a chick.
0:47:45.400000 - 0:47:46.400000::They were saying I look.
0:47:46.400000 - 0:47:47.400000::Oh, yeah.
0:47:47.400000 - 0:47:52.080000::And they weren't just curating a good experience that I would want to go gamble and have
0:47:52.080000 - 0:47:53.080000::fun.
0:47:53.080000 - 0:47:56.040000::That's not fair to age like that.
0:47:56.040000 - 0:47:59.320000::Do you know the idea of a pit boss, Jack?
0:47:59.320000 - 0:48:00.320000::Of course.
0:48:00.320000 - 0:48:02.800000::What does a pit boss do?
0:48:02.800000 - 0:48:09.400000::A pit boss is the basically manager of all of the dealers on the floor who is supervising,
0:48:09.400000 - 0:48:16.720000::who is aiding in any technical issues or any matters of misdealings.
0:48:16.720000 - 0:48:18.920000::Do you want to be that Nate because the name sounds cool?
0:48:18.920000 - 0:48:24.400000::I can just sound like an sick to be a pit boss.
0:48:24.400000 - 0:48:25.400000::Pit boss.

0:54:52.320000 - 0:54:54.160000::I thought fanfare was like snacks.
0:54:54.320000 - 0:54:56.080000::Should we have fanfare out at the party?
0:54:56.880000 - 0:54:57.400000::Little fanfare.
0:54:57.400000 - 0:54:59.160000::I guess that does make sense as snack.

0:55:11.220000 - 0:55:12.220000::oh, I'll say,
0:55:14.660000 - 0:55:15.840000::going to the casino,
0:55:16.820000 - 0:55:18.500000::this was a joy.
0:55:18.500000 - 0:55:21.540000::My parents live about 15 minute drive
0:55:21.540000 - 0:55:26.540000::from the MGM casino in National Harbor, Maryland.
0:55:27.140000 - 0:55:30.980000::And what could be more joyous than going in
0:55:30.980000 - 0:55:32.980000::with a controlled amount of money,
0:55:32.980000 - 0:55:35.180000::which I'm not afraid to part ways with?

0:55:38.940000 - 0:55:40.820000::It was something respectable.
0:55:40.820000 - 0:55:42.780000::I think I took out $300,
0:55:42.780000 - 0:55:46.300000::and I said, if I fucking lose it, I fucking lose it.
0:55:46.300000 - 0:55:48.100000::I'm spending that much on the experience
0:55:48.100000 - 0:55:50.140000::of being in a casino.
0:55:50.140000 - 0:55:53.340000::But somehow that's not what fucking happened.
0:55:53.340000 - 0:55:55.500000::I go in, I see what we got over here,
0:55:55.500000 - 0:55:57.660000::$75 minimum, $75 minimum.
0:55:57.660000 - 0:55:59.260000::It's kind of like a boozy-ass casino.
0:55:59.260000 - 0:56:01.820000::$75 minimum, are you fucking kidding me?
0:56:01.820000 - 0:56:03.820000::For blackjack, per hand?
0:56:03.820000 - 0:56:06.380000::Yes, per hand, you're put in this.
0:56:06.380000 - 0:56:07.220000::Are you fucking kidding me?
0:56:07.220000 - 0:56:08.060000::No, I didn't do that.
0:56:08.060000 - 0:56:09.260000::So I went to the back of the casino,
0:56:09.260000 - 0:56:10.900000::I found a $25.
0:56:12.540000 - 0:56:14.100000::That still seems like a lot.
0:56:14.100000 - 0:56:16.060000::I like them $5 tables.
0:56:16.060000 - 0:56:16.900000::Yeah.
0:56:16.900000 - 0:56:19.940000::There was no $5 table at this whole casino.
0:56:19.940000 - 0:56:22.220000::Are there $2 tables anywhere?
0:56:22.220000 - 0:56:24.300000::I want to do a $2 table.
0:56:24.300000 - 0:56:26.780000::If there is, it's one of those machines.
0:56:26.780000 - 0:56:28.820000::And those are fucking rad.
0:56:28.820000 - 0:56:30.540000::I think back in the 50s, you could just put down
0:56:30.540000 - 0:56:32.220000::like a fucking pet or something.
0:56:32.220000 - 0:56:34.460000::You didn't even have to have money.
0:56:34.460000 - 0:56:38.780000::All right, so but basically that's a lie?
0:56:38.780000 - 0:56:40.740000::No, it's not a lie.
0:56:40.740000 - 0:56:42.140000::I don't think that's a lie.
0:56:42.140000 - 0:56:42.980000::But maybe it's a lie.
0:56:42.980000 - 0:56:45.940000::So walk us through the experience.
0:56:45.940000 - 0:56:48.620000::OK, so I sit down at the fucking table.
0:56:48.620000 - 0:56:50.180000::I think here we go.
0:56:50.180000 - 0:56:53.060000::I hand my $100 bills to the dealer, I say,
0:56:53.060000 - 0:56:55.220000::you're going to regret this fool.
0:56:55.220000 - 0:56:57.020000::And then they give me my chips.
0:56:57.020000 - 0:57:01.900000::And the person next to me is something's wrong with them.
0:57:01.900000 - 0:57:05.980000::I guess they were maybe blackout drunk or had a disease.
0:57:05.980000 - 0:57:09.180000::And they're saying, I don't know, I can't play with these guys.
0:57:09.180000 - 0:57:09.900000::I don't know them.
0:57:09.900000 - 0:57:10.780000::I can't play with them.
0:57:10.780000 - 0:57:11.500000::I don't know them.
0:57:11.500000 - 0:57:12.460000::I got to go.
0:57:12.460000 - 0:57:14.460000::And so he got up and he left.
0:57:14.460000 - 0:57:19.940000::And from that point on, we just were the hands were coming
0:57:19.940000 - 0:57:20.900000::crazy.
0:57:21.740000 - 0:57:22.820000::I'm down to $25.
0:57:22.820000 - 0:57:24.060000::I got $25 left.
0:57:24.060000 - 0:57:25.740000::I just gave her a hundred.
0:57:25.740000 - 0:57:26.660000::Boom, I'm down assigning.
