0:00:04 - 0:00:07::People turn, somebody turns off immediately. This is the first time.
0:00:07 - 0:00:10::This is the first time listening to a joke that dates everywhere.

0:00:30 - 0:00:36::We got the head gum producers and execs all sitting around a giant conference table.
0:00:36 - 0:00:39::What is cream?
0:00:39 - 0:00:41::Get the fuck out. Get the fuck out.
0:00:41 - 0:00:43::But really, what is cream?
0:00:43 - 0:00:48::Well, what is a cream versus what is cream?
0:00:48 - 0:00:53::Cream is a liquidist substance that I don't know.
0:00:53 - 0:00:55::Does it come have to come from something?
0:00:55 - 0:00:57::Or can the cream exist?
0:00:57 - 0:01:00::Let's start with shaving cream.
0:01:00 - 0:01:02::Don't you want to eat that shit?
0:01:02 - 0:01:05::Every time you squirt that shit out, don't you want to take a lick?
0:01:05 - 0:01:07::I've never used it.
0:01:07 - 0:01:08::Was that wrong?
0:01:08 - 0:01:09::Oh, dude.
0:01:09 - 0:01:14::When I used to be all clean shaving, which I will be bringing back.
0:01:14 - 0:01:16::Well, you still are downstairs.
0:01:16 - 0:01:18::You weren't here.
0:01:18 - 0:01:20::Oh, downstairs? Yeah, it's fucking...
0:01:20 - 0:01:22::I keep shit ingrown.
0:01:22 - 0:01:23::You know what I mean?
0:01:23 - 0:01:27::It's all every single follicle is ingrown.
0:01:27 - 0:01:30::I shave like the wrong way.
0:01:30 - 0:01:34::But where are you saying?
0:01:34 - 0:01:35::Oh, yeah, you got a crumb.
0:01:35 - 0:01:36::Don't know shaving cream, dude.
0:01:36 - 0:01:37::Oh, thanks, man.
0:01:37 - 0:01:38::Oh, but don't eat it.
0:01:38 - 0:01:42::Okay, shaving cream, sour cream.
0:01:42 - 0:01:44::Whipped cream.
0:01:44 - 0:01:45::Oh, yeah, whipped.
0:01:45 - 0:01:47::So it's not a liquid.
0:01:47 - 0:01:48::It's not a sauce.
0:01:48 - 0:01:49::It's not a spread.
0:01:50 - 0:01:51::Well, what about this?
0:01:51 - 0:01:53::The cream of the crop.
0:01:53 - 0:01:54::Oh, him?
0:01:54 - 0:01:56::Oh, he's the cream of the crop.
0:01:56 - 0:01:57::What's that mean?
0:01:57 - 0:02:00::Because if that's a cream in your crops, you might not want to pick them.
0:02:00 - 0:02:06::Well, unless your crop is milk, then it's a drink.
0:02:06 - 0:02:08::Right, right, right.
0:02:08 - 0:02:10::Well, I just want to say...
0:02:10 - 0:02:15::I just want to say both of you guys in my mind are cream of the crop.
0:02:15 - 0:02:17::Because I only hang out with people who are that.
0:02:18 - 0:02:19::You see what I'm saying?
0:02:19 - 0:02:21::Can I say something even more?
0:02:21 - 0:02:24::You guys are the cream and the crop.
0:02:24 - 0:02:25::Oh.
0:02:26 - 0:02:27::Wow.
0:02:27 - 0:02:28::Because we still got grass roots.
0:02:28 - 0:02:31::We will always be grass root, dude.
0:02:31 - 0:02:32::Yeah.
0:02:32 - 0:02:34::In that sense, so to speak.
0:02:34 - 0:02:37::I'm getting joy right away from this one.
0:02:37 - 0:02:39::Well, go ahead, go ahead.
0:02:39 - 0:02:43::I was just going to say, like, I'm interested in cream, of course.
0:02:43 - 0:02:47::But you know what I like more than...
0:02:47 - 0:02:55::I guess what I'm more interested in this topic is the descriptor of creamy.
0:02:55 - 0:02:57::Do you like it?
0:02:57 - 0:02:58::Creamy?
0:02:58 - 0:02:59::Of cool.
0:02:59 - 0:03:00::Oh, okay.
0:03:00 - 0:03:01::Interesting.
0:03:01 - 0:03:03::I wasn't going to go there, dude.
0:03:03 - 0:03:04::I was.
0:03:04 - 0:03:05::Creamy.
0:03:05 - 0:03:06::Look at Jaxpie.
0:03:06 - 0:03:08::Describing things as creamy?
0:03:08 - 0:03:11::Jack is in the fucking sick-year-old fucking...
0:03:12 - 0:03:15::I got the steven-hocking legs a little bit.
0:03:15 - 0:03:16::Yeah.
0:03:16 - 0:03:17::Where's the meat?
0:03:17 - 0:03:18::Well, he's passed on.
0:03:18 - 0:03:19::You can't roast him.
0:03:19 - 0:03:20::But he wasn't she.
0:03:20 - 0:03:21::I can't.
0:03:21 - 0:03:22::He was a cheater.
0:03:22 - 0:03:23::He cheated?
0:03:23 - 0:03:25::Yeah, bro.
0:03:25 - 0:03:27::He was imagining that.
0:03:27 - 0:03:28::No.
0:03:28 - 0:03:31::Not going, can I get it all creamy?
0:03:31 - 0:03:34::Can you cream on steven-hocking?
0:03:36 - 0:03:37::Alright.
0:03:37 - 0:03:38::Please say it.
0:03:38 - 0:03:40::You definitely could.
0:03:40 - 0:03:41::You definitely.
0:03:41 - 0:03:42::You like it, creamy?
0:03:42 - 0:03:44::Wait, you like it, creamy, right?
0:03:44 - 0:03:46::That's what you're...
0:03:46 - 0:03:50::You guys, sorry.
0:03:50 - 0:03:51::But pull it back.
0:03:51 - 0:03:52::Pull it back to Darryl.
0:03:52 - 0:03:54::Why is that so funny?
0:03:54 - 0:03:58::This is also a big dissection of big Darryl, which we've been...
0:03:58 - 0:04:03::We have been encouraged not to discuss by our many representatives.
0:04:03 - 0:04:04::Right.
0:04:04 - 0:04:05::They bring up the Darryl industry.
0:04:05 - 0:04:07::Well, well, well.
0:04:07 - 0:04:09::How are you going to silence us now that we...
0:04:09 - 0:04:10::Whatever.
0:04:10 - 0:04:11::Every...
0:04:11 - 0:04:12::It's more famous.
0:04:12 - 0:04:13::Yeah.
0:04:13 - 0:04:16::And it's cows versus the nut.
0:04:16 - 0:04:19::Because you look at what's happening with almond milk.
0:04:19 - 0:04:21::Oat milk.
0:04:21 - 0:04:22::Milk.
0:04:22 - 0:04:23::Cassie milk.
0:04:23 - 0:04:24::Cassie milk.
0:04:24 - 0:04:25::What's next?
0:04:25 - 0:04:26::Coconut milk.
0:04:26 - 0:04:27::Can milk, dude?
0:04:27 - 0:04:28::No, they got coconut milk.
0:04:28 - 0:04:30::They've had that for a minute.
0:04:30 - 0:04:31::Well, God made that.
0:04:31 - 0:04:35::And it's water and milk at the same time.
0:04:35 - 0:04:38::So there's a war going on between cow and nut.
0:04:39 - 0:04:41::Which side are you on?
0:04:41 - 0:04:43::Dude, well, based on...
0:04:43 - 0:04:44::Cows.
0:04:44 - 0:04:45::Cows.
0:04:45 - 0:04:46::Cows.
0:04:46 - 0:04:47::Well, based on couties.
0:04:47 - 0:04:49::Yeah, well, a certain type of cow could be so cute, by the way.
0:04:49 - 0:04:50::Oh.
0:04:50 - 0:04:53::I know we just talked about cows with Joe Perra, but...
0:04:53 - 0:04:57::So I don't want to get into the milking technicalities about it,
0:04:57 - 0:04:59::because we already kind of discussed that, but...
0:04:59 - 0:05:00::Yeah.

0:05:00 - 0:05:06.560000::I will say cuteness wise. Yes, certain cows got it going on like that. Oh my god. A cat name.
0:05:06.560000 - 0:05:11.280000::Oh, not cat. A cow named Molly walking up to you and needing a rub on the neck.
0:05:12.960000 - 0:05:15.920000::Gotcha, girl. Why do I feel like a cow?
0:05:17.360000 - 0:05:23.120000::Either. Why do I feel like a cow could really take a fucking hard smack?
0:05:23.120000 - 0:05:30.160000::Well, if you smacked it on the side, like, I feel like that wouldn't even do anything.
0:05:30.160000 - 0:05:35.360000::Like, they would just be interesting. Interesting. Well, but you can't speak there to lack in a cow,
0:05:35.360000 - 0:05:40.960000::right? No, I bet they like a big fat pad on the rear. But the side, they're just so chunky.
0:05:40.960000 - 0:05:45.840000::I feel like you get really just like giving a fucking. You don't have to be careful.
0:05:45.840000 - 0:05:50.640000::You're in the head. I think you mean on their rear, AKA their...
0:05:50.640000 - 0:05:56.800000::I'm saying like on the side, you mean on the rear, on the face, on the wrist, yeah, exactly.
0:05:56.800000 - 0:06:01.440000::Or on the back, even on the back. Just on that, that, that beefy part, you know.
0:06:01.440000 - 0:06:07.760000::Let me go. Why don't you? Because words matter. Why don't you say a big, hardy pat instead of a slap?
0:06:07.760000 - 0:06:11.600000::That word doesn't mean that. Because that's not what I meant. A slap means in the face.
0:06:11.600000 - 0:06:16.560000::A hardy pat. You know what a hardy pat is. Hey, good job. Do you mean, yes or you give it a
0:06:16.560000 - 0:06:20.560000::fucking T-ball player, dude? I'm talking about a wind up fucking...
0:06:21.920000 - 0:06:29.200000::smack. You mean I'm just making a stegosaurus like that? That beast could handle that.
0:06:30.080000 - 0:06:35.600000::That's what you meant. Like a crazy ass slap. I bet if it could take a nice slap,
0:06:36.320000 - 0:06:40.080000::I just think they like that it would probably feel good, you know, like it wouldn't even hurt.
0:06:40.080000 - 0:06:44.240000::Well, have you seen them release the gas from a cow? They literally pop up,
0:06:45.200000 - 0:06:51.040000::puncture hole in its side into one of its four stomachs. You know, they got four stomachs.
0:06:51.760000 - 0:06:57.040000::And you thought that was just me that had that many. Why do they have four? Is it for a cud?
0:06:57.040000 - 0:07:00.880000::They don't do that, do they? Oh, yeah. They cut out every night. Really?
0:07:02.080000 - 0:07:05.840000::Yeah. Okay. It's free kimchi.
0:07:09.280000 - 0:07:12.880000::We don't. We talk about they release gas. They like pump. Like it's like...
0:07:12.880000 - 0:07:16.240000::I'll send you a, I'll send you one of the disturbing videos. Well, religion is that.
0:07:16.240000 - 0:07:20.800000::Literally slice the cow open sometimes to release it. They like put an eagle in it.
0:07:22.080000 - 0:07:27.440000::And they release methane. We had to happen to somebody's ear. One of our friends' ears did that
0:07:27.440000 - 0:07:33.600000::recently. Not to say who. Yeah, it was Ruby. But that was for heat. That was to lower her body
0:07:33.600000 - 0:07:38.480000::temperature. Well, they slice the top of her ears off to release heat from her, which makes very
0:07:38.480000 - 0:07:44.160000::much sense to me. And look at what happened Trump to Trump. Notice how much more free he's looking
0:07:44.160000 - 0:07:47.520000::lately. Right. It's not sweaty. I just watched them play an amazing golf game.
0:07:49.120000 - 0:07:52.880000::The bastard piece of money club. How many club championships?
0:07:52.880000 - 0:07:57.200000::Oh, bro. They're countless at this point, buddy. But we don't rock with him. Don't get the
0:07:57.200000 - 0:08:01.200000::impression that we rock with him politically. Kamala would smoke him on my golf course.
0:08:01.920000 - 0:08:06.640000::I bet you weirdly, weirdly, I bet you Kamala could swing that thing like a helicopter.
0:08:06.640000 - 0:08:08.960000::Oh, I bet she can. You swine that thing.
0:08:22.640000 - 0:08:31.440000::Wow. No joke. That hit. It hit. It hit. That was involuntary.
0:08:31.440000 - 0:08:38::That was involuntary. What I just said. That's really good. I've no memory of saying that.
0:08:38 - 0:08:42.160000::I just like just come up. Yeah. What are you going to my registry?
0:08:42.160000 - 0:08:46.080000::Swine that thing. Come on. The candy swine that thing.
0:08:47.280000 - 0:08:54.560000::I know she can realistically not even joking. Oh my god. She. Wow. Oh, man.
0:08:55.360000 - 0:09:00.160000::She is the moment right now. Kamala is our future. Do not.
0:09:01.200000 - 0:09:04.720000::Right. Oh, I do love that. I do like it when I hear that.
0:09:04.720000 - 0:09:09.840000::Coco's. I'm like, I think in that same type of speaking pattern. That's very, I think us coded.
0:09:10.400000 - 0:09:16.160000::Yeah. What is this in a context? What did you? What did you use your father of a coconut tree?
0:09:16.160000 - 0:09:29.440000::She. Now this is I love this. The context. That's where the sentence ends. You exist in the context. Stop.
0:09:29.440000 - 0:09:40::Stop. Stop. Can you imagine if we were all politicians how much like raw clips they could make out of us looking like fucking idiots?
0:09:40 - 0:09:45.440000::Like it would be it would be like damn near endless like the amount from joy tactics.
0:09:47.440000 - 0:09:50.640000::This shit is hidden and if you look like a bucket or blow up no one.
0:09:51.520000 - 0:09:58.160000::This is a private sort of Mason like community. There's a reason why it stays this size.
0:09:58.160000 - 0:09:59.920000::It's plateaued.

0:10:00 - 0:10:02::It's followers
0:10:02.960000 - 0:10:04.960000::What
0:10:05.160000 - 0:10:10.400000::What we talk no one will ever see this. Oh, yeah, you know what I've repeatedly recently about politicians
0:10:11.400000 - 0:10:15.260000::Politicians yeah politics yeah, you mean Hollywood for ugly people
0:10:21.440000 - 0:10:25.640000::So who's mad gates oh in the real Hollywood who's that? Yeah
0:10:25.640000 - 0:10:27.640000::Mm-hmm
0:10:27.680000 - 0:10:29.680000::You bitch
0:10:31.200000 - 0:10:36.140000::Wow, you know, that's it's on my TV. He's an altitude based pet a pile
0:10:41 - 0:10:44.240000::Here's what do you guys see the clip of Gerald Ford?
0:10:45.320000 - 0:10:47.640000::Getting it down. Which one down on naked?
0:10:48.640000 - 0:10:56.600000::No, no, this was a some sort of press conference in the 70s and a child a
0:10:57.960000 - 0:10:59.960000::Little girl asked him
0:11:00.760000 - 0:11:10.280000::Will there ever be a female president and he said he said the first female president will not be elected on her own
0:11:10.960000 - 0:11:16.920000::It will be an older president that is stepping down or will likely die
0:11:17.640000 - 0:11:19.640000::And
0:11:19.640000 - 0:11:26.060000::Vice President will who is a female vice president will move up to become the president so in a way
0:11:26.240000 - 0:11:28.800000::What else did he predict Gerald Ford?
0:11:29.800000 - 0:11:34.120000::Thomas a sort of time travel for just quite
0:11:34.760000 - 0:11:39.200000::Curious and he invented the tea mobile and he was sassy
0:11:39.840000 - 0:11:45.280000::Oops Gerald Ford. Oh hell. Hello, Gerald come on in Gerald
0:11:45.920000 - 0:11:49.660000::Gerald I got your favorite cigars here. Why don't you come?
0:11:52.360000 - 0:11:54.360000::Morning Gerald
0:11:54.360000 - 0:11:56.360000::Gerald likes to get that oh
0:11:57.120000 - 0:12:00.520000::He likes it cream me he probably don't know you
0:12:02.200000 - 0:12:06.200000::No, no there is a line with presidents like there's always a line
0:12:07.200000 - 0:12:11.240000::Yeah, and it's like yeah, I draw that I draw that Gerald right there root off
0:12:12.240000 - 0:12:14.240000::Middle name Rudolph
0:12:16.080000 - 0:12:20.160000::What does he know that Ford what you think he was given the alien brief?
0:12:20.920000 - 0:12:27::Most definitely are you kidding me? Well, he died in Rancho Marrage, California
0:12:27.880000 - 0:12:29.880000::No coincidence isn't oh
0:12:30.240000 - 0:12:33.440000::He was a bit fugly with it frankly actually
0:12:34.480000 - 0:12:39.880000::Not fugly, but just for you look at him playing football. He looks like frickin David Hattelhoff
0:12:40.240000 - 0:12:46.800000::Well in his youth on land right I would say he's kind of like a forgotten president in a way

0:25:32.960000 - 0:25:35.120000::Cause you could go light medium, heavy with the dressing
0:25:35.120000 - 0:25:37.840000::and you put me on the heavy cream.
0:25:37.840000 - 0:25:41.240000::Heavy is, bro, and can I really quick tangent?

0:25:50.600000 - 0:25:53.600000::These people are going Gen X boomer style.
0:25:53.600000 - 0:25:55.680000::They don't care about the fucking design
0:25:55.680000 - 0:25:59.040000::or cute little farms that the lettuces are from.
0:25:59.200000 - 0:26:01.640000::These people care about making just a salad quick,
0:26:01.640000 - 0:26:04.480000::however you want it to your liking custom.

0:26:05.480000 - 0:26:06.480000::It's nothing else.
0:26:06.480000 - 0:26:08::It doesn't need to be anything else.
0:26:08 - 0:26:10.080000::It's just salad.
0:26:10.080000 - 0:26:11.480000::It's just salad, bro.

0:26:17.800000 - 0:26:18.920000::It's just salad.
0:26:18.920000 - 0:26:20.760000::It's just a name.
0:26:20.760000 - 0:26:22::It's just salad.
0:26:22 - 0:26:22.840000::That's it.
0:26:22.840000 - 0:26:25.800000::But the names of the bowls are like the Thai Buddha bowl.
0:26:25.800000 - 0:26:28.560000::The super green goddess thing.
0:26:28.560000 - 0:26:29.400000::What they should say.
0:26:29.400000 - 0:26:30.440000::They have infiltrators.
0:26:30.440000 - 0:26:31.440000::They have infiltrators.
0:26:31.440000 - 0:26:33.080000::They're apparently trying to make it a certain way.
0:26:33.080000 - 0:26:34.200000::We need to buy Jess salad.
0:26:34.200000 - 0:26:35.880000::Because it's a switcher too.
0:26:35.880000 - 0:26:37.760000::If we ever start making that type of money,
0:26:37.760000 - 0:26:38.720000::you know what I'm saying?
0:26:38.720000 - 0:26:41.600000::Mario Lopez type of dancing with the stars money.
0:26:41.600000 - 0:26:43.360000::We need to buy Jess salad.
0:26:43.360000 - 0:26:46.760000::And we need to re-change all these names so that it's like,
0:26:48.560000 - 0:26:49.640000::just Buffalo and let it.
0:26:49.640000 - 0:26:51.160000::You know what I'm saying?
0:26:51.160000 - 0:26:52.400000::Buffalo lettuce.
0:26:52.400000 - 0:26:53.200000::Buffalo lettuce.
0:26:53.200000 - 0:26:54.040000::Buffalo lettuce.
0:26:54.040000 - 0:26:54.840000::Yeah, exactly.
0:26:54.840000 - 0:26:55.840000::You guys know what I'm saying.
0:26:55.840000 - 0:26:56.680000::Dude.
0:26:57.680000 - 0:26:59.520000::While we're talking, I hate to, like,
0:26:59.520000 - 0:27:01.120000::we're going to go back to cream so quick.
0:27:01.120000 - 0:27:02.800000::So I pray that it's like on the edge of their seat
0:27:02.800000 - 0:27:06.040000::wondering when I'm going to go talk about my creaminess shit.
0:27:06.040000 - 0:27:07.160000::It's just wait a second.
0:27:07.160000 - 0:27:10.400000::But speaking of businesses, I was talking
0:27:10.400000 - 0:27:12.640000::to a mutual friend of ours.
0:27:12.640000 - 0:27:16.240000::And I was bringing up how fun it would be to go to a water park.
0:27:16.240000 - 0:27:21::However, the caliber of water parks that are out there right now
0:27:21 - 0:27:22.320000::are not up to my liking.
0:27:22.320000 - 0:27:24.400000::They're not up to my standard.
0:27:24.400000 - 0:27:25.840000::And what I was thinking was this,
0:27:25.920000 - 0:27:29.040000::there's never been a legit water park.
0:27:29.040000 - 0:27:30.840000::That's adults only.
0:27:30.840000 - 0:27:33.680000::It's made for high end clientele.
0:27:33.680000 - 0:27:35.200000::No children are allowed.
0:27:35.200000 - 0:27:36.760000::25 and up.
0:27:36.760000 - 0:27:37.680000::That's the vibe.
0:27:37.680000 - 0:27:38.960000::25 and up.
0:27:38.960000 - 0:27:41.080000::But the most craziest water slides,
0:27:41.080000 - 0:27:42.800000::it's all mine themed.
0:27:42.800000 - 0:27:47.800000::It's like literally the waterslides are made of super polished stone.
0:27:48.560000 - 0:27:49.400000::Okay.
0:27:49.400000 - 0:27:50.240000::Oh my God.
0:27:50.240000 - 0:27:51.320000::There's no plastic, none of that shit.
0:27:51.320000 - 0:27:54.200000::You're drinking sasrax, you're walking around.
0:27:54.200000 - 0:27:56.560000::Essentially a mine jungle environment.
0:27:56.560000 - 0:27:57.400000::Did that be mine?
0:27:57.400000 - 0:28:00.160000::I'm not trying to appropriate anything.
0:28:00.160000 - 0:28:05.160000::Just imagine a real water slide retreat for men and women
0:28:05.160000 - 0:28:09.480000::and whatever, whatever for everybody.
0:28:09.480000 - 0:28:14.040000::Imagine we create that has a dull water experience as well.
0:28:14.040000 - 0:28:16.320000::Adult sex.
0:28:16.320000 - 0:28:17.160000::It could be sex.
0:28:17.160000 - 0:28:20.120000::You know what the name of that place could be?
0:28:20.120000 - 0:28:21.520000::What?
0:28:21.520000 - 0:28:22.320000::Not a mind.
0:28:22.320000 - 0:28:23.160000::What?
0:28:23.160000 - 0:28:24.160000::Not a mind.
0:28:24.160000 - 0:28:26::How man, please.
0:28:26 - 0:28:30::I don't think I should.
0:28:30 - 0:28:31.840000::I was thinking like San Diego water slide,
0:28:31.840000 - 0:28:33.840000::fucking adventure park, some shit like that.
0:28:33.840000 - 0:28:35.640000::Yeah, I get the dull adventure park.
0:28:35.640000 - 0:28:38.360000::So I mean, so I'm like to say, yeah, that's good.
0:28:38.360000 - 0:28:40.840000::I guess I was thinking it could be like a trap.
0:28:40.840000 - 0:28:42.120000::Like, not in our mind.
0:28:44.120000 - 0:28:45.400000::I don't like that.
0:28:45.400000 - 0:28:48.960000::Well, but I just do want to say like I'm not getting a lot of buy-in
0:28:48.960000 - 0:28:49.880000::for me guys on this.
0:28:49.880000 - 0:28:51.320000::I'm not getting a lot of traction here.
0:28:51.320000 - 0:28:52.320000::Like an idea next.
0:28:52.320000 - 0:28:54.320000::Just move on.
0:28:54.320000 - 0:28:55.320000::Jesus fucking Christ.
0:28:55.320000 - 0:28:58.320000::An adult water slide, my un themed.
0:28:58.320000 - 0:29:00.320000::What are you fucking?
0:29:00.320000 - 0:29:01.320000::Jesus, no, Tiki.
0:29:01.320000 - 0:29:02.320000::It's a Tiki.
0:29:02.320000 - 0:29:03.320000::Oh, it was a Tiki.
0:29:03.320000 - 0:29:04.320000::Oh, bro, bro.
0:29:04.320000 - 0:29:08.320000::Not problematic Tiki themed water park.
0:29:08.320000 - 0:29:11.120000::Nate is the worst only one.
0:29:11.120000 - 0:29:12.120000::You better watch out.
0:29:12.120000 - 0:29:16.160000::If you are ever pitching to Nate, you better be ready.
0:29:16.160000 - 0:29:20.040000::I feel bad for anybody who's got to walk into that room that you're in
0:29:20.040000 - 0:29:21.040000::right now, Nate.
0:29:21.040000 - 0:29:23.360000::Start telling you I'm going to be drunk.
0:29:23.360000 - 0:29:26.040000::I'm going to be fucking not paying attention.
0:29:26.040000 - 0:29:29.240000::You're going to have to shake me to fucking get me to pay attention
0:29:29.240000 - 0:29:31.240000::to any way.
0:29:31.240000 - 0:29:36.040000::Just like doing like, doing constant lines of cocaine.
0:29:36.040000 - 0:29:40.040000::Like, never a never truly literally never had anyone.
0:29:40.040000 - 0:29:44.560000::You have an assistant like chopping up coke as you're going in like in a circle.
0:29:44.560000 - 0:29:45.560000::I would be facing it.
0:29:45.560000 - 0:29:49.520000::If I was on fucking Shark Tank, my chair would be facing away from them.
0:29:49.520000 - 0:29:52.320000::And then I'd keep on swiveling me back.
0:29:52.320000 - 0:29:54.920000::And then I'd keep pushing it back.
0:29:54.920000 - 0:29:55.920000::So it's like anime style.
0:29:55.920000 - 0:29:56.920000::The shot.
0:29:56.920000 - 0:29:59.760000::It's like a behind like over the shoulder like behind you.

0:30:00 - 0:30:04.340000::Yeah, yeah, yeah, they pitched the water park right now to the sharks.
0:30:04.340000 - 0:30:05.380000::They make it good.
0:30:05.380000 - 0:30:06.380000::A water park?
0:30:06.380000 - 0:30:07.380000::That is.
0:30:07.380000 - 0:30:08.380000::Pitch it.
0:30:08.380000 - 0:30:11.100000::Okay, so you did the adult one.
0:30:11.100000 - 0:30:16.880000::So this is a water park for babies just for little toddlers because water parks are for
0:30:16.880000 - 0:30:18.180000::kids, right?
0:30:18.180000 - 0:30:20.780000::You would never put a baby down a water slide would you?
0:30:20.780000 - 0:30:22.540000::That'd be dangerous.
0:30:22.540000 - 0:30:23.940000::Not a this one.
0:30:23.940000 - 0:30:25.980000::Babies only water slide.
0:30:25.980000 - 0:30:26.980000::Water park.
0:30:26.980000 - 0:30:27.980000::Can the shrimp go in?
0:30:27.980000 - 0:30:29.860000::Problematic anything about it.
0:30:29.860000 - 0:30:32.780000::There's no sort of other cultures involved.
0:30:32.780000 - 0:30:36.860000::It's just it's just your whites only.
0:30:36.860000 - 0:30:37.860000::Whoa.
0:30:37.860000 - 0:30:41.660000::No, no, no, no.
0:30:41.660000 - 0:30:45.860000::What do you know that's nothing to laugh at?
0:30:45.860000 - 0:30:51.020000::When you say babies only, you mean zero adults even supervising?
0:30:51.020000 - 0:30:52.420000::So this is a rug rat style.
0:30:52.420000 - 0:30:53.420000::The rug rat.
0:30:53.420000 - 0:30:55.700000::But you're filming them and you're making a reality show.
0:30:55.700000 - 0:30:56.700000::Of course.
0:30:56.700000 - 0:30:57.700000::Yeah.
0:30:57.700000 - 0:30:58.700000::Of course.
0:30:58.700000 - 0:31:01.340000::That can be and by the way, that's going to be an international hit because there's no
0:31:01.340000 - 0:31:02.340000::language.
0:31:02.340000 - 0:31:03.340000::What are we?
0:31:03.340000 - 0:31:04.620000::Yo, that's so smart.
0:31:04.620000 - 0:31:08.180000::I feel like making a reality show that's babies only.
0:31:08.180000 - 0:31:09.180000::Every language.
0:31:09.180000 - 0:31:10.180000::Every language.
0:31:10.180000 - 0:31:11.180000::Every language.
0:31:11.180000 - 0:31:12.180000::Genius.
0:31:12.180000 - 0:31:13.180000::Yep.
0:31:13.180000 - 0:31:15.420000::And that's what that's what everybody then that we're scared about now is.
0:31:15.420000 - 0:31:16.420000::Oh my God.
0:31:16.420000 - 0:31:17.420000::International AP.
0:31:17.420000 - 0:31:18.420000::Old.
0:31:18.420000 - 0:31:19.420000::Two year old.
0:31:19.420000 - 0:31:20.420000::One.

0:31:45.500000 - 0:31:50.020000::But New York gets she still gets to be in it.
0:31:50.020000 - 0:31:51.700000::Remember how I love New York?
0:31:51.700000 - 0:31:52.700000::Yeah.
0:31:52.700000 - 0:31:53.700000::Of course.
0:31:53.700000 - 0:31:54.700000::Of course.
0:31:54.700000 - 0:31:56.340000::Well, we brought up Tilo to kill on last one.
0:31:56.340000 - 0:31:57.340000::I don't know.
0:31:57.340000 - 0:32:01.260000::Any other hidden reality shows stars from the air that that were awesome.
0:32:01.260000 - 0:32:04.460000::Well, you know, they're bringing back this surreal life.
0:32:04.460000 - 0:32:05.460000::Remember that show?
0:32:05.460000 - 0:32:11.980000::Well, I know I deal with that show is it was like de-less celebrities all get together
0:32:11.980000 - 0:32:13.580000::in a house.
0:32:13.580000 - 0:32:16.060000::And I think like that was the episode.
0:32:16.060000 - 0:32:17.860000::I think I think Verne Troyer was on.
0:32:17.860000 - 0:32:18.860000::There's like some fuck.

0:42:21.640000 - 0:42:23.520000::Oprah and Gail King.
0:42:23.520000 - 0:42:27.680000::The headline is, we'd tell you if we were lesbian.
0:42:27.680000 - 0:42:30.680000::No.
0:42:30.680000 - 0:42:31.680000::All right.
0:42:31.680000 - 0:42:32.680000::Respect that.
0:42:32.680000 - 0:42:34.280000::Respect that from now.
0:42:34.280000 - 0:42:35.120000::Yeah.
0:42:35.120000 - 0:42:36.320000::Next.
0:42:36.320000 - 0:42:38.680000::Next, let's see here.
0:42:38.680000 - 0:42:42.320000::Selen Dion, performing in large venues is risky.
0:42:42.320000 - 0:42:48.640000::Loud noises, not good for stiff person syndrome.
0:42:48.640000 - 0:42:51.840000::Oh, so what is stiff person syndrome?
0:42:51.840000 - 0:42:53.320000::You know, tread lightly.
0:42:53.320000 - 0:42:54.840000::Tread very lightly here.
0:42:54.840000 - 0:42:55.840000::OK.
0:42:55.840000 - 0:42:58.120000::No one is making fun of this.
0:42:58.120000 - 0:43:00.400000::She, OK, what is this?
0:43:00.400000 - 0:43:02.560000::Oh, is this her condition?
0:43:02.560000 - 0:43:03.560000::This is her condition.
0:43:03.560000 - 0:43:05.560000::Yes, it'll be a tread very lightly.
0:43:05.560000 - 0:43:07.840000::She becomes locked into her body for real.
0:43:07.840000 - 0:43:10::And you know what triggers it?
0:43:10 - 0:43:11::No.
0:43:11 - 0:43:14.640000::Our moments of stress and moments of joy.
0:43:14.640000 - 0:43:17::And guess what gives her more joy than any?
0:43:17 - 0:43:20.960000::What do you think gives Selen Dion the most joy in her life?
0:43:20.960000 - 0:43:22.880000::Singing.
0:43:22.880000 - 0:43:23.880000::It's singing, dude.
0:43:23.880000 - 0:43:28::So when she hits those high highs, that's where it starts to lock in.
0:43:28 - 0:43:28.760000::Oh, my God.
0:43:28.760000 - 0:43:31.400000::So it's basically a beautiful movie waiting to happen.
0:43:31.400000 - 0:43:34.600000::It's a devil's curse that she's experiencing.
0:43:34.600000 - 0:43:35.200000::And I feel for it.
0:43:35.200000 - 0:43:36::Right.
0:43:36 - 0:43:37.600000::Badly.
0:43:37.600000 - 0:43:38.440000::Good, quite badly for her.
0:43:38.440000 - 0:43:39.200000::That's horrible.
0:43:42.200000 - 0:43:43.960000::What's the next headline, Nate?
0:43:43.960000 - 0:43:46.720000::There's a lot of darkness on TMZL.
0:43:46.720000 - 0:43:49.520000::I'll say this.
0:43:49.520000 - 0:43:51.480000::So Tom Brady, he's single.
0:43:51.480000 - 0:44:00.760000::He's not dating a sports illustrated model as we may have thought.
0:44:00.760000 - 0:44:03.760000::So we can put those rumors aside right now.
0:44:03.760000 - 0:44:04.280000::Good.
0:44:04.280000 - 0:44:05.120000::Oh, and I'm reminded of.
0:44:05.120000 - 0:44:05.960000::He's the first to sound as work.
0:44:05.960000 - 0:44:07.240000::He's the give back my work.
0:44:07.240000 - 0:44:09::Michael Rubin's white party.
0:44:09 - 0:44:09.720000::Do you remember this?
0:44:09.720000 - 0:44:10.840000::We didn't get the invite.
0:44:10.840000 - 0:44:12.240000::You're dressed in.
0:44:15.240000 - 0:44:17.840000::We are going to go to the white party at some point.
0:44:17.840000 - 0:44:18.640000::Of course.
0:44:18.640000 - 0:44:20.760000::You know what I'm saying?
0:44:20.760000 - 0:44:27.360000::And we're going to have an amazing time.
0:44:27.360000 - 0:44:30.760000::I'm googling something very fascinating.
0:44:30.760000 - 0:44:33.480000::So this is the part of the episode where we're just all
0:44:33.480000 - 0:44:34::in the light.
0:44:34 - 0:44:36.440000::We're just going to be like surfing online for a little bit.
0:44:36.440000 - 0:44:39.280000::Maybe talking, but we're just kind of.
0:44:39.280000 - 0:44:40.200000::Oh, you are.
0:44:40.200000 - 0:44:42.480000::Our attention spans are just like your guys, dude.
0:44:42.480000 - 0:44:44.640000::We can't fucking podcast for a full hour.
0:44:44.640000 - 0:44:45.240000::You can't be.
0:44:45.240000 - 0:44:45.720000::We need that.
0:44:45.720000 - 0:44:46.240000::For an hour.
0:44:46.240000 - 0:44:47.080000::We need that.
0:44:47.080000 - 0:44:48.720000::Dude, I need to get online, man.
0:44:48.720000 - 0:44:50.360000::I can't fucking talk.
0:44:50.360000 - 0:44:51.480000::This sucks, man.
0:44:51.480000 - 0:44:53.040000::I got to get online.
0:44:56.520000 - 0:44:59.360000::That was a great point.
0:44:59.360000 - 0:45:00.280000::But I'm not just.

0:45:00 - 0:45:02.560000::online, I'm actually on a scientific medical journal.
0:45:02.560000 - 0:45:06.040000::The Milwaukee Journal, so this is the J-Store.
0:45:06.040000 - 0:45:08.760000::I'm on, well it's top secret, I can't,
0:45:08.760000 - 0:45:10.080000::I'm not gonna leak what website this is,
0:45:10.080000 - 0:45:13::but inspired by Doritos as a child,
0:45:13 - 0:45:18::a UW, that sounds stands for University of Wisconsin,
0:45:18.460000 - 0:45:21.920000::Madison, a scientist, cracked the secret
0:45:21.920000 - 0:45:24.880000::of no melt ice cream.
0:45:25.840000 - 0:45:26.680000::Okay.
0:45:26.680000 - 0:45:27.960000::Say what?
0:45:27.960000 - 0:45:29.880000::They cracked the secret.
0:45:29.880000 - 0:45:32.160000::You, it's a secret, why would they tell you?
0:45:32.160000 - 0:45:33::Then it wouldn't be cracked.
0:45:33 - 0:45:34.440000::You mean dip in dots?
0:45:36 - 0:45:38::No, those melt very quickly.
0:45:39.040000 - 0:45:40.360000::I actually can't even click through
0:45:40.360000 - 0:45:43.480000::the article because there's a paywall.
0:45:43.480000 - 0:45:45::Dang.
0:45:45 - 0:45:45.840000::Are you serious?
0:45:45.840000 - 0:45:47.720000::Shame on the Milwaukee thing.
0:45:48.880000 - 0:45:49.640000::Shame.
0:45:49.640000 - 0:45:53.760000::Wait, speaking of dip in dots, bringing it back to cream,
0:45:53.760000 - 0:45:56.400000::that is probably one of the most ingenious.
0:45:57.400000 - 0:46:01.160000::You know we know the forms of cream.
0:46:01.160000 - 0:46:04.320000::Daughter of the dip in dot in innovator.

0:46:48.480000 - 0:46:53.480000::in a house together and just podcasting once a week?

0:46:59.240000 - 0:47:02.480000::I'm like, it just really hard to make up with storylines.
0:47:02.480000 - 0:47:05.400000::And it's like, it's really boring.
0:47:06.920000 - 0:47:08.720000::Do you get paid?
0:47:08.720000 - 0:47:09.720000::Is it free food?
0:47:10.920000 - 0:47:12.280000::Then yeah, do it.

0:47:34.560000 - 0:47:37.680000::Because whenever we meet up, we're like together for,
0:47:37.680000 - 0:47:40.800000::we're kind of for a week, seven days.
0:47:40.800000 - 0:47:42.600000::That's like seven days.

0:47:54.080000 - 0:47:55.520000::We're going to be a little lucky.

0:48:24.080000 - 0:48:25.920000::I'll just put that way.
0:48:25.920000 - 0:48:26.920000::That's what you think you have.
0:48:26.920000 - 0:48:28.160000::I remember tried the gelato

0:49:39.480000 - 0:49:41.880000::and you're just listening to joy tactics.
0:49:41.880000 - 0:49:43.040000::Well, I'm doing that job.
0:49:43.040000 - 0:49:44.280000::Wondering what America's like.
0:49:44.280000 - 0:49:45.520000::Wow, these guys.

0:50:00 - 0:50:02.580000::You should get a fucking green card.
0:50:02.580000 - 0:50:03.860000::There should be like, you know.
0:50:03.860000 - 0:50:07.920000::Like, because I think our parents listen to this
0:50:07.920000 - 0:50:10.360000::and have no idea what we're talking about.
0:50:10.360000 - 0:50:12.880000::Native speakers can't even, that's why it's so advanced.
0:50:12.880000 - 0:50:16::Well, we're so new, what you would call the new ones.
0:50:17 - 0:50:18::Yes, I love that one.
0:50:18 - 0:50:19::New arms, really.
0:50:19 - 0:50:20::One of my favorite words.
0:50:20 - 0:50:21.880000::I've been learning so many words lately.
0:50:21.880000 - 0:50:22.880000::It's amazing.
0:50:24 - 0:50:24.760000::Jubilant.
0:50:24.760000 - 0:50:28.120000::I was, I was at a food truck this morning.
0:50:28.120000 - 0:50:28.960000::Yeah.
0:50:28.960000 - 0:50:31.680000::I was at a food truck and the guy inside
0:50:31.680000 - 0:50:34.560000::was getting cooked by the heat.
0:50:34.560000 - 0:50:36.960000::And I was like, if I'm ever in a food truck,
0:50:36.960000 - 0:50:38.920000::that's going to be, this sweat, like,
0:50:38.920000 - 0:50:40.640000::I've never seen a guy so sweaty,
0:50:40.640000 - 0:50:42.200000::but I still got a break for sandwich.
0:50:44.240000 - 0:50:45.080000::Imagine that.
0:50:46.400000 - 0:50:49.440000::Did you think that there's going to be sweat in your chicken?
0:50:49.440000 - 0:50:50.760000::Sweat chicken.
0:50:50.760000 - 0:50:52.840000::That is a chicken.
0:50:52.840000 - 0:50:54.720000::Sweat chicken?
0:50:54.720000 - 0:50:56.400000::Yeah, I didn't even think about it.
0:50:57.400000 - 0:50:59.720000::It's crazy that chicken can be creamy.
0:50:59.720000 - 0:51:00.960000::I'll just put it that way.
0:51:00.960000 - 0:51:03.160000::I mean, chicken, chicken, chicken,
0:51:03.160000 - 0:51:05.960000::chicken, you can make that shit creamy.
0:51:05.960000 - 0:51:07.920000::It's interesting when different animals,
0:51:07.920000 - 0:51:10.200000::products come together into a dish.
0:51:10.200000 - 0:51:11.560000::How interesting.
0:51:11.560000 - 0:51:12.760000::Right, right.
0:51:12.760000 - 0:51:15.640000::And in cream, with cream being the bonding thing
0:51:15.640000 - 0:51:18.440000::that bonds us all, everything has cream
0:51:18.440000 - 0:51:20.800000::and everything has cream in the middle of it.
0:51:20.800000 - 0:51:22.840000::Blood is the cream inside of a human.
0:51:22.840000 - 0:51:24.040000::Don't be so scared.
0:51:24.040000 - 0:51:25.640000::You know what I'm saying?
0:51:26.560000 - 0:51:27.840000::Cream is naturally free.
0:51:27.840000 - 0:51:28.680000::Just cream everywhere.
0:51:28.680000 - 0:51:29.520000::Just chill.

0:52:07.680000 - 0:52:08.520000::It's coming.
0:52:11.040000 - 0:52:12.240000::It's really close.
0:52:14.560000 - 0:52:15.880000::Congealed.
0:52:17.800000 - 0:52:18.440000::What's the R?
0:52:18.440000 - 0:52:19.600000::Congealed.
0:52:19.600000 - 0:52:21.080000::Real.
0:52:21.080000 - 0:52:21.840000::You know what I'm saying?
0:52:21.840000 - 0:52:22.680000::Congealed.
0:52:23.480000 - 0:52:24.320000::R. E.
0:52:24.320000 - 0:52:26.960000::There are already this is nothing.
0:52:26.960000 - 0:52:29.280000::No, because this is what cream.
0:52:29.280000 - 0:52:30.800000::It's going nowhere.
0:52:30.800000 - 0:52:31.640000::Congealed.
0:52:31.640000 - 0:52:33.760000::Already there's nothing in the R.
0:52:33.760000 - 0:52:39.960000::No, but then it's emulsified, activated molecules.
0:52:39.960000 - 0:52:41::See?
0:52:41 - 0:52:41.840000::Wow.
0:52:41.840000 - 0:52:42.680000::And emulsified.

0:52:43.680000 - 0:52:44.680000::Emulsified.
0:52:44.680000 - 0:52:45.960000::Yeah, that's what I meant to say.
0:52:45.960000 - 0:52:47.480000::Because this is just true.
0:52:47.480000 - 0:52:48.480000::The R is a mystery.
0:52:48.480000 - 0:52:51.400000::The scientists haven't discovered what R stands for yet.
0:52:51.400000 - 0:52:53.280000::Every letter stands for something.
0:52:53.280000 - 0:52:54.280000::Deep down.
0:52:54.280000 - 0:52:55.280000::Mm-hmm.

0:53:06.280000 - 0:53:07.280000::Whales have an alphabet.
0:53:07.280000 - 0:53:08.280000::You found that out?
0:53:08.280000 - 0:53:10.280000::Yeah, Nate, I know that shock.
0:53:10.280000 - 0:53:11.280000::See?
0:53:11.280000 - 0:53:12.280000::You hate whales.
0:53:12.280000 - 0:53:14.280000::You think they're dumb.

0:53:20.280000 - 0:53:21.280000::Oh my God.
0:53:21.280000 - 0:53:22.280000::A whale could take a round.
0:53:22.280000 - 0:53:23.280000::A whale could take a smack.
0:53:23.280000 - 0:53:24.280000::What did this happen to you, man?
0:53:24.280000 - 0:53:25.280000::There's a whale no cream.
0:53:25.280000 - 0:53:26.280000::Okay, Jack, what'd you say?
0:53:26.280000 - 0:53:29.280000::I said a whale could take a smack from what we had for.
0:53:29.280000 - 0:53:33.280000::I, I, we gotta call it guys.
0:53:33.280000 - 0:53:37.680000::What, I mean, I need to know what gave you guys joy.
0:53:37.680000 - 0:53:47.700000::Nate, I know it was that creamy fucking Chipotle bowl.

0:54:07.880000 - 0:54:11.360000::I'm immediately forget that that was ever even there.
0:54:11.360000 - 0:54:14.760000::And I turned that corner to go to the CTA,
0:54:14.760000 - 0:54:19.760000::to get my, and I'm, oh, now this is an amazing
0:54:19.760000 - 0:54:24.760000::architectural marvel of airports in America is this wall.

0:54:31.200000 - 0:54:32.760000::And I said, you know what, maybe,
0:54:32.760000 - 0:54:37.760000::maybe this will beat out my current background,
0:54:38.560000 - 0:54:40.280000::which I'll show to you guys right now,
0:54:41.840000 - 0:54:43.360000::is, and it's been there for a while.

0:54:47.920000 - 0:54:50.640000::Speaking of, we mentioned American Idol,
0:54:50.640000 - 0:54:52.640000::of course, earlier on this episode,
0:54:52.640000 - 0:54:55.280000::but I took that picture of them when I saw the live
0:54:57.600000 - 0:54:59.280000::when I was in high school.
0:54:59.280000 - 0:55:00.280000::And that was,

0:55:00 - 0:55:02.880000::But I was like, man, taking pictures of it,
0:55:02.880000 - 0:55:04.920000::maybe this will be my phone background.
0:55:04.920000 - 0:55:07.720000::Because I was like this wall so much.
0:55:07.720000 - 0:55:08.560000::Wow.
0:55:08.560000 - 0:55:10.400000::You know what that wall makes me think of?
0:55:10.400000 - 0:55:12.800000::Can't do that to you.
0:55:12.800000 - 0:55:14.720000::Well, the wall is so evocative.
0:55:14.720000 - 0:55:18.560000::If no one's ever seen this before, look that shit up.
0:55:18.560000 - 0:55:20.440000::That little, you're talking about the underground part.

0:55:27.440000 - 0:55:30.480000::I imagine being like a dad and coming home

0:56:21.840000 - 0:56:22.360000::Right.
0:56:22.360000 - 0:56:23.800000::Right before it all crumbles.
0:56:23.800000 - 0:56:24.400000::Play a mansion.
0:56:24.400000 - 0:56:25.520000::Right before your eyes.
0:56:25.520000 - 0:56:26.960000::Yeah, right.
0:56:26.960000 - 0:56:30.280000::I'm not going to be a manager because you're a wild.
0:56:30.280000 - 0:56:33.320000::Well, what gave your fucking asses, Joy?
0:56:33.320000 - 0:56:36.280000::Well, let me try one.
0:56:36.280000 - 0:56:42.640000::I'll say what gave me joy is a stranger.
0:56:42.640000 - 0:56:46.600000::Let's just say today I had a nightmare day
0:56:46.600000 - 0:56:50.080000::at the airport, which involved a level of cardio
0:56:50.080000 - 0:56:53.360000::that I have not done in my entire life.
0:56:53.360000 - 0:56:54.920000::That most people would have just their heart
0:56:54.920000 - 0:56:59.280000::would have exploded on the spot, frankly.
0:56:59.280000 - 0:57:02.480000::And I handled it very well.
0:57:02.480000 - 0:57:03.960000::I got to the gate.
0:57:03.960000 - 0:57:06.640000::And I did not have panic attack.
0:57:06.640000 - 0:57:09.640000::And I was not pouring water on my head in front of everybody.
0:57:09.640000 - 0:57:11.600000::But guess what?
0:57:11.600000 - 0:57:15.160000::Well, gave me joy is I sit down on the airplane.
0:57:15.160000 - 0:57:20.800000::And I was sitting next to a man who, wow, he was so normal.
0:57:20.800000 - 0:57:24.320000::Some people just, they're so normal.
0:57:24.320000 - 0:57:32.640000::Their skin is so wonderfully normal and they're close, good.
0:57:32.640000 - 0:57:36.440000::And they're just hanging out, not a thought in their head,
0:57:36.440000 - 0:57:41.040000::just the most NPC in the world, in the comfort that I got.
0:57:41.040000 - 0:57:46.440000::Just a little just sitting next to him
0:57:46.440000 - 0:57:50.840000::and trying to catch my breath for the entire three-hour flight.
0:57:50.840000 - 0:57:51.960000::Did he talk to you?
0:57:51.960000 - 0:57:55.560000::He said, are you a little hungover?
0:57:55.560000 - 0:58:00.360000::I said, no, I'm pathetically tired from how hard I just ran.
0:58:00.360000 - 0:58:01.160000::What did he say?
0:58:01.160000 - 0:58:02.080000::He giggled.
0:58:02.080000 - 0:58:05.200000::He said, oh.
0:58:05.200000 - 0:58:07.360000::And then he logged into Slack.
0:58:07.360000 - 0:58:08.200000::And he got his work done.
0:58:11.200000 - 0:58:11.800000::Slack.
0:58:11.800000 - 0:58:13.880000::Remember that?
0:58:13.880000 - 0:58:14.800000::Slack.
0:58:14.800000 - 0:58:16.400000::That's amazing.
0:58:16.400000 - 0:58:20.040000::So Eric, did you say what gave you joy?
0:58:20.040000 - 0:58:21.040000::That's a great idea.
0:58:21.040000 - 0:58:21.880000::Wow.
0:58:21.880000 - 0:58:23.440000::No, dude, I can't wait.
0:58:23.440000 - 0:58:29.520000::So here's, I have been having to get up early for my job.
0:58:29.520000 - 0:58:35.400000::And usually I would dread that, but the mornings have been
0:58:35.400000 - 0:58:36.920000::very nice for me.
0:58:36.920000 - 0:58:37.640000::And here's what I do.
0:58:37.640000 - 0:58:38.920000::It's sort of pathetic.
0:58:38.920000 - 0:58:43.520000::It's very, I would say like millennial.
0:58:43.520000 - 0:58:45.960000::But I've been buying all these liquid deaths.
0:58:45.960000 - 0:58:46.960000::Right.
0:58:46.960000 - 0:58:48.480000::It's pathetic.
0:58:48.480000 - 0:58:51.760000::These ice still, not sparkling, still.
0:58:51.760000 - 0:58:54.640000::And I get the liquid a shower.
0:58:54.640000 - 0:58:55.680000::I get the liquid death.
0:58:55.680000 - 0:58:59.280000::I'm drinking an ice cold can of water driving
0:58:59.280000 - 0:59:03.760000::through beautiful Los Angeles in the mornings to work.
0:59:03.760000 - 0:59:05.880000::And I'm playing.
0:59:05.880000 - 0:59:06.960000::And it's cool.
0:59:06.960000 - 0:59:10.800000::And you get to see all the hills of Glendale and Holland
0:59:10.800000 - 0:59:11.600000::Park, whatever.
0:59:11.600000 - 0:59:13.280000::And you see the downtown.
0:59:13.280000 - 0:59:15.880000::And the city's a little hazy, not pollution.
0:59:15.880000 - 0:59:16.840000::It couldn't be that.
0:59:16.840000 - 0:59:19.480000::It's just really good, natural haze.
0:59:19.480000 - 0:59:22.720000::And the mornings have just been really nice lately.
0:59:22.720000 - 0:59:24.120000::I've really been enjoying them.
0:59:24.120000 - 0:59:25.520000::And you get to work.
0:59:25.520000 - 0:59:29.040000::And then you get that iced coffee.
0:59:29.040000 - 0:59:31.600000::And then you get that breakfast sandwich and you chill.
0:59:31.600000 - 0:59:33.400000::The mornings have just been very nice.
0:59:33.400000 - 0:59:35.840000::God, that sounds great.
0:59:35.840000 - 0:59:39.880000::Getting up, it is tough to do on your own, though,
0:59:39.880000 - 0:59:43.920000::without something like forcing you to get up early like that.
0:59:43.920000 - 0:59:44.640000::Oh my god.
0:59:44.640000 - 0:59:49.160000::What I would give to just get up at 6, 5am every day
0:59:49.160000 - 0:59:51.960000::and watch the sunrise.
0:59:51.960000 - 0:59:53.680000::Are you kidding me?
0:59:53.680000 - 0:59:55.600000::With your stepchild or something like that?
0:59:55.600000 - 0:59:58.080000::That sounds beautiful.
0:59:58.080000 - 0:59:58.760000::I'd give anything.
0:59:58.760000 - 1:00:01.240000::We're all going to have stepchildren.

1:00:00 - 1:00:03.200000::for sure and they're all going to be shown to become best friends.
1:00:03.240000 - 1:00:03.960000::There's no question.
1:00:06.200000 - 1:00:06.840000::I can't wait.
1:00:07.480000 - 1:00:09.640000::Well, so we did cream, y'all.
1:00:09.640000 - 1:00:10.760000::We body cream.

1:00:27.680000 - 1:00:29.800000::But for now, it's just in the books.
1:00:30.440000 - 1:00:33.440000::All right, everybody doing some cover episodes.
