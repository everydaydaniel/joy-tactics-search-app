0:00:00 - 0:00:05::Take one look and you'll see.
0:00:05 - 0:00:07::Whatever. Where are you doing?
0:00:07 - 0:00:08::Hey, Chik, let me talk to you for a second.
0:00:08 - 0:00:11::Hey, girl. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
0:00:11 - 0:00:13::Welcome to Joy Tactics.
0:00:13 - 0:00:16::The podcast dedicated to all things joyful, joyous,
0:00:16 - 0:00:20::and meeting as many celebrities as humanly possible.
0:00:20 - 0:00:24::Hosted by Eric Rahill, Nate Veroni, and Jack Bensinger.
0:00:24 - 0:00:26::Enjoy.
0:00:26 - 0:00:31::Yeah.
0:00:31 - 0:00:33::Yes, if you're listening to this right now,
0:00:33 - 0:00:36::you probably think we're at our fucked up desks.
0:00:36 - 0:00:39::And our busted, busted apartments.
0:00:39 - 0:00:41::Wrong.
0:00:41 - 0:00:43::We are getting off the Brooklyn Bridge right now,
0:00:43 - 0:00:46::driving more safe than anyone has.
0:00:46 - 0:00:51::More safely, shall I say, than anyone has ever driven in their lives.
0:00:51 - 0:00:54::So we're about to take you through a time capsule,
0:00:54 - 0:00:57::not just time and space, but through geography as well.
0:00:57 - 0:00:59::We are entering New York City.
0:00:59 - 0:01:01::Well, here's the thing.
0:01:01 - 0:01:04::Yo, Jack, we've lived in New York for how long now?
0:01:04 - 0:01:06::Five, coming on six years.
0:01:06 - 0:01:09::Six years, but if you count the pandemic as two each,
0:01:09 - 0:01:11::then because those were hyper years.
0:01:11 - 0:01:12::The pandemic.
0:01:12 - 0:01:13::That's right.
0:01:13 - 0:01:14::The pandemic.
0:01:14 - 0:01:15::The pandemic.
0:01:15 - 0:01:16::The pandemic.
0:01:16 - 0:01:17::The pandemic.
0:01:17 - 0:01:18::The pandemic.
0:01:18 - 0:01:19::The pandemic.
0:01:19 - 0:01:20::The pandemic.
0:01:20 - 0:01:21::The pandemic.
0:01:21 - 0:01:22::The pandemic.
0:01:22 - 0:01:24::Rancho Cucamalo, Massachusetts.
0:01:24 - 0:01:26::I didn't have that luxury.
0:01:26 - 0:01:28::I get afforded so a few luxuries.
0:01:28 - 0:01:31::I had to rough it out with my remote job.
0:01:31 - 0:01:36::So I'm just saying being in New York for that many years,
0:01:36 - 0:01:38::you start to absorb the history of the city,
0:01:38 - 0:01:39::whether you like it or not.
0:01:39 - 0:01:41::Even if you fucking hate history,
0:01:41 - 0:01:43::you can't help but absorb it.
0:01:43 - 0:01:45::And we have memories all over this town.
0:01:45 - 0:01:46::So here we are right now.
0:01:46 - 0:01:47.500000::We're actually inside the courthouse.
0:01:47.500000 - 0:01:49::When we just got over the Brooklyn Bridge,
0:01:49 - 0:01:51::and you want to know what happened right here?
0:01:51 - 0:01:53.200000::know what happened right here.
0:01:53.200000 - 0:01:55.200000::A historic moment happened here.
0:01:55.200000 - 0:01:58.560000::No gangs of New York was right out here essentially.
0:01:58.560000 - 0:02:03.640000::Well, the biggest gang in New York is the writers gang of America.
0:02:03.640000 - 0:02:05.120000::That's right.
0:02:05.120000 - 0:02:06.120000::Oh, dude.
0:02:06.120000 - 0:02:07.120000::Right there.
0:02:07.120000 - 0:02:09.080000::That's where we shut down devil.
0:02:09.080000 - 0:02:10.600000::Remember that show?
0:02:10.600000 - 0:02:11.600000::Yeah.
0:02:11.600000 - 0:02:12.840000::I don't know.
0:02:12.840000 - 0:02:13.600000::Is that right?
0:02:13.600000 - 0:02:14.600000::Is that the name of it?
0:02:14.600000 - 0:02:15.600000::You shut down devil, bro.
0:02:15.600000 - 0:02:16.600000::Yes, we did right there.
0:02:16.600000 - 0:02:17.600000::They gave up.
0:02:17.600000 - 0:02:18.800000::That's one of the scary flags.
0:02:18.800000 - 0:02:19.800000::And guess what?
0:02:19.800000 - 0:02:26.560000::The people who were running the event, the walking, the picketing.
0:02:26.560000 - 0:02:29.280000::They left all the signs there.
0:02:29.280000 - 0:02:31.960000::And I took them home in a giant garbage bag.
0:02:31.960000 - 0:02:34.600000::And I said, don't worry about it.
0:02:34.600000 - 0:02:39.800000::I've never seen you more rageful or more prone to violence than you were during the WGA strike.
0:02:39.800000 - 0:02:40.800000::Yeah, that was a great difference.
0:02:40.800000 - 0:02:42.800000::I've never seen you like that.
0:02:42.800000 - 0:02:43.800000::I've never seen you.
0:02:43.800000 - 0:02:44.800000::That's something like that.
0:02:44.800000 - 0:02:45.800000::I didn't know that you had that in.
0:02:45.800000 - 0:02:46.800000::You were Dr. Jackal.
0:02:46.800000 - 0:02:47.800000::Jackal.
0:02:47.800000 - 0:02:48.800000::Jackal and hide.
0:02:48.800000 - 0:02:49.800000::Very clever.
0:02:49.800000 - 0:02:50.800000::And Mr. Hide.
0:02:50.800000 - 0:02:51.800000::Yeah.
0:02:51.800000 - 0:02:52.800000::Now you're Mr. Hide.
0:02:52.800000 - 0:02:53.800000::All sweet.
0:02:53.800000 - 0:02:59.320000::Just a podcast to then wait till the fucking streamers break their contracts and drive the
0:02:59.320000 - 0:03:01.640000::stiffy on residuals.
0:03:01.640000 - 0:03:04.120000::That's when Mr. Jackal, Dr. Jackal comes out.
0:03:04.120000 - 0:03:05.840000::That's when I come out of four in the morning.
0:03:05.840000 - 0:03:06.840000::I did one time.
0:03:06.840000 - 0:03:11.880000::I think the stupidest thing I did during the picketing is it was like ghost busters.
0:03:11.880000 - 0:03:13.200000::We were shutting them down.
0:03:13.200000 - 0:03:19.760000::I came out four in the morning and I had brought a bunch of whatever like signs and stuff
0:03:19.760000 - 0:03:20.760000::in a bag.
0:03:20.760000 - 0:03:22.920000::And I didn't want anyone to notice it.
0:03:22.920000 - 0:03:25::Like the crew members to catch wind.
0:03:25 - 0:03:26::Yeah.
0:03:26 - 0:03:29.440000::And so I put on the top of the bag so you couldn't see all the picket materials.
0:03:29.440000 - 0:03:31.240000::I put a bunch of food.
0:03:31.240000 - 0:03:32.960000::So I had a giant bag of food.
0:03:32.960000 - 0:03:33.960000::I was just dragging around.
0:03:33.960000 - 0:03:34.960000::What type of food?
0:03:34.960000 - 0:03:35.960000::The canned goods.
0:03:35.960000 - 0:03:36.960000::The canned goods.
0:03:36.960000 - 0:03:37.960000::The canned goods.
0:03:37.960000 - 0:03:38.960000::The canned goods.
0:03:38.960000 - 0:03:39.960000::The canned goods.
0:03:39.960000 - 0:03:40.960000::The canned goods.
0:03:40.960000 - 0:03:41.960000::Corn beans.
0:03:41.960000 - 0:03:46.600000::So right away that's a deep emotional story that's just been live and within me.
0:03:46.600000 - 0:03:47.600000::Just a long time.
0:03:47.600000 - 0:03:49.800000::Just from the first word of the word.
0:03:49.800000 - 0:03:50.800000::Location, bro.
0:03:50.800000 - 0:03:53.360000::And Nate, this city is so rich.
0:03:53.360000 - 0:03:54.360000::You never lived here?
0:03:54.360000 - 0:03:57.280000::The story is never lived here just by the way.
0:03:57.280000 - 0:03:58.280000::What?
0:03:58.280000 - 0:04:01.280000::He never lived in New York, bro.
0:04:01.280000 - 0:04:02.280000::That's hilarious.
0:04:02.280000 - 0:04:05.280000::That is hilarious, bro.
0:04:05.280000 - 0:04:06.840000::You're basically soft.
0:04:06.840000 - 0:04:14.760000::But I've basically lived in more types of terrains and varied terrain environments than
0:04:14.760000 - 0:04:16.640000::you all have ever had in your life.
0:04:16.640000 - 0:04:17.640000::Oh, like what?
0:04:17.640000 - 0:04:18.640000::You've lived in a ring and terrain?
0:04:18.640000 - 0:04:19.640000::Oh, no.
0:04:19.640000 - 0:04:20.640000::Funny again.
0:04:20.640000 - 0:04:21.640000::It's so good.
0:04:21.640000 - 0:04:22.640000::Yeah, we're in a ring.
0:04:22.640000 - 0:04:23.640000::Rinscape, terrain.
0:04:23.640000 - 0:04:24.640000::Yeah.
0:04:24.640000 - 0:04:25.640000::Oh.
0:04:25.640000 - 0:04:26.640000::Super Mario Bros.
0:04:26.640000 - 0:04:27.640000::That's the type of land.
0:04:27.640000 - 0:04:28.640000::Yeah.
0:04:28.640000 - 0:04:35.240000::What I'm talking about is rural Ohio, where the real Americans are.
0:04:35.240000 - 0:04:36.640000::The real racist ones?
0:04:36.640000 - 0:04:37.640000::Yeah.
0:04:37.640000 - 0:04:40.800000::And I'm done.
0:04:40.800000 - 0:04:42.040000::And I'm done.
0:04:42.040000 - 0:04:43.800000::Let me out of the car right now.
0:04:43.800000 - 0:04:44.800000::You wish.
0:04:44.800000 - 0:04:45.800000::You don't even know how to get it out in the city.
0:04:45.800000 - 0:04:49.040000::You get it right on a ride taxi immediately.
0:04:49.040000 - 0:04:51.200000::Yo, we're coming up.
0:04:51.200000 - 0:04:52.200000::OK.
0:04:52.200000 - 0:04:55.960000::So just to give you guys an idea, if you don't mean there's a Manhattan being there.
0:04:55.960000 - 0:04:56.960000::Why don't you call it?
0:04:56.960000 - 0:04:59.560000::Oh, that one doesn't hold a candle.

0:05:00 - 0:05:03.100000::I want to give the listeners a vibe of where we are.
0:05:03.100000 - 0:05:05.440000::We are just, we're coming from Brooklyn Bridge,
0:05:05.440000 - 0:05:07.040000::financial district.
0:05:07.040000 - 0:05:11.280000::We are coming up into Soho.
0:05:11.280000 - 0:05:13.320000::We're passing a theater called The Roxy,
0:05:13.320000 - 0:05:15.720000::where I've hosted more short film screenings
0:05:15.720000 - 0:05:20.620000::than probably any other creator on the map right now.
0:05:20.620000 - 0:05:21.520000::And you know what's funny?
0:05:21.520000 - 0:05:23.760000::Just start to name some of the things you've seen there.
0:05:23.760000 - 0:05:25::Oh my fucking god.
0:05:25 - 0:05:26.520000::I saw the...
0:05:26.520000 - 0:05:30.120000::I saw the short films.
0:05:30.120000 - 0:05:33.960000::I'm still here where I saw Spike Lee walking.
0:05:33.960000 - 0:05:34.960000::Oh.
0:05:34.960000 - 0:05:37.800000::I saw all sorts of short films.
0:05:37.800000 - 0:05:39.680000::Can I describe my celebrity sightings?
0:05:39.680000 - 0:05:40.680000::Please.
0:05:40.680000 - 0:05:41.680000::The other day, because I posted this on the...
0:05:41.680000 - 0:05:43.840000::Please, Joy-Dacted in Seeram.
0:05:43.840000 - 0:05:46.880000::The busted paparazzi strikes again.
0:05:46.880000 - 0:05:52.320000::So I went down to the subway system on 7th and 9th.
0:05:52.320000 - 0:05:54.080000::The F does that make sense?
0:05:54.080000 - 0:05:54.840000::That makes sense.
0:05:54.840000 - 0:05:55.720000::To me it makes sense.
0:05:55.720000 - 0:05:59.280000::I went down there and a cop immediately was kind of...
0:05:59.280000 - 0:06:00.280000::Boo.
0:06:00.280000 - 0:06:01.280000::Yeah.
0:06:01.280000 - 0:06:02.280000::Boo.
0:06:02.280000 - 0:06:03.280000::Get a real job.
0:06:03.280000 - 0:06:04.280000::It was hassling me and he said,
0:06:04.280000 - 0:06:05.280000::Hey, hey, hey, sit.
0:06:05.280000 - 0:06:07.280000::Stay on the other side of the tracks.
0:06:07.280000 - 0:06:08.760000::The train's going on this side.
0:06:08.760000 - 0:06:10.280000::And I was like, let's call it a car trip.
0:06:10.280000 - 0:06:11.280000::That's called a car trip.
0:06:11.280000 - 0:06:13.240000::I don't live here, so I just went along with it.
0:06:13.240000 - 0:06:15.240000::Maybe this is what happens at this time of the day
0:06:15.240000 - 0:06:16.400000::in the subway or something.
0:06:16.400000 - 0:06:17.840000::I don't know.
0:06:17.840000 - 0:06:23.560000::And I walk past into the subway and I see a stationary subway car.
0:06:23.560000 - 0:06:25.400000::And I'm like, what's going on here?
0:06:25.400000 - 0:06:26.880000::This is just wide open.
0:06:26.880000 - 0:06:29.720000::All the doors are open on each of the carts.
0:06:29.720000 - 0:06:32.360000::And I look in and who's fucking there?
0:06:32.360000 - 0:06:34.840000::Mr. Denzel fucking Washington.
0:06:34.840000 - 0:06:35.840000::Just sit in there.
0:06:35.840000 - 0:06:36.840000::Oh.
0:06:36.840000 - 0:06:40.240000::And I'll tell you, I don't get star struck often
0:06:40.240000 - 0:06:42.920000::because I'm seeing celebrities on a daily basis.
0:06:42.920000 - 0:06:45.400000::And I've been around them many times.
0:06:45.400000 - 0:06:49.080000::But when I saw Denzel something happened to me.
0:06:49.080000 - 0:06:49.600000::D.W.
0:06:49.600000 - 0:06:50.080000::Bonaural.
0:06:50.080000 - 0:06:50.920000::Bonaural.
0:06:50.920000 - 0:06:51.760000::Bonaural.
0:06:51.760000 - 0:06:52.600000::Bonaural.
0:06:52.600000 - 0:06:53.600000::Come on, man.
0:06:53.600000 - 0:06:54.200000::Chill, chill.
0:06:54.200000 - 0:06:56.640000::That's not funny to joke about.
0:06:56.640000 - 0:06:58.360000::But he was looking sexy and we looked up his face.
0:06:58.360000 - 0:06:59.600000::I saw that picture.
0:06:59.600000 - 0:07:00.440000::What is he?
0:07:00.440000 - 0:07:01.320000::70, dude.
0:07:01.320000 - 0:07:02.640000::He looks good.
0:07:02.640000 - 0:07:07.400000::He, him and also many famous women as well
0:07:07.400000 - 0:07:10.320000::are redefining what age means in this day and age.
0:07:10.320000 - 0:07:12.120000::And today's modern age.
0:07:12.120000 - 0:07:12.960000::Thank God.
0:07:12.960000 - 0:07:16.080000::But I walked a little bit, looked to my left.
0:07:16.080000 - 0:07:18.040000::And there was a bunch of cameras and shit.
0:07:18.040000 - 0:07:19.920000::And I was like, oh, this is, of course.
0:07:19.920000 - 0:07:21.080000::You know what's funny, though, Nate?
0:07:21.080000 - 0:07:21.800000::It's Spike Lee, maybe.
0:07:21.800000 - 0:07:23.720000::You know what's funny, though?
0:07:23.720000 - 0:07:27.560000::To you, that's like a crazy one's in a lifetime experience.
0:07:27.560000 - 0:07:29.160000::And if another tourist saw that shit,
0:07:29.160000 - 0:07:32.080000::they'd be like, what the fuck is my life right now?
0:07:32.080000 - 0:07:35.200000::To me and Jack who live here and have lived here
0:07:35.200000 - 0:07:39.600000::for almost six years, that's fucking almost boring, bro.
0:07:39.600000 - 0:07:41.320000::Like that would make me fall asleep in the ass of that.
0:07:41.320000 - 0:07:42.920000::I actually forgot what you were talking about.
0:07:42.920000 - 0:07:44.920000::Well, what we were talking about is you guys

0:07:53.600000 - 0:07:55::New Yorker, don't think about LA.
0:07:55 - 0:07:57.080000::New Yorker, definition of jaded.
0:07:57.080000 - 0:07:59.640000::How could I be jaded with so many bagel opportunities?
0:07:59.640000 - 0:08:02.120000::And we're just passing the most crazy
0:08:02.120000 - 0:08:04.240000::as pickleball fucking court I've ever seen.
0:08:04.240000 - 0:08:07.440000::Pickleball is alive and well in New York City.

0:08:20.680000 - 0:08:23.680000::Lord knows that you are doing nothing for the company at all.
0:08:23.680000 - 0:08:25.560000::You are one or two hours a day.
0:08:25.560000 - 0:08:26.840000::Imagine nothing at all.
0:08:26.840000 - 0:08:27.360000::Chill.

0:08:40.320000 - 0:08:42.360000::That's why you felt comfortable talking shit.
0:08:42.360000 - 0:08:43.120000::Well, guess what?
0:08:43.120000 - 0:08:45.320000::Some of my best friends are account managers.
0:08:45.320000 - 0:08:47.440000::And if you think that they're not working hard,
0:08:47.440000 - 0:08:50.280000::these people, whether it's important or not,

0:09:19.760000 - 0:09:22.640000::So now you're thinking a little bit differently
0:09:22.640000 - 0:09:23.600000::about how I was talking.
0:09:23.600000 - 0:09:26.480000::Because I'm coming from lived experience.
0:09:26.480000 - 0:09:28.200000::You never heard that phrase, have you?
0:09:28.200000 - 0:09:31.240000::Lived experience.
0:09:31.240000 - 0:09:34::No, I guess I haven't.

0:09:47.700000 - 0:09:48.540000::of the spelled area.
0:09:48.540000 - 0:09:51.380000::That's about 70 blocked up this way.
0:09:51.380000 - 0:09:53.420000::They've clearly just paved the road.
0:09:53.420000 - 0:09:54.140000::They paved the roads.
0:09:54.140000 - 0:09:54.900000::There's no lines.
0:09:54.900000 - 0:09:58.220000::People are driving as if it's a different type of country.
0:09:58.220000 - 0:10:01.140000::Do you guys think this is going to be like a?

0:10:00 - 0:10:06::time capsule sort of episode where like in 30 years from now like people will pull up this video like
0:10:06.080000 - 0:10:09.600000::This is what it was like to live in New York City in 2024
0:10:09.600000 - 0:10:12::Well, they can't see out the window. I think that's part of the
0:10:12.320000 - 0:10:17.280000::Well the way that we're describing it in the detail at which we're describing and the speed at which videos
0:10:17.920000 - 0:10:19.440000::scare though
0:10:19.440000 - 0:10:24.720000::Fuck out of me when I see them you know because they sped up the old film to look a little more like
0:10:25.200000 - 0:10:27.200000::Really give me a little bit of the sunroof
0:10:27.600000 - 0:10:29.600000::Oh
0:10:30.400000 - 0:10:34.640000::You all notice how I'm not looking at the camera. I'm driving so safely and so aware
0:10:34.640000 - 0:10:38.560000::We're also praying to get into an accident not because we want to wish harm on ourselves
0:10:38.640000 - 0:10:44.560000::But because we value virality over anything in our lives. It's destroying the safety
0:10:46.400000 - 0:10:50.320000::But yeah, if we got into a wreck man, are you could you could you
0:10:51.280000 - 0:10:54.320000::You don't even know about the monetization that would happen from that
0:10:55.120000 - 0:10:57.600000::What you mean? Oh, you said insurance wise
0:10:58.800000 - 0:11:01.120000::The views would pay for all of our medical costs
0:11:02.080000 - 0:11:04.480000::I refuse medical treatment. It's a scam
0:11:05.840000 - 0:11:11.440000::Can we get medical insurance through like as the as we should have we should have you need
0:11:11.760000 - 0:11:16.240000::You need like you need 15k views a video to get hell insurance for the shit
0:11:16.720000 - 0:11:23.360000::There's got to be a way to hack that I think we need to offer a help like get a blue cross blue shield deal with
0:11:24.320000 - 0:11:25.840000::With uh

0:12:40.720000 - 0:12:45.680000::Post no bills feel no thrills is that from something mad villain style. That's amazing
0:12:46.640000 - 0:12:49.120000::Mm-hmm and that's doom
0:12:49.440000 - 0:12:53.200000::Oh, you know what you guys not to bring it back but
0:12:54 - 0:12:57.840000::Is pickle ball a big thing in New York City specifically?

0:13:05.600000 - 0:13:12::So I was going to meet up and play pickle ball with a dear friend his name is Sam Campbell
0:13:12 - 0:13:18.560000::He's Australian and he's probably even him a brain that has equipped him to do things that most could never do quite humorous humorously
0:13:19.280000 - 0:13:27.440000::Okay, now I don't know where my lane is. I'm just go just floor it all just floor it all brother plays and we went to play pickle ball
0:13:27.680000 - 0:13:34.400000::Mm-hmm and he at this point in his life had never had a smartphone. This was about one one year ago big pot hole
0:13:35.120000 - 0:13:39.440000::um, and so he had googled it and we met up and it didn't exist and
0:13:40 - 0:13:45.760000::Then we tried to find a pickle ball core and we couldn't do it, but we didn't we didn't use a smartphone
0:13:46.480000 - 0:13:48.480000::Oh, and you know, it's funny
0:13:48.720000 - 0:13:55.360000::What what what tell me now please? I can't wait to hear what's funny is because this is gonna relate to the bonus episode this week as well
0:13:55.440000 - 0:13:59.920000::What I think I also didn't realize I had COVID during this hangout as well
0:14:00.800000 - 0:14:06.400000::I'm noticing a pattern. I'm noticing a pattern. Not enough for it to matter. Not enough for to
0:14:06.400000 - 0:14:08.400000::Yeah, definitely not affecting my house
0:14:09.520000 - 0:14:15.520000::I feel like there is a hundred percent chance that I get sick on this New York trip. No, don't say that. I can't get sick right now
0:14:16.080000 - 0:14:20.320000::I feel like I can feel something just dating like and not in a way that I can feel it
0:14:20.720000 - 0:14:26.320000::No, it's because you had the Guinness is last time. I've just been around too many too many there

0:14:38.560000 - 0:14:42::I don't have some sort of illness inside of me that my body is fighting off
0:14:42.960000 - 0:14:48.320000::In a crazy way how do I you know you just manifest at a bacteria to go right in the brain stem right now
0:14:48.320000 - 0:14:50.320000::Nate say the opposite right now
0:14:50.320000 - 0:14:54.880000::There's no way I'm getting I'm here. I'm I'm healed and
0:14:56.400000 - 0:15:00.080000::That's what I thought there you go washed away. I'm afraid for this cop to see the mind

0:15:00 - 0:15:07.220000::Okay, it's all good. Oh, this is the least I can see. I know what I fucking run yellows like it's my day job out here my skin runs yellow sometimes
0:15:08.700000 - 0:15:10.700000::So what I'm saying
0:15:12.700000 - 0:15:22.560000::Is we are getting dangerously close to what's called Central Park. We're on oh, yeah, 26th Street. That's a very difficult street to say
0:15:23.820000 - 0:15:26.640000::For you maybe well, okay, man
0:15:27.060000 - 0:15:29.060000::so

0:15:40.700000 - 0:15:42.940000::So what's funny is that none of these
0:15:43.900000 - 0:15:45.900000::Do you ever feel
0:15:46.500000 - 0:15:50.820000::Basically extreme vertigo being around a bunch of really tall buildings?
0:15:50.820000 - 0:15:54.660000::I used to jack until I got the CPAP and now well

0:15:59.060000 - 0:16:05.020000::Well, you're not the only one I stayed up for six days and then I watched inception at which point?
0:16:08.060000 - 0:16:13.620000::Why would you do that to yourself because that's how they prescribed you to watch it. You didn't listen to Leonardo DiCaprio
0:16:14.460000 - 0:16:19.300000::No, I don't watch interviews with actors because I don't want to be you remembering that they're not their characters
0:16:19.300000 - 0:16:21.300000::So why did they name it?
0:16:21.300000 - 0:16:23.300000::Oh

0:24:23.620000 - 0:24:28.580000::Because you're getting a little too over eager to just sell the product when you need to think about the health of the business as a whole

0:25:15.040000 - 0:25:16.720000::to door sales.
0:25:16.720000 - 0:25:24::Imagine that your family is in the basement of a very bad person's sort of house they've
0:25:24 - 0:25:25.480000::been kidnapped.
0:25:25.480000 - 0:25:31.920000::And if you don't fucking 3x your revenue this month, they fucking die.

0:25:43.240000 - 0:25:47.440000::So why do you have to have this imaginary scenario happen in your head to be the best version
0:25:47.440000 - 0:25:53.240000::of yourself to be what you what to rock in to fully live out your potential?
0:25:53.240000 - 0:25:59.280000::It's an American sickness, bro, that people need to be motivated by a violence, humiliation

0:26:15.520000 - 0:26:18.160000::And by the way that doesn't just go for people in sales.
0:26:18.160000 - 0:26:23.080000::You don't realize that everything that is in commerce is sales dude.
0:26:23.080000 - 0:26:24.440000::Do you understand that?
0:26:24.440000 - 0:26:28.040000::So yeah if you're working at a diner and you're not taking this seriously that there's new

0:36:27.080000 - 0:36:29.400000::make money professionally doing that shit.
0:36:29.400000 - 0:36:31.840000::And by at least three Macbooks.
0:36:31.840000 - 0:36:32.840000::What is on that?
0:36:32.840000 - 0:36:34.400000::The first one in front of us.
0:36:34.400000 - 0:36:35.240000::Right.
0:36:35.240000 - 0:36:37.280000::That's an advertisement for Mad Max Fereoza.
0:36:37.280000 - 0:36:38.280000::Oh, really?
0:36:38.280000 - 0:36:38.960000::Yeah.
0:36:38.960000 - 0:36:43.200000::Which we will be on from the theater and leaking to the patrons,
0:36:43.200000 - 0:36:47.120000::which we do with every sort of blockbuster.
0:36:47.120000 - 0:36:49.320000::I'll tell you, it looks like an advertisement for it.
0:36:49.320000 - 0:36:50.920000::We did it with that new city-sweeney movie.
0:36:50.920000 - 0:36:52.400000::Yes, we did.
0:36:52.400000 - 0:36:54::Looks like they're advertising a militia that
0:36:54 - 0:36:55.840000::takes place in a hospital where they ain't
0:36:55.840000 - 0:36:57.400000::got much time left.
0:36:57.400000 - 0:36:58.960000::I'm actually so stoked for that.
0:36:58.960000 - 0:36:59.800000::For you.
0:36:59.800000 - 0:37:00.800000::It's a Mad Max.
0:37:00.800000 - 0:37:02.160000::Is it Italian?
0:37:02.160000 - 0:37:03.400000::Mad Max Fereoza.
0:37:03.400000 - 0:37:04.400000::Fereoza.
0:37:04.400000 - 0:37:06.400000::Fereoza.
0:37:06.400000 - 0:37:10.040000::Have you seen any of the Mad Max's, Jack?
0:37:10.040000 - 0:37:12.960000::Just the first five minutes of one of them, yeah.
0:37:12.960000 - 0:37:14.480000::This car's going so slow.
0:37:14.480000 - 0:37:15::It's real.
0:37:15 - 0:37:15.760000::Why?
0:37:15.760000 - 0:37:16.680000::Are you kidding me?
0:37:16.680000 - 0:37:16.840000::No.
0:37:16.840000 - 0:37:18.600000::Actually, yo, if you're listening to this,
0:37:18.600000 - 0:37:19.800000::I don't get violent movies.
0:37:19.800000 - 0:37:21.040000::I don't get road rage.
0:37:21.040000 - 0:37:23.160000::I'm very patient.
0:37:23.160000 - 0:37:24.280000::I get road love.
0:37:24.280000 - 0:37:25.800000::If somebody cuts me off, I look at it.
0:37:25.840000 - 0:37:26.840000::What are you going through?
0:37:26.840000 - 0:37:29.440000::Smash an end of them and get them there further.
0:37:29.440000 - 0:37:30.960000::This person's got a meeting.
0:37:30.960000 - 0:37:32.440000::This person's hungry.
0:37:32.440000 - 0:37:33.480000::You've got to take a shizz.
0:37:33.480000 - 0:37:34.320000::You know what I think?
0:37:34.320000 - 0:37:35.920000::I concur.
0:37:35.920000 - 0:37:37.520000::But.
0:37:37.520000 - 0:37:39.640000::Man, oh, wait.
0:37:39.640000 - 0:37:43.400000::We're about to literally drive past Sauron's fucking building.
0:37:43.400000 - 0:37:45.760000::Sauron's tower itself.
0:37:45.760000 - 0:37:46.720000::Bro, that is what.
0:37:46.720000 - 0:37:48.880000::Trump tower is your right fucking hair.
0:37:48.880000 - 0:37:52.120000::Yeah, Trump International Hotel.
0:37:52.120000 - 0:37:55.440000::AKA fucking evil ass hotel.
0:37:55.440000 - 0:37:56.280000::Interesting.
0:37:56.280000 - 0:37:57.960000::Oh, I was wondering why I look like Cheetos
0:37:57.960000 - 0:37:58.480000::in the air.
0:37:58.480000 - 0:37:59.480000::No.
0:37:59.480000 - 0:38:00.480000::No.
0:38:00.480000 - 0:38:01.480000::No.
0:38:01.480000 - 0:38:02.480000::No.
0:38:02.480000 - 0:38:03.480000::No.
0:38:03.480000 - 0:38:05.440000::I do feel like my left arm's going down.
0:38:05.440000 - 0:38:06.920000::What the fuck?
0:38:06.920000 - 0:38:09.480000::Oh, that's just because of what could that be?
0:38:09.480000 - 0:38:10::Muscle gain.
0:38:10 - 0:38:10.720000::That's not death.
0:38:10.720000 - 0:38:11.520000::It's muscle gain.
0:38:11.520000 - 0:38:12.360000::That's so fun.
0:38:12.360000 - 0:38:16.360000::It's real on your window here.
0:38:16.360000 - 0:38:17.560000::Donald Trump!
0:38:17.560000 - 0:38:18.080000::Yeah.
0:38:18.080000 - 0:38:20.160000::You raised the position.
0:38:20.160000 - 0:38:22.760000::You raised the position.
0:38:22.760000 - 0:38:24.160000::And Nate, that's very funny.
0:38:24.160000 - 0:38:26.040000::But someone did just set themselves on fire
0:38:26.040000 - 0:38:27.320000::recently around here.
0:38:27.320000 - 0:38:28.440000::Was that around?
0:38:28.440000 - 0:38:29.280000::Was it really around?
0:38:29.280000 - 0:38:29.800000::Yeah.
0:38:29.800000 - 0:38:30.800000::Wait, the crypto guy?
0:38:30.800000 - 0:38:31.800000::Yeah.
0:38:31.800000 - 0:38:32.640000::Oh, my.
0:38:32.640000 - 0:38:33.600000::Oh, my.
0:38:33.600000 - 0:38:36.760000::So that was funny, but.
0:38:36.760000 - 0:38:40.840000::But well, what you don't realize is that humor can exist
0:38:40.840000 - 0:38:45.160000::in ways that can lighten sort of these dark moments
0:38:45.160000 - 0:38:48.160000::that we're experiencing, and that people need comedy.
0:38:48.160000 - 0:38:49.480000::And they need humor.
0:38:49.480000 - 0:38:52.800000::And people want to say that you can't joke about certain things,
0:38:52.800000 - 0:38:53.920000::certain topics.
0:38:53.920000 - 0:38:54.760000::Right.
0:38:54.760000 - 0:38:57.080000::Which I agree with, in some extent.
0:38:57.080000 - 0:39:00.840000::But in another extent, everything's not black and white as well.
0:39:00.840000 - 0:39:02.480000::Certainly not.
0:39:02.480000 - 0:39:03.840000::Eric, you're OK, man.
0:39:03.840000 - 0:39:04.760000::You don't think?
0:39:04.760000 - 0:39:07.040000::You think if this was a medical emergency,
0:39:07.040000 - 0:39:08.200000::I would be feeling it more intense.
0:39:08.200000 - 0:39:09.520000::I wouldn't worry about it, because you're
0:39:09.520000 - 0:39:10.840000::in the safest city in the world.
0:39:10.840000 - 0:39:11.840000::Right, right.
0:39:11.840000 - 0:39:14.280000::Wasn't it a CPR, a hind leg?
0:39:14.280000 - 0:39:15.720000::For some reason, it feels like both my arms
0:39:15.720000 - 0:39:16.760000::are falling asleep.
0:39:16.760000 - 0:39:18.120000::Oh, if it's both of them, then you're good.
0:39:18.120000 - 0:39:18.960000::Yeah, I think it's just cool.
0:39:18.960000 - 0:39:21.080000::I feel like my head and eyes are falling asleep.
0:39:21.080000 - 0:39:23.240000::What's that about?
0:39:23.240000 - 0:39:25.920000::I feel like you know that massage gun.
0:39:25.920000 - 0:39:27.640000::And you put it in, it starts to go numb.
0:39:27.640000 - 0:39:28.400000::You're feeling that, too?
0:39:28.400000 - 0:39:29.640000::I feel that in my brain.
0:39:29.640000 - 0:39:30.640000::Oh, fuck.
0:39:30.640000 - 0:39:31.640000::I feel like my brain is losing.
0:39:31.640000 - 0:39:34.120000::I thought we'd be able to relate on the arm thing.
0:39:34.120000 - 0:39:36::Well, physically we're not meant to hold a mic.
0:39:36 - 0:39:36.800000::It isn't a car.
0:39:36.800000 - 0:39:37.720000::Mine's not my ever.
0:39:37.720000 - 0:39:39::We weren't meant to be doing it.
0:39:39 - 0:39:40.480000::We weren't built like this.
0:39:40.480000 - 0:39:41.720000::Unless you're Mike Sonota.
0:39:41.720000 - 0:39:43.040000::Unless you're always practicing.
0:39:43.040000 - 0:39:43.960000::Theobone.
0:39:43.960000 - 0:39:46.960000::When I pretend everything is that you want me to be,
0:39:46.960000 - 0:39:49.320000::I never thought that what I'd say it had you running for me.
0:39:49.320000 - 0:39:50.200000::Like this.
0:39:50.200000 - 0:39:51.920000::Bro, you got to pay him a royalty now.
0:39:51.920000 - 0:39:55.480000::Well, I pay him a royalty's everyday already on Venmo.
0:39:55.480000 - 0:39:57.760000::Mike Sonota, please return my messages.
0:39:57.760000 - 0:39:59::I'll send you $200,000.
0:39:59 - 0:40:01::I actually see you in 350.

0:40:00 - 0:40:02.400000::I meant to say $35.
0:40:02.400000 - 0:40:03.880000::Send it back if you're listening.
0:40:07.080000 - 0:40:10.960000::So Central Park has a darkness to it.
0:40:10.960000 - 0:40:11.800000::Does it not?
0:40:11.800000 - 0:40:14.600000::And then I need to have that night that we...
0:40:14.600000 - 0:40:15.600000::Don't bring out.
0:40:15.600000 - 0:40:17.040000::Are you talking about the freaks coming out?
0:40:17.040000 - 0:40:20.120000::Don't you ever, you guys been doing some investigations?
0:40:20.120000 - 0:40:21.280000::Yeah, we have.
0:40:21.280000 - 0:40:25.200000::Let's just say that there is a new brand of,
0:40:25.200000 - 0:40:26.920000::what's it called, Raybees.
0:40:26.920000 - 0:40:28.360000::That is sexually transmitted.
0:40:28.360000 - 0:40:29.480000::And people are coming here
0:40:29.480000 - 0:40:31::and they're trying to get on purpose.
0:40:31 - 0:40:32.400000::Were you dick, bee foaming?
0:40:32.400000 - 0:40:33.640000::Were you dick foaming?
0:40:33.640000 - 0:40:36.440000::Yeah, foaming out the pussy?
0:40:36.440000 - 0:40:37.240000::Whoa.
0:40:37.240000 - 0:40:37.760000::Nate.
0:40:37.760000 - 0:40:38.600000::Dude, that's enough.
0:40:38.600000 - 0:40:39.920000::You just had the pee words.
0:40:39.920000 - 0:40:40.920000::That's enough.
0:40:40.920000 - 0:40:42.080000::Dude, not school.
0:40:42.080000 - 0:40:43.400000::Don't laugh, don't laugh.
0:40:43.400000 - 0:40:44.920000::Yeah, that's hilarious, man.
0:40:44.920000 - 0:40:46.800000::Did say the most.
0:40:46.800000 - 0:40:47.760000::Here's what I would do.
0:40:47.760000 - 0:40:48.600000::Nate, whatever you would.
0:40:48.600000 - 0:40:50.840000::If you were my kid and you just said,
0:40:50.840000 - 0:40:52.080000::see like that, guess what I would do.
0:40:52.080000 - 0:40:54.600000::That's a gentle parenting moment of fully ignoring you.
0:40:54.600000 - 0:40:55.600000::I know what you're doing.
0:40:55.600000 - 0:40:56.840000::I wouldn't gentle parenting you.
0:40:56.840000 - 0:40:58.520000::I'd make you smoke the whole pack.
0:40:58.520000 - 0:41:01.240000::I would make you say pussy 100,000 times Mr. Bee style
0:41:01.240000 - 0:41:02.160000::on the livestream.
0:41:02.160000 - 0:41:03.360000::Pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy.
0:41:03.360000 - 0:41:04.240000::You know what I'm saying?
0:41:04.240000 - 0:41:08.360000::Until your tongue falls off, slash it on your own teeth.
0:41:08.360000 - 0:41:10.960000::Do you guys, somebody told me I have circular teeth recently.
0:41:10.960000 - 0:41:11.880000::Is that true?
0:41:11.880000 - 0:41:12.480000::Who said that?
0:41:12.480000 - 0:41:14.480000::Hmm.
0:41:14.480000 - 0:41:18.520000::I mean, I'm not going to dead name the, not dead name,
0:41:18.520000 - 0:41:20.040000::but I'm not going to call them docs of them
0:41:20.040000 - 0:41:22.920000::because we want to have them on the podcast soon.
0:41:22.920000 - 0:41:24.400000::Right.
0:41:24.400000 - 0:41:25.040000::Right.
0:41:25.040000 - 0:41:26.960000::There's so many relationships though.
0:41:26.960000 - 0:41:30.120000::I like to burn, but because they're a potential podcast.
0:41:30.120000 - 0:41:31.120000::Right.
0:41:31.120000 - 0:41:32.520000::You can't say shit.
0:41:32.520000 - 0:41:34.280000::It's kind of stalling my life, frankly.
0:41:34.280000 - 0:41:36.080000::Do you think there's something I could say so quietly
0:41:36.080000 - 0:41:37.880000::into the mic that only the listeners could hear?
0:41:37.880000 - 0:41:39.560000::Are you guys good in here?
0:41:39.560000 - 0:41:40.400000::Yeah.
0:41:40.400000 - 0:41:41.120000::Maybe.
0:41:41.120000 - 0:41:41.960000::Try it.
0:41:44.080000 - 0:41:45.080000::What's up everybody?
0:41:45.080000 - 0:41:45.920000::Can you hear this?
0:41:45.920000 - 0:41:46.760000::No, actually.
0:41:46.760000 - 0:41:49.400000::Hey man, so just everybody knows.
0:41:49.400000 - 0:41:50.520000::Mike, prepare for the game.
0:41:50.520000 - 0:41:52.880000::I have an amazing, I have a really,
0:41:52.880000 - 0:41:54.680000::fucking awesome surprise going for these guys
0:41:54.680000 - 0:41:56.720000::at the top of minute that they don't know about.
0:41:56.720000 - 0:41:58.720000::I can hear what you're saying now.
0:41:58.720000 - 0:41:59.640000::No, you can't.
0:41:59.640000 - 0:42:01.040000::Yes, I can.
0:42:01.040000 - 0:42:01.920000::All right.
0:42:01.920000 - 0:42:03.480000::Well, basically what's going to happen is
0:42:03.480000 - 0:42:05.600000::we're going to get to the top of minute.
0:42:05.600000 - 0:42:07.880000::I have a bunch of people who are going to high-check this car.
0:42:07.880000 - 0:42:10.280000::And they're going to think that it's real.
0:42:10.280000 - 0:42:11.800000::And they're going to come in with guns and shit.
0:42:11.800000 - 0:42:15::And Eric's going to get fucking what's it called?
0:42:15 - 0:42:17.040000::Gun butted, whatever it's called.
0:42:17.040000 - 0:42:19.280000::Gun butted.
0:42:19.280000 - 0:42:21.040000::And it's actually jackass and these guys
0:42:21.040000 - 0:42:23.400000::are the stars of the next Jackass movies.
0:42:23.400000 - 0:42:26::Would you guys be in Jackass for real?
0:42:26 - 0:42:27.280000::What am I doing in it?
0:42:27.280000 - 0:42:29.920000::Well, Eric, you're just doing the mental stuff.
0:42:29.920000 - 0:42:31.440000::Oh yeah, mental jackass.
0:42:31.440000 - 0:42:32.920000::Mental jackass.
0:42:32.920000 - 0:42:35.520000::People have to like, you have to get the worst insults of your life.
0:42:35.520000 - 0:42:38.280000::All right, Eric's mom is going to say what she really thinks.
0:42:38.280000 - 0:42:39.320000::Go for him.
0:42:39.320000 - 0:42:42.080000::Eric's going to do 600 milligrams of THC.
0:42:42.080000 - 0:42:43::We'll talk to his mom.
0:42:43 - 0:42:44.520000::Oh my god.
0:42:44.520000 - 0:42:46.040000::I don't know what he's going through.
0:42:46.040000 - 0:42:48.160000::I don't think if someone paid me a million dollars,
0:42:48.160000 - 0:42:50.320000::I wouldn't do 600 milligrams of THC.
0:42:50.320000 - 0:42:52.680000::What if they paid you a million dollars a second?
0:42:52.680000 - 0:42:53.680000::All right.
0:42:53.680000 - 0:42:54.440000::That's a yes.
0:42:57 - 0:42:58.720000::I think it would break me forever.
0:42:58.720000 - 0:43:01.680000::And so many things have already broken me forever.
0:43:01.680000 - 0:43:03.320000::Yeah.
0:43:03.320000 - 0:43:04.960000::There's only so many pieces of me.
0:43:04.960000 - 0:43:06.120000::You know what I'm saying?
0:43:06.120000 - 0:43:07.800000::Ashley Simpson.
0:43:07.800000 - 0:43:08.560000::What's that song called?
0:43:08.560000 - 0:43:09.920000::Peasies of Me?
0:43:09.920000 - 0:43:10.760000::On a mother's ring.
0:43:10.760000 - 0:43:12.120000::So she got it.
0:43:12.120000 - 0:43:13.680000::Ashley Simpson and Ryan Cabrera.
0:43:13.680000 - 0:43:14.960000::I'm from President.
0:43:14.960000 - 0:43:16.840000::Ryan Cabrera.
0:43:16.840000 - 0:43:20.840000::Ryan Cabrera, one o' tricks point, never collab.
0:43:20.840000 - 0:43:21.760000::Let me see that Photoshop.
0:43:21.760000 - 0:43:22.760000::You're doing me.
0:43:22.760000 - 0:43:23.600000::We haven't.
0:43:23.600000 - 0:43:28.280000::Driven past one New York icon, one New York celebrity.
0:43:28.280000 - 0:43:29.280000::You just don't have the eye.
0:43:29.280000 - 0:43:33::You know how pro they are hiding in Plansight in New York, bro.
0:43:33 - 0:43:34.160000::Look for the baseball hats.
0:43:34.160000 - 0:43:36.640000::Look for the fucking stunner shades.
0:43:36.640000 - 0:43:38.840000::Every single one of these people are most likely celebrities
0:43:38.840000 - 0:43:39.600000::as well.
0:43:39.600000 - 0:43:41.800000::That's what's so cool about New Yorkers.
0:43:41.800000 - 0:43:42.960000::They don't need that front.
0:43:42.960000 - 0:43:44.600000::It's a city of micro celebrities.
0:43:44.600000 - 0:43:48.360000::They just settle for the good stuff.
0:43:48.360000 - 0:43:49.200000::Cha-ching.
0:43:49.200000 - 0:43:49.720000::Cha-ching.
0:43:49.720000 - 0:43:51.520000::Cha-ching.
0:43:51.520000 - 0:43:52.040000::Cha-ching.
0:43:52.040000 - 0:43:53.040000::What's the name?
0:43:53.040000 - 0:43:55.600000::I don't think that.
0:43:55.600000 - 0:43:56.600000::We're off.
0:43:56.600000 - 0:43:59.760000::I think a point is going to come soon when I'm going to win every single episode of Joy
0:43:59.760000 - 0:44:00.760000::Tactics off the internet.
0:44:00.760000 - 0:44:02.960000::Take scrubbed from the internet.
0:44:02.960000 - 0:44:03.960000::Yeah.
0:44:03.960000 - 0:44:08.200000::Once you start running for office, I'm going to run for all sorts of office and all sorts
0:44:08.200000 - 0:44:10.200000::of different countries at the same time.
0:44:10.200000 - 0:44:11.200000::Yes.
0:44:11.200000 - 0:44:13.960000::Well, I do feel like I frankly just lost steam.
0:44:13.960000 - 0:44:18.200000::Is this the seven drinks that we had last night where it's just like you could just
0:44:18.200000 - 0:44:19.200000::hit our limit?
0:44:19.200000 - 0:44:22.360000::I feel like we're only so much you guys can ask about.
0:44:22.360000 - 0:44:23.360000::You know what I mean?
0:44:23.360000 - 0:44:25.880000::We're trying so hard.
0:44:25.880000 - 0:44:27.840000::This is top effort.
0:44:27.840000 - 0:44:28.840000::Watch me dig deep right now.
0:44:28.840000 - 0:44:29.840000::Wow.
0:44:29.840000 - 0:44:32.240000::I'm about to re-ignite everything with something amazing.
0:44:32.240000 - 0:44:33.240000::Please, please.
0:44:33.240000 - 0:44:35.240000::Well, guess what?
0:44:35.240000 - 0:44:36.240000::What?
0:44:36.240000 - 0:44:40.240000::I have about six or seven relatives that live right here.
0:44:40.240000 - 0:44:41.240000::Upper west side.
0:44:41.240000 - 0:44:42.240000::Upper west side.
0:44:42.240000 - 0:44:48.720000::And if anybody ever tries to hurt them, let's just say Spider-Man, you saw that right.
0:44:48.720000 - 0:44:50.880000::Well, my shit's going to be a bit crazier.
0:44:50.880000 - 0:44:57.080000::I want to tell everybody right now, we are parked right outside of the American Museum
0:44:57.080000 - 0:44:58.320000::of Natural History.
0:44:58.320000 - 0:44:59.800000::You can pee in there.

0:45:00 - 0:45:04::there and you've seen fucking night at the museum right?
0:45:04 - 0:45:05::No, not like that.
0:45:05 - 0:45:07::You know about that movie right?
0:45:07 - 0:45:08::Stiller.
0:45:08 - 0:45:09::You cannot be serious.
0:45:09 - 0:45:13::That was filmed by Robin Williams on Wilson.
0:45:13 - 0:45:14::Luke Wilson.
0:45:14 - 0:45:15::Luke Wilson.
0:45:15 - 0:45:16::I think, yeah, maybe.
0:45:16 - 0:45:19::Written by, you know, that was written by?
0:45:19 - 0:45:20::Was it written by it?
0:45:20 - 0:45:21::Was his name from the leftovers?
0:45:21 - 0:45:22::Nope.
0:45:22 - 0:45:25::It was written by the Reno 9-1-1 cause.
0:45:25 - 0:45:26::Oh.
0:45:26 - 0:45:27::Every single one of them.
0:45:27 - 0:45:29::And they're not even in it.
0:45:29 - 0:45:30::No, they're not.
0:45:30 - 0:45:31::I don't think so.
0:45:31 - 0:45:32::Holy.
0:45:32 - 0:45:36::By the one with the tight little, the tight little words.
0:45:36 - 0:45:37::Make Swarters.
0:45:37 - 0:45:38::You're talking about Thomas Lennon.
0:45:38 - 0:45:39::Thomas Lennon and Ben.
0:45:39 - 0:45:41::And Ben, which is the top of the dog.
0:45:41 - 0:45:42::Ben Kubrick.
0:45:42 - 0:45:43::Whatever.
0:45:43 - 0:45:44::Two of them.
0:45:44 - 0:45:47::We got some naughty, naughty drivers.
0:45:47 - 0:45:55::Sometimes a car deserves a honk and that was one, but I didn't give it to him.
0:45:55 - 0:45:57::Honk, if you're going through it.
0:45:57 - 0:45:58::How's that for a honk?
0:45:58 - 0:46:01::If life is getting your ass down right now.
0:46:01 - 0:46:05::Honk, if you need jaw surgery and you're not ready yet to take that type of time off of work.
0:46:05 - 0:46:06::Okay.
0:46:06 - 0:46:07::Wow.
0:46:07 - 0:46:08::Yeah.
0:46:08 - 0:46:10::Let's get real honk for everything that everybody's going through.
0:46:10 - 0:46:11::Yeah.
0:46:11 - 0:46:12::And Nate's off the camera again.
0:46:12 - 0:46:13::It might fully.
0:46:13 - 0:46:14::Yeah.
0:46:14 - 0:46:15::It keeps drifting toward you.
0:46:15 - 0:46:16::It's so hot in here, Nate.
0:46:16 - 0:46:18::I don't know how you're wearing that sweater.
0:46:18 - 0:46:19::I know.
0:46:19 - 0:46:20::I don't either.
0:46:20 - 0:46:22::Well, I was wearing a fucking peanut.
0:46:22 - 0:46:23::Other episode.
0:46:23 - 0:46:24::All right.
0:46:24 - 0:46:25::I can't be wearing a V-neck.
0:46:25 - 0:46:26::Like, I'm sorry.
0:46:26 - 0:46:27::I just thought.
0:46:27 - 0:46:28::I'm just saying that I'm a Patron.
0:46:28 - 0:46:29::Patron is.
0:46:29 - 0:46:30::Yeah.
0:46:30 - 0:46:31::What gave everybody joy?
0:46:31 - 0:46:33::I think I'm so glad you said that.
0:46:33 - 0:46:36::What gave my ass joy?
0:46:36 - 0:46:37::Yeah.
0:46:37 - 0:46:38::I'm not kidding.
0:46:38 - 0:46:39::Well, I'll tell you what.
0:46:39 - 0:46:40::You gave me joy.
0:46:40 - 0:46:42::What's that, Nate?
0:46:42 - 0:46:51::Being in this great city of New York fucking city because I haven't been here in maybe a year?
0:46:51 - 0:46:52::No, no, no.
0:46:52 - 0:46:54::I was here in September, I guess.
0:46:54 - 0:46:56::So it's been around six months.
0:46:56 - 0:46:58::Six months it's been since I've been here.
0:46:58 - 0:46:59::Are you kidding me?
0:46:59 - 0:47:00::You were back.
0:47:00 - 0:47:03::That's too long to be away from your spiritual home, New York city.
0:47:03 - 0:47:04::Right.
0:47:04 - 0:47:06::And it's just good to be back.
0:47:06 - 0:47:08::It's good to be.
0:47:08 - 0:47:09::Come back.
0:47:09 - 0:47:12::And yeah, I got to show him May fit.
0:47:12 - 0:47:14::It's 7.30 pm at Union Hall.
0:47:14 - 0:47:15::Gear tickets now.
0:47:15 - 0:47:16::They're going fast.
0:47:16 - 0:47:18::Yeah, I can scoop them up right the fuck now.
0:47:18 - 0:47:19::How are you?
0:47:21 - 0:47:22::You want me to go?
0:47:22 - 0:47:23::Yeah, I'm going to.
0:47:23 - 0:47:24::Here's the deal.
0:47:24 - 0:47:28::I don't like to be joyful about the future because we don't know what it holds.
0:47:28 - 0:47:32::The future is one of the most mysterious things imaginable.
0:47:32 - 0:47:36::People have been wondering what's going to happen in the future for over a hundred years.
0:47:36 - 0:47:39::People were wanting to know what's next, right?
0:47:39 - 0:47:40::Right.
0:47:40 - 0:47:43::Well, I kind of know what's next, in a sense.
0:47:43 - 0:47:48::And I know that we're either getting a bit of ice cream or maybe a bubble tea.
0:47:49 - 0:47:51::I know it's a beautiful day in New York City.
0:47:51 - 0:47:54::Just as God has intended it.
0:47:54 - 0:47:57::Not a cloud in the sky, except for a couple.
0:47:57 - 0:47:59::And I know we're going to ride our bikes around this shit.
0:47:59 - 0:48:03::And not even sweat because it's the silver e-bikes that go all fast.
0:48:03 - 0:48:08::I'm looking at you guys and I'm going to feel lucky that I get to be in New York in this moment too.
0:48:08 - 0:48:15::My best friends after recording one of the most interesting podcasts that's ever been recorded.
0:48:15 - 0:48:18::And it makes me almost cry.
0:48:18 - 0:48:21::So that's what gave me joy.
0:48:21 - 0:48:24::That's what's going to give me joy.
0:48:24 - 0:48:25::Okay.
0:48:25 - 0:48:26::Wow.
0:48:26 - 0:48:27::Okay.
0:48:27 - 0:48:31::And what gave me joy?
0:48:31 - 0:48:32::Yes.
0:48:32 - 0:48:33::Can I see the phone for a second?
0:48:33 - 0:48:34::Yes.
0:48:34 - 0:48:35::Don't.
0:48:35 - 0:48:37::Oh, it's not even plugged in.
0:48:37 - 0:48:40::Oh, this might be low battery, bro.
0:48:40 - 0:48:42::This might be low-ass battery.
0:48:42 - 0:48:44::What gave me joy is you can get a little bit of energy.
0:48:44 - 0:48:46::You can guess it.
0:48:46 - 0:48:48::I'm going out my facial hair.
0:48:48 - 0:48:50::How good is that look?
0:48:50 - 0:48:53::This is about two weeks.
0:48:53 - 0:48:55::Looks pretty good.
0:48:55 - 0:48:59::I'm also using ointments that are helping my acne scars go away very rapidly.
0:48:59 - 0:49:00::I noticed.
0:49:00 - 0:49:01::I noticed.
0:49:01 - 0:49:02::So.
0:49:02 - 0:49:03::That's great.
0:49:03 - 0:49:04::Yeah.
0:49:04 - 0:49:05::My neck's coming in too.
0:49:05 - 0:49:06::Oh, he tried.
0:49:06 - 0:49:07::You were wondering about my neck hair.
0:49:07 - 0:49:13::So every single one of these hairs is like me getting a kiss on the cheek all day long from the sexiest hair.
0:49:13 - 0:49:15::I'm not a sexiest hair follicle in the world.
0:49:15 - 0:49:19::So I get joy from all these thousands of kisses.
0:49:19 - 0:49:22::And I know thousands more to come.
0:49:22 - 0:49:25::And if anybody has any recommendations to get the...
0:49:25 - 0:49:29::These were acne's probably about months and months and months ago.
0:49:29 - 0:49:30::And now they're just red dots.
0:49:30 - 0:49:33::If anyone has any advice, I'm not doing that in great.
0:49:33 - 0:49:35::I'm in my 30s.
0:49:35 - 0:49:37::I'm losing my hair.
0:49:37 - 0:49:39::I got no...
0:49:39 - 0:49:40::No.
0:49:40 - 0:49:42::I would have left it over there.
0:49:42 - 0:49:44::That's joy tactics.
0:49:44 - 0:49:46::Man, man, man, that knows how to do it.
0:49:46 - 0:49:48::Show them the city.
0:49:48 - 0:49:50::That's a mom and her maybe daughter.
0:49:50 - 0:49:52::I have a secret dash cam.
0:49:52 - 0:49:54::I have a secret dash cam.
0:49:54 - 0:49:56::I told you about it.
0:49:56 - 0:49:58::Okay, good bye everybody.
