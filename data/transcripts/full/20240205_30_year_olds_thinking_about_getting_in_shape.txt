0:01:43 - 0:01:45::Different Legos.
0:01:45 - 0:01:50::Well, one time I submitted a Lego creation to Lego Magazine.
0:01:50 - 0:01:55::And I got a, a, a, a, a, a, a member in Lego, me, all member Lego magazine.
0:01:55 - 0:01:58::They would put all, like, kids creations on the back pages.
0:01:58 - 0:02:01::Back two pages were like kids holding up Legos.
0:02:01 - 0:02:03::I made a crazy ass spaceship.
0:02:03 - 0:02:07::And I got confirmation that my Lego was going to be featured in the magazine.
0:02:07 - 0:02:12::And then the bastards did not even ever put one, put my picture in there.
0:02:12 - 0:02:14::Oh, that explains why.
0:02:14 - 0:02:15::Wow.
0:02:15 - 0:02:17::That's an origin story right there.
0:02:17 - 0:02:19::The cry that was not heard.
0:02:19 - 0:02:30::I had a similar scenario where I had, I had worked on a, I, I, do you guys remember this?
0:02:30 - 0:02:31::I don't know.
0:02:31 - 0:02:34::This might be too specific, but it was called Beckett magazine.
0:02:34 - 0:02:37::It was for Dragon Ball Z, like anime.
0:02:37 - 0:02:41::No, it was like a monthly magazine for like anime.
0:02:41 - 0:02:45::And they would have, obviously, they would have the fucking fan art section.
0:02:45 - 0:02:50::And I was, I'm a, I, people don't know this, but I'm an incredible fucking artist and drawer.
0:02:50 - 0:02:53::That was my first passion in life.
0:02:53 - 0:03:00::And I drew the fucking shit out of a Super Saiyan three goat tanks.
0:03:00 - 0:03:02::I think it was one of the fusion.
0:03:02 - 0:03:12::It was like the two little guys, the two little homies fused together in the Super Saiyan three, like the fucking, the most powerful fucking saying you could possibly do.
0:03:12 - 0:03:14::And I was fucking scared.
0:03:14 - 0:03:17::Dude, it looked, I can see it in my head right now.
0:03:17 - 0:03:18::It's so dude.
0:03:18 - 0:03:19::It was perfect.
0:03:19 - 0:03:21::And they said you got it.
0:03:21 - 0:03:22::You're amazing.
0:03:22 - 0:03:24::And then they never hooked it up.
0:03:24 - 0:03:25::No, they didn't.
0:03:25 - 0:03:27::I think I just never sent it in, I think.
0:03:27 - 0:03:33::I forget what went wrong, but it definitely wasn't featured in the magazine.
0:03:33 - 0:03:41::Well, speaking of fusion, fusion superheroes, I was thinking the other day watching the sopranos that
0:03:42 - 0:03:49::Tony soprano is basically joy tactics, joy tactics, SSJ three fusion.
0:03:49 - 0:03:51::Does that feel like what's his name?
0:03:51 - 0:03:54::Tony soprano has Nate kind of face head.
0:03:54 - 0:04:01::James Gandalfini's got Nate's head and face, Eric's not body necessarily, but
0:04:02 - 0:04:09::I was a call it is, just, you know, a lot of people find that body,
0:04:09 - 0:04:11::oh, it's just to believe sexual.
0:04:11 - 0:04:12::He's super hot.
0:04:12 - 0:04:14::I know he's a sex symbol, right?
0:04:14 - 0:04:18::So think twice before you couch the fact that my body looks identical.
0:04:18 - 0:04:20::People are horned up for Tony, dude.
0:04:20 - 0:04:24::People want him fucking, want to ride his ass.
0:04:24 - 0:04:29::The right type of folks love the hell out of it is look.
0:04:29 - 0:04:34::And then I guess he's probably got my clothes or something, but I kind of feel like he's,
0:04:34 - 0:04:36::he reminds me so much of joy tactics.
0:04:36 - 0:04:37::What's that Nate?
0:04:37 - 0:04:38::Is that, oh, is that the drawing?
0:04:38 - 0:04:39::You drew that?
0:04:39 - 0:04:40::Yeah.
0:04:40 - 0:04:41::No way.
0:04:41 - 0:04:42::Oh, Nate.
0:04:42 - 0:04:44::That looks like Tony Cone's got.
0:04:44 - 0:04:46::That looks like Ryan Cabrera.

0:06:08.320000 - 0:06:10.080000::Why do I feel that way and it could be a
0:06:10.080000 - 0:06:16.320000::Relentate some like 75 days even if it was hard. I'd still do it if it for 75 days hard if it was hard
0:06:16.960000 - 0:06:21.240000::So what we're joking about here is a new internet
0:06:21.880000 - 0:06:25.360000::Physical mental challenge called the 75 hard challenge, right?
0:06:26.120000 - 0:06:31.200000::75 days no internet no cell phones going to the gym twice a day eating
0:06:31.680000 - 0:06:33.440000::one
0:06:33.520000 - 0:06:35.200000::type of meal
0:06:35.200000 - 0:06:41.240000::For 75 days one type of meat one type of meat one type of vegetable and then at the end of the 75 days
0:06:41.240000 - 0:06:43.240000::I don't know what happens
0:06:44.200000 - 0:06:46.200000::To be honest, saying what you look like
0:06:46.200000 - 0:06:49.600000::I think out of the three of us
0:06:49.960000 - 0:06:54.680000::Okay, so let's really break down what 75 it hard is this a new thing by the way like no
0:06:55 - 0:06:58.440000::It's maybe like a four-year-old tiktok kind of like okay
0:07:00 - 0:07:03.760000::75 hard is not for the week of heart. We'll just put it that way
0:07:04.600000 - 0:07:10.920000::It's 75 days no slip ups if you slip up you restart do you all realize this?
0:07:10.920000 - 0:07:12.920000::Oh
0:07:12.920000 - 0:07:16.440000::That's how you do it. Oh, so the hardest thing to do would be the 69
0:07:17.200000 - 0:07:19.440000::Hard one easy 69 hard one easy
0:07:20.120000 - 0:07:23.680000::69 74 is what I meant. Why do I think that was one less?
0:07:24.200000 - 0:07:30.480000::You would be I didn't even fool I didn't mean to say 69 like a it wasn't like a joke number
0:07:30.480000 - 0:07:32.480000::I just thought that was one less than 75
0:07:34.320000 - 0:07:37.140000::That's math it mathematically concerning jack
0:07:40.920000 - 0:07:47.180000::All twisted up. What is it? It's no drinking eating clean choose a diet plan of your choice
0:07:47.180000 - 0:07:56.080000::But you cannot stray no cheating or else you restart read 10 pages of an of self-development nonfiction if you miss one page restart
0:07:56.400000 - 0:08:04.520000::Yeah, working out twice a day 45 minutes outside 45 minutes at the gym if you accidentally do this second workout inside by the way
0:08:04.920000 - 0:08:07.600000::Restart restart and harm yourself
0:08:10.920000 - 0:08:12.920000::It's pro self-harm right?
0:08:13.320000 - 0:08:15.320000::That's right by the way
0:08:15.320000 - 0:08:17.320000::Just speaking out loud
0:08:17.520000 - 0:08:19.520000::No speaking out loud it's 75 days
0:08:20.600000 - 0:08:27::Stick to the diet take progress pictures every day and by the way that doesn't mean because it's a physical
0:08:27 - 0:08:33.600000::Intermental challenge too. So how do you take a mental progress picture? You play a sport or you play a quiz like that
0:08:33.600000 - 0:08:40.480000::You see how fast you can type all 50 states every day. I do think out of the three of us if I did this challenge
0:08:40.480000 - 0:08:42.480000::It would be life changing
0:08:42.880000 - 0:08:47::Well, I sure the urgency would like me like that though
0:08:47.240000 - 0:08:52.800000::You logged on to the zoom and kind of immediately started begging us to please do this challenge with you and
0:08:54.320000 - 0:09:01.040000::My word it might it might it might be time. What if we did what's what if we did a 75 hard?
0:09:01.200000 - 0:09:03.520000::That was catered to each of our needs
0:09:04.120000 - 0:09:07.880000::Right so what do I need I probably need?
0:09:08.160000 - 0:09:15.920000::None of the physical stuff because I'm a specimen essentially and then I need all the reading stuff because well you guys have seen how I behave and speak
0:09:16.160000 - 0:09:20::So maybe for me it's 75 pages every day of reading
0:09:20.760000 - 0:09:25.680000::Wow, it has to be outdoor reading 45 pages inside 45 pages outside
0:09:25.680000 - 0:09:27.680000::I

0:09:36.320000 - 0:09:42.920000::Yeah, the pretzel dog. Let me go to any ends. I feel like there's too much wiggle room with this

0:10:00 - 0:10:04.800000::If I should not make sure I got you came up with 75 hard. Yeah, I don't think you'd be saying that shit
0:10:05.840000 - 0:10:10.720000::This is a real one and let me get a sleep with the hostage tape on his mouth. You know that oh
0:10:11.400000 - 0:10:16.040000::You need hostage tape Nate when he sleeps you know hostage tape is
0:10:16.600000 - 0:10:18.800000::Now just keep it keep your mouth from
0:10:19.520000 - 0:10:21.520000::Breathing and opening during the night
0:10:22.480000 - 0:10:28.160000::Yeah, yeah, I got a little something I want to show you right you got the breathe right in the hostage
0:10:28.160000 - 0:10:31.300000::Let me show you something right here my man. Yeah
0:10:32.240000 - 0:10:34.240000::Yeah, no exactly what you talking about
0:10:34.240000 - 0:10:37.840000::That's not that doesn't look like hostage tape that looks like regular ass tape
0:10:38.800000 - 0:10:40.800000::Wait, what oh
0:10:40.800000 - 0:10:42.800000::Shit
0:10:42.800000 - 0:10:44.800000::Like using Scotch tape
0:10:45.200000 - 0:10:47.200000::I can't really really around mouth
0:10:48.120000 - 0:10:55.160000::No, I'm one of those fucking dumbasses who puts a mouth tape on and the note I look like a psychopath when I sleep
0:10:55.160000 - 0:10:58.920000::Like I have us up the mouth tape on because I'm like really bad at
0:11:00.360000 - 0:11:03::Breathing through my mouth. We got to get your ass
0:11:04.120000 - 0:11:08.600000::A CPAP or they have those fancy ass breathe-right things that are reusable
0:11:09.560000 - 0:11:13.160000::We've seen those and it like rarely opens the fuck out of your nostrils to where it hurts
0:11:13.720000 - 0:11:16.640000::They're like open so bad hard that it's like torture almost
0:11:18.200000 - 0:11:23.720000::Where you fools are messing up this kind of reminds me of like the 30s before people knew the exercise was good for you
0:11:24.200000 - 0:11:29.240000::Because right now what I'm doing is when I sleep is I put a fucking swimming nose clip on my nose
0:11:29.240000 - 0:11:34.840000::So I can't breathe through my nose and I put the dentist thing in my mouth. So my mouth is all the way stressed open all night
0:11:38.280000 - 0:11:43.480000::And I put I you know I open my ears as hard as I can I keep my eyes what
0:11:44.760000 - 0:11:46.760000::Taped open tape my eyes open
0:11:47.720000 - 0:11:51.160000::Because that's damn your body gets the sleep it needs
0:11:52.120000 - 0:11:54.440000::Under those circumstances, you know what I'm saying?
0:11:54.920000 - 0:11:57.320000::You only get the sleep that your body your body is
0:11:58.360000 - 0:12:03.720000::forcing itself to be deeply sleeping in that scenario because the easier you make it for you
0:12:03.720000 - 0:12:05.080000::You're basically
0:12:05.160000 - 0:12:09.400000::You're tricking your body into thinking it's already sleeping all put on an eye mask
0:12:09.400000 - 0:12:12.040000::I'm asleep. I'll put on wind noise. I'm asleep
0:12:12.520000 - 0:12:16.280000::You're not man and your body's not recovering as it should be when it's really
0:12:16.920000 - 0:12:21.240000::Past out basically choked out through its sensory organizational patterns
0:12:21.960000 - 0:12:23.480000::Course
0:12:23.480000 - 0:12:28.200000::So let's get into what everybody 75 hard is going to be Eric. You're just going to be 75 hard
0:12:28.680000 - 0:12:31.640000::Normal except maybe we'll include something
0:12:33.560000 - 0:12:40.520000::Something with a CPAP you know, what is the most challenging part of the 75 hard to you because it seems like it doesn't seem that
0:12:40.600000 - 0:12:42.600000::Difficult to me like is this
0:12:42.840000 - 0:12:46.840000::What is the part that you think would change your life because you're already working out. I feel like
0:12:48.040000 - 0:12:50.040000::Very regularly found daily
0:12:50.360000 - 0:12:54.360000::Yeah, but I'm mostly just hitting the weights and getting kind of the easy cardio in
0:12:55.400000 - 0:12:59.320000::So I think that if I was you know it would change your life
0:13:00.120000 - 0:13:03.960000::What just do the part where you take a progress picture every day
0:13:04.440000 - 0:13:07.160000::I didn't change anything about my life, but I did take a picture
0:13:07.800000 - 0:13:11.240000::That might be a game changer to have to look to look at myself every day
0:13:11.480000 - 0:13:15.720000::And just for photography you know like on day one I was using my phone by the end
0:13:15.720000 - 0:13:18.840000::I was using like a hot spot film 70 millimeter rebel
0:13:19.480000 - 0:13:25.880000::Now making new f stops you'd never heard of and getting light like oh there's nothing I like more than f stops
0:13:26.760000 - 0:13:30.680000::Oh, right. I wish the f's would never stop. I wish they would go keep going
0:13:31.800000 - 0:13:32.600000::Tee hee hee hee
0:13:33.400000 - 0:13:40.840000::Let's see hardest part of 75. Listen. I'm someone who likes to reward myself. I need to stop giving myself treats
0:13:41.480000 - 0:13:47.880000::As if I'm a dog, you know, I'm saying I need to right. I need to dope a mean restrict so intensely
0:13:47.880000 - 0:13:50.600000::I'm so happy every almost every second of the day
0:13:50.680000 - 0:13:53.960000::You know, I'll go through stuff that you guys have heard of that would break most people
0:13:53.960000 - 0:13:57.400000::But I walk around with a smile on the face of my face most at the time
0:13:57.640000 - 0:14:02.600000::All it takes is me seeing a friend and I and I'm good to go all it takes is a meal out in a martini
0:14:02.680000 - 0:14:08.520000::And I forget the pain that that guy put on me that day if I didn't have those little safety blankets though
0:14:09.320000 - 0:14:13.640000::You would see a different side of me for sure that we probably wouldn't like
0:14:14.360000 - 0:14:16.360000::But maybe he needs to come out
0:14:17.160000 - 0:14:19.160000::Uh-oh you want to take a quiz on me
0:14:24.920000 - 0:14:27.880000::Oh, the voice just kind of high. I think that was it
0:14:30.360000 - 0:14:32.360000::Your mid-like crisis is just being
0:14:32.680000 - 0:14:34.680000::being Lonnie
0:14:35.560000 - 0:14:39.400000::So here let me take a quiz. I'll give you a quiz rather
0:14:40.360000 - 0:14:43.080000::I'm going to ask you to look at my face
0:14:43.960000 - 0:14:45.400000::And I'm going to ask a simple question
0:14:46.120000 - 0:14:49.320000::Which one of these is depression ready?
0:14:50.520000 - 0:14:52.520000::Hmm
0:14:57.720000 - 0:14:59.560000::You're looking kind of sexy when you're out

0:15:00 - 0:15:04.800000::Well, that's right because that's not the depressed one.
0:15:04.800000 - 0:15:06.120000::The depressed one is this one.
0:15:06.120000 - 0:15:08.080000::A happy face is depression.
0:15:08.080000 - 0:15:09.080000::Now what the hell?
0:15:09.080000 - 0:15:10.240000::That's crazy.
0:15:10.240000 - 0:15:16.480000::I'm hiding so much tension in my cheeks, this and that.
0:15:16.480000 - 0:15:19.840000::Can I tell you guys, I don't feel like I've been depressed in so long.
0:15:19.840000 - 0:15:24.280000::I'm almost sad to admit that I don't feel depression like that.
0:15:24.280000 - 0:15:29.560000::Yeah, in the beginning of this, you were given a speech about how things weren't going
0:15:29.560000 - 0:15:30.560000::that well.
0:15:30.560000 - 0:15:31.960000::I feel like you needed to make a change.
0:15:31.960000 - 0:15:34.680000::What do you mean by you haven't been depressed?
0:15:34.680000 - 0:15:37.520000::You know what I'm saying?
0:15:37.520000 - 0:15:40.720000::My life is, I kind of alluded to this about two minutes ago.
0:15:40.720000 - 0:15:44.760000::My life is falling apart, but I'm doing it with kind of happy about it.
0:15:44.760000 - 0:15:45.760000::We're happy about it.
0:15:45.760000 - 0:15:46.760000::Okay.
0:15:46.760000 - 0:15:47.760000::You're taking the room.
0:15:47.760000 - 0:15:49.560000::I have a good relationship with existence right now.
0:15:49.560000 - 0:15:50.560000::Right.
0:15:50.560000 - 0:15:52.640000::You're ripping the screen off and saying, you should be very afraid, Eric.
0:15:52.640000 - 0:15:53.640000::You should be very afraid.
0:15:53.640000 - 0:15:55.640000::I know I should, but I can't feel fear anymore.
0:15:55.640000 - 0:16:02.640000::I was on a plane recently that was almost literally inverted flying.
0:16:02.640000 - 0:16:05.880000::And I just thought like, yo, who cares?
0:16:05.880000 - 0:16:07.640000::Who fucking cares?
0:16:07.640000 - 0:16:08.640000::Right.
0:16:08.640000 - 0:16:09.640000::Well, you look at how big I was.
0:16:09.640000 - 0:16:14.720000::I recently knew type of philosophy that would disturb most, but I'm so okay with whoever's
0:16:14.720000 - 0:16:19.200000::pulling the strings, whoever's behind the invisible glass and they're looking down on
0:16:19.200000 - 0:16:23.280000::us and orchestrating our lives and making it happen.
0:16:23.280000 - 0:16:28.480000::I've just, I've accepted it and whatever happens happens and that's either like violent
0:16:28.480000 - 0:16:31.760000::depression or like the most highest like spiritual.
0:16:31.760000 - 0:16:33.400000::I think I pushed through the wild.
0:16:33.400000 - 0:16:34.560000::I don't know where you're at.
0:16:34.560000 - 0:16:38.440000::You could be on either side of it where you're just surrendering to this would scare
0:16:38.440000 - 0:16:40.440000::most men and men.
0:16:40.440000 - 0:16:46.680000::Well, there's something called when you, what is it?
0:16:46.680000 - 0:16:48.800000::Let go of all desires.
0:16:48.800000 - 0:16:50.800000::I'd definitely have one man.
0:16:50.800000 - 0:16:56.960000::I just made a philosophy out of it yet, but when you're able to let go of the desire,
0:16:56.960000 - 0:17:02.240000::that's when you stop wanting things because wanting is the source of suffering.
0:17:02.240000 - 0:17:07.320000::That's why when I open seamless every night, I say, whatever, you know, I just memo it.
0:17:07.320000 - 0:17:10.280000::I say, here's 15 bucks to the restaurant.
0:17:10.280000 - 0:17:12.360000::By the way, I only eat at restaurants.
0:17:12.360000 - 0:17:15.640000::I memo them 15 bucks.
0:17:15.640000 - 0:17:16.640000::No more.
0:17:16.640000 - 0:17:20.240000::I say chef's special, please.
0:17:20.240000 - 0:17:22.240000::I think it's Jack again.
0:17:22.240000 - 0:17:23.480000::Y'all know where I live at.
0:17:23.480000 - 0:17:25.040000::Come in by the way.
0:17:25.040000 - 0:17:26.720000::Don't just drop the food off.
0:17:26.720000 - 0:17:27.720000::Come upstairs.
0:17:27.720000 - 0:17:29.560000::Sit down with me.
0:17:29.560000 - 0:17:31.080000::Meet my cat.
0:17:31.080000 - 0:17:32.680000::Meet my girlfriend.
0:17:32.680000 - 0:17:34.680000::See my clothes.
0:17:34.680000 - 0:17:40.720000::Why has culture gotten rid of everything that once was amazing?
0:17:40.720000 - 0:17:43.320000::That's something I can't explain.
0:17:43.320000 - 0:17:46.800000::Well, no one's been able to explain my lines of reasoning for years.
0:17:46.800000 - 0:17:51.880000::So you're saying desire, participating in desire actually gives you the opposite effect.
0:17:51.880000 - 0:17:52.880000::Right.
0:17:52.880000 - 0:17:53.880000::Right.
0:17:53.880000 - 0:17:56.400000::So if I desire something, actually, I won't get it.
0:17:56.400000 - 0:18:00.120000::Imagine you want to poke in the sudden, do I not want to be in the next Jedi Battalion
0:18:00.120000 - 0:18:01.120000::joint?
0:18:01.120000 - 0:18:03.920000::Because, do you know what I'm saying?
0:18:03.920000 - 0:18:06.720000::Well, what was that long island, King of Long Island movie?
0:18:06.720000 - 0:18:07.720000::Right.
0:18:07.720000 - 0:18:10.120000::They wanted my ass badly for that.
0:18:10.120000 - 0:18:13.880000::Well, they want the prince of, they want the prince of Ridgewood.
0:18:13.880000 - 0:18:14.880000::Yeah.
0:18:14.880000 - 0:18:16.880000::The prince of Ridgewood.
0:18:16.880000 - 0:18:18.720000::Oh, that's a fucking.
0:18:18.720000 - 0:18:19.720000::They tried to make me king.
0:18:19.720000 - 0:18:21.800000::I said, don't do that to me.
0:18:21.800000 - 0:18:26.560000::Don't give me that power like Gladriel from the Lurtherings when she tries to ring on
0:18:26.560000 - 0:18:30.600000::and she's like, don't give me the.
0:18:30.600000 - 0:18:32.400000::Remember that scene?
0:18:32.400000 - 0:18:33.800000::Yeah, he was Gladriel.
0:18:33.800000 - 0:18:39.280000::Gladriel, the elf, the high elf that like, you know, the lore, you know that, you know
0:18:39.280000 - 0:18:44.440000::that elf and Frodo's like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
0:18:44.480000 - 0:18:48.720000::I know some high elves, some different types of high elves, those mine people.
0:18:48.720000 - 0:18:50.720000::I don't know these in middle earth types.
0:18:50.720000 - 0:18:52.280000::You're talking about the fractal elves.
0:18:52.280000 - 0:18:56.520000::Well, can you imagine what you know them, but I know them by their first names.
0:18:56.520000 - 0:19:00.120000::Can you imagine getting your bike blown out by the fractal elves?
0:19:00.120000 - 0:19:05.200000::Just going and going on the big old fractal.
0:19:05.200000 - 0:19:08.560000::But on the big old DMP trip, the most fun and crazy, blown out thing.
0:19:08.560000 - 0:19:11.800000::DMP experience.
0:19:11.800000 - 0:19:17.160000::If you were doing a trip, trip sitting for your friend and they started just, zzzz,
0:19:17.160000 - 0:19:18.440000::not in the middle of a place.

0:19:27.280000 - 0:19:28.280000::Sign my ass up.
0:19:28.280000 - 0:19:30.080000::Get all sloppy with it, man.

0:20:00 - 0:20:00.840000::I'm not gonna say it.
0:20:00.840000 - 0:20:01.660000::I was.
0:20:01.660000 - 0:20:02.500000::Yeah.

0:28:37.200000 - 0:28:38.200000::That's crazy.
0:28:38.200000 - 0:28:39.280000::It sounds like, you know, 2001 Space Odyssey mixed
0:28:39.280000 - 0:28:42.880000::with stranded on the island movie with John Wilson.
0:28:42.880000 - 0:28:43.720000::Cast away?
0:28:43.720000 - 0:28:44.720000::No, John Wilson.
0:28:44.720000 - 0:28:45.720000::Cast away.
0:28:45.720000 - 0:28:46.720000::Yeah.
0:28:46.720000 - 0:28:47.720000::With John Wilson.
0:28:47.720000 - 0:28:48.720000::The Wilson.
0:28:48.720000 - 0:28:49.720000::The Wilson.
0:28:49.720000 - 0:28:50.720000::We need to put John Wilson,

0:28:54.040000 - 0:28:55.480000::Oh, that would be sick.
0:28:55.480000 - 0:28:57.800000::You know, like monkey is doing.
0:28:57.800000 - 0:28:59.320000::John Wilson Safari.
0:28:59.320000 - 0:29:01.160000::Like fucking weird shit, you know.
0:29:01.160000 - 0:29:02.160000::John Wilson.
0:29:02.160000 - 0:29:03.160000::That would be tight.
0:29:03.160000 - 0:29:05.720000::John Wilson takes Mount Kilimanjaro bare naked.
0:29:05.720000 - 0:29:09.080000::They go on a safari in the new love on the spectrum.
0:29:09.080000 - 0:29:10.080000::I love that.

0:29:11.080000 - 0:29:12.080000::I've been watching you.
0:29:12.080000 - 0:29:13.080000::I've been watching you.
0:29:13.080000 - 0:29:14.080000::I love that show.
0:29:14.080000 - 0:29:16.600000::When she said, she looks at the spoiler alert,
0:29:16.600000 - 0:29:18.240000::funny lines, spoiler alert.
0:29:18.240000 - 0:29:19.480000::She's looking at a gazelle,
0:29:19.480000 - 0:29:21.800000::get eaten by a bunch of coyotes or whatever's out there.
0:29:21.800000 - 0:29:23.360000::Yeah, when she said it.
0:29:23.360000 - 0:29:26.080000::And she looks at the dead gazelles corpse and goes,
0:29:26.080000 - 0:29:28.080000::hmm, that'll never be me.
0:29:28.080000 - 0:29:30.600000::I'll have to be.
0:29:30.600000 - 0:29:32.840000::She might be a much of a me.
0:29:32.840000 - 0:29:33.840000::Abby's my fave.
0:29:33.840000 - 0:29:35.960000::Oh, you know, guess who my favorite is.
0:29:35.960000 - 0:29:36.960000::You like Danny?
0:29:36.960000 - 0:29:38.680000::Danny is kind of like,
0:29:38.680000 - 0:29:39.680000::you know what I'm saying?
0:29:39.680000 - 0:29:40.680000::I'm like, you know what I'm saying?
0:29:40.680000 - 0:29:42.680000::But Danny's gonna be a Connorhead.
0:29:42.680000 - 0:29:45::Yeah, she's shallow, dude.
0:29:45 - 0:29:46.800000::She just wants to fucking.
0:29:46.800000 - 0:29:48.640000::If they don't have an animation studio,
0:29:48.640000 - 0:29:49.640000::it's a lights out.
0:29:49.640000 - 0:29:50.640000::It's lights out.
0:29:50.640000 - 0:29:52.480000::Like the fucking six pack.
0:29:52.480000 - 0:29:56.160000::Yeah, but no animation studio.
0:29:56.160000 - 0:29:58.200000::She's turning down the,
0:29:58.200000 - 0:30:00::I do love her the one that she's.

0:30:00 - 0:30:04.720000::He's like the Adon, the guy, the final man that she's with.
0:30:04.720000 - 0:30:06.440000::Oh, I haven't gotten to her Adon.
0:30:06.440000 - 0:30:08.760000::Oh, dude, you're gonna fucking lose it, man.
0:30:08.760000 - 0:30:10.800000::This dude is a fucking P.I.M.P.
0:30:10.800000 - 0:30:12.520000::He's got the craziest rid of her, and he...
0:30:12.520000 - 0:30:13.520000::I don't know.
0:30:13.520000 - 0:30:15.720000::She picked it, and they, well, I'm gonna spoil it.
0:30:15.720000 - 0:30:17.680000::They find love.
0:30:17.680000 - 0:30:18.820000::Oh.
0:30:18.820000 - 0:30:22.840000::But my favorite is fucking, that needs his own spin off.
0:30:22.840000 - 0:30:25::I'm talking about, I want the whole show to be this,
0:30:25 - 0:30:27.640000::is James and his father.
0:30:27.640000 - 0:30:29.160000::Who's James?
0:30:29.160000 - 0:30:31.360000::The game just, the guy was like, oh!
0:30:31.360000 - 0:30:32.560000::He has the kind of guy.
0:30:32.560000 - 0:30:33.440000::Oh, that guy.
0:30:33.440000 - 0:30:36.040000::He has the...
0:30:36.040000 - 0:30:37.160000::He's like from Boston.
0:30:37.160000 - 0:30:39::He has the older parents, kind of.
0:30:39 - 0:30:39.920000::Yeah, yeah.
0:30:39.920000 - 0:30:41.480000::Yeah, I like his ass.
0:30:41.480000 - 0:30:42.480000::Is that the guy who made me feel it?
0:30:42.480000 - 0:30:43.320000::My favorite.
0:30:43.320000 - 0:30:45.760000::I like, I like love one this picture, my Australia.
0:30:45.760000 - 0:30:47.840000::Have you seen that one?
0:30:47.840000 - 0:30:48.840000::No.
0:30:48.840000 - 0:30:50.280000::I think I have.
0:30:50.280000 - 0:30:52.280000::There's one guy on that one, I forget his name,
0:30:52.280000 - 0:30:55.360000::who's just like, I want to chill with him so bad.
0:30:55.360000 - 0:30:57.880000::He's like, so, he's a real gentleman.
0:31:00.160000 - 0:31:06.160000::And so, I have a brother, I'm not going to talk about it.
0:31:06.160000 - 0:31:08.160000::Say it again on.
0:31:08.160000 - 0:31:10.160000::Say it again on.
0:31:10.160000 - 0:31:11.160000::Okay.
0:31:11.160000 - 0:31:19.160000::But, I'll just say, I will just say that, yeah.
0:31:19.160000 - 0:31:23.160000::I got my mom to watch the show, and she thought it was a little hard to watch.
0:31:23.160000 - 0:31:25.160000::I get it.
0:31:25.160000 - 0:31:27.160000::There's mixed emotions going on while you're watching it,
0:31:27.160000 - 0:31:28.160000::because it feels exploitative.
0:31:29.160000 - 0:31:30.160000::It's also entertaining.
0:31:30.160000 - 0:31:36.160000::I feel like it's like, are we going to look back on this in 20 years and be like, damn,
0:31:36.160000 - 0:31:39::I can't believe that they were making.
0:31:39 - 0:31:44.960000::Is it like, well, we will be, because once the autistic people take over the world,
0:31:44.960000 - 0:31:50.160000::because they're doing it rapidly, as we see with Elon Musk and everybody, they'll be saying,
0:31:50.160000 - 0:31:51.160000::you like that.
0:31:51.160000 - 0:31:52.160000::It showed in you.
0:31:52.160000 - 0:31:53.160000::It's really funny, right?
0:31:53.160000 - 0:31:54.160000::I was going to make you fucking eat.
0:31:54.160000 - 0:31:56.160000::You're going to be fucking DVDs of it.
0:31:56.160000 - 0:31:57.160000::Yeah.
0:31:57.160000 - 0:32:03.160000::I pray to God, those producers here are behaving themselves and not, you know what I'm saying?
0:32:03.160000 - 0:32:04.160000::Well, here's the tales.
0:32:04.160000 - 0:32:07.160000::Something tells me they're not, something tells me that.
0:32:07.160000 - 0:32:10.160000::Something tells me they're orchestrating it, making them a certain way.
0:32:10.160000 - 0:32:13.160000::Something tells me that they, I'm not going to say that there's even a pot,
0:32:13.160000 - 0:32:16.160000::I'm not saying, you literally, it wouldn't be even right to say this,
0:32:16.160000 - 0:32:21.160000::but I'm not saying that they caused these diseases in these people from the birth,
0:32:21.160000 - 0:32:25.160000::and they were planted birth inside the bowels of Paramount Studios,
0:32:25.160000 - 0:32:27.160000::and these aren't even real individuals you know what I'm saying?
0:32:27.160000 - 0:32:28.160000::Oh.
0:32:28.160000 - 0:32:31.160000::There's a larger conspiracy here, perhaps, to discover.
0:32:31.160000 - 0:32:33.160000::You're taking it too far, man.
0:32:33.160000 - 0:32:36.160000::I'm just talking, I'm not saying, I agree with you.
0:32:36.160000 - 0:32:38.160000::That's why I'm not saying that, but I'm just talking to you.
0:32:38.160000 - 0:32:43.160000::You know who my favorite, actually, my new favorite is, is the guy who's like so poetic
0:32:43.160000 - 0:32:48.160000::and collect swords, and he goes to the speed date, and he likes the girl that he knows from
0:32:48.160000 - 0:32:52.160000::Kroger, and he goes outside, and he's like, this isn't love.
0:32:52.160000 - 0:32:53.160000::Yeah, yeah, yeah.
0:32:53.160000 - 0:32:57.160000::It's just like he's so, oh, he's so good.
0:32:57.160000 - 0:32:59.160000::Now that's what makes you wonder.
0:32:59.160000 - 0:33:00.160000::Yeah.
0:33:00.160000 - 0:33:04.160000::That's what makes you wonder, because there's that moment where he's on the speed date,
0:33:04.160000 - 0:33:07.160000::and we're all laughing because he's writing right in front of the person,
0:33:07.160000 - 0:33:08.160000::oh, right.
0:33:08.160000 - 0:33:09.160000::He's writing, no, I don't like that.
0:33:09.160000 - 0:33:10.160000::Yes, I know.
0:33:10.160000 - 0:33:17.160000::Cutting in, and we are laughing at him for doing that.
0:33:17.160000 - 0:33:18.160000::Right.
0:33:19.160000 - 0:33:27.160000::And that's like, is it okay to laugh at Nate when he does, you know what I'm saying?
0:33:27.160000 - 0:33:31.160000::When he puts the, like, he's an epicodon on apocryst.
0:33:31.160000 - 0:33:35.160000::Or he's an epicoceno doing meditation with a breeze, a breeze-right.
0:33:35.160000 - 0:33:36.160000::Right.
0:33:36.160000 - 0:33:41.160000::Me and Eric, we're kind of similar, a scenario.
0:33:41.160000 - 0:33:45.160000::Is it ethical to have Nate on a podcast as a host?
0:33:45.160000 - 0:33:51.160000::Can I tell you guys, just like, no, not right now.
0:33:51.160000 - 0:33:54.160000::Is it possible to get this thing from someone like Nate?
0:33:54.160000 - 0:33:55.160000::Yeah.
0:33:55.160000 - 0:33:57.160000::I was going to say about, I want to tell you guys about Abusted.
0:33:57.160000 - 0:34:00.160000::No, I, no, I'm not going to talk about this.
0:34:00.160000 - 0:34:02.160000::You have to say it would be fun.
0:34:02.160000 - 0:34:08.160000::Okay, I was in, I was trying to get a, like, a really, but like, I'm fucking meditating twice a day, right?
0:34:08.160000 - 0:34:10.160000::No, no, not negotiable, all right.
0:34:10.160000 - 0:34:17.160000::So sometimes when you're out and about, like, me and you have this crazy lifestyle where you're, you know, you're going places constantly.
0:34:17.160000 - 0:34:20.160000::Sometimes you're not going to have to meditate in a casino.
0:34:20.160000 - 0:34:21.160000::That's right.
0:34:21.160000 - 0:34:23.160000::Sometimes you're not going to have to meditate in a car, all right?
0:34:23.160000 - 0:34:28.160000::You can't always have the, you can't always have the fucking sanctuary of your meditation.
0:34:28.160000 - 0:34:33.160000::You know, I have a whole room dedicated to meditation and other things.
0:34:33.160000 - 0:34:34.160000::Right.
0:34:34.160000 - 0:34:41.160000::But I was, I had to meditate in the library.
0:34:41.160000 - 0:34:45.160000::And I was, I was getting some work done.
0:34:45.160000 - 0:34:50.160000::I was actually editing the podcast and in the library.
0:34:50.160000 - 0:34:55.160000::And there was a individual.
0:34:55.160000 - 0:35:00.160000::I won't say if he was unhoused or not, but I would assume.

0:35:00 - 0:35:03.920000::So, and I was in the librarian.
0:35:03.920000 - 0:35:06.600000::And he seemed like something was going on with him.
0:35:06.600000 - 0:35:08.320000::All right, that's all I'm gonna say.
0:35:08.320000 - 0:35:12.800000::And my shit was plugged into the outlet.
0:35:12.800000 - 0:35:15.600000::And if my computer gets unplugged,
0:35:15.600000 - 0:35:18.480000::it stops the export.
0:35:18.480000 - 0:35:21.200000::Okay, I don't know if you're familiar with this Jack,
0:35:21.200000 - 0:35:22.360000::you're an editor.
0:35:22.360000 - 0:35:24.520000::I don't know if it's maybe my busted computer,
0:35:24.520000 - 0:35:26.120000::but it's your computer.
0:35:26.120000 - 0:35:27.360000::It's my computer for sure.
0:35:27.360000 - 0:35:31.800000::So if the source gets unplugged, it stops the whole thing.
0:35:31.800000 - 0:35:35.320000::So it was like, I was like 35 minutes into the export.
0:35:35.320000 - 0:35:37.600000::It takes a long time for my computer to do this.
0:35:37.600000 - 0:35:39.080000::And then I would have to start all over.
0:35:39.080000 - 0:35:44.080000::So I was like, this guy comes up and he,
0:35:44.760000 - 0:35:47.160000::and I'm like kind of peeking out as I'm meditating,
0:35:47.160000 - 0:35:48.600000::like with my eye.
0:35:48.600000 - 0:35:52.200000::And I'm seeing him put like this gigantic plug
0:35:52.200000 - 0:35:56.120000::into the outlet of like where my shit's plugged into.
0:35:56.120000 - 0:35:58.200000::And I'm like, oh my God, please don't.
0:35:59.280000 - 0:36:04.280000::And he's plugging into that like 17 different things.
0:36:04.280000 - 0:36:07.720000::Like it prongs out into like he's charging like phones
0:36:07.720000 - 0:36:10.560000::and fucking iPads, everything he owns,
0:36:10.560000 - 0:36:12.200000::he's charging through this.
0:36:12.200000 - 0:36:15.040000::And it like short circuits the whole fucking thing.

0:43:45.760000 - 0:43:50.840000::Alcohol is not hitting the same way that it has in my life
0:43:50.840000 - 0:43:57.640000::I think I'm saying the 30s I've hit the 30s hump tour. I just it has to be special occasion style
0:43:58.240000 - 0:44:03.280000::You know I'm saying you're talking about kidney disease and liver failure. That's right
0:44:03.280000 - 0:44:10.200000::I think we are basing as a culture drinking habits on our people with Irish bodies
0:44:10.760000 - 0:44:16.520000::Right, which people have people with Russian bodies with with them Irish bodies
0:44:16.920000 - 0:44:24.920000::The Irish body types. Yeah, they can fucking go to the pub every night and drink Guinness and drink fucking smittics
0:44:25.640000 - 0:44:27.640000::All right, even need houses
0:44:27.640000 - 0:44:32.520000::People can just walk they don't even sleep. Right. It's walking walk and walk and drinking walking
0:44:33.560000 - 0:44:36.040000::But it's so romantic drinking can be so romantic
0:44:36.520000 - 0:44:38.520000::Ha
0:44:39.480000 - 0:44:41.480000::Right like my
0:44:41.480000 - 0:44:46.120000::My idea of the best times hitting a sauna basically blackout drunk with my friends
0:44:47.720000 - 0:44:52.920000::That's about and that is but may is basically one of the most dangerous sounding things you can do now that I think about it
0:44:53.560000 - 0:44:58.120000::Get in body of vodka and tall Russian beers and then hitting the 190 degrees sauna
0:44:59.080000 - 0:45:01.080000::But it's the most likely

0:45:00 - 0:45:01.440000::out in a hot room.
0:45:02.440000 - 0:45:05.240000::Are you guys hitting the steam room ever?
0:45:05.240000 - 0:45:07.120000::I'm afraid of the steam room at my gym
0:45:07.120000 - 0:45:10.520000::because I think it might contain Legionnaire's disease.
0:45:10.520000 - 0:45:14.040000::There's something unsanitary about the steam room to me.
0:45:14.040000 - 0:45:14.880000::Yeah.
0:45:14.880000 - 0:45:16.360000::It's the wet.
0:45:16.360000 - 0:45:17.800000::It's wet, right?
0:45:17.800000 - 0:45:21.200000::I was just at that sauna outside Montreal.
0:45:21.200000 - 0:45:23.680000::I got in the steam room and there were two teen guys
0:45:23.680000 - 0:45:27.160000::just coughing up a fucking lung in the steam room.
0:45:27.160000 - 0:45:32.360000::And I just knew that the germs can hop like, you know,
0:45:32.360000 - 0:45:36.200000::and plus the meat over to my mouth.
0:45:36.200000 - 0:45:37.480000::Big hits.
0:45:37.480000 - 0:45:40.520000::Get right down my throat.
0:45:40.520000 - 0:45:41.040000::Yeah.
0:45:41.040000 - 0:45:43.920000::So you're basically as underwater as you can get
0:45:43.920000 - 0:45:45.240000::while still breathing.
0:45:45.240000 - 0:45:46.240000::That's interesting.
0:45:46.240000 - 0:45:50::But this steam feels so nice, don't it?

0:47:31.360000 - 0:47:34.840000::I think it was the blue one, but I put it up to the counter
0:47:34.840000 - 0:47:38.720000::and the guy at the gas station was like,
0:47:38.720000 - 0:47:41.520000::this is going to keep you up all night, bro.
0:47:41.520000 - 0:47:42.520000::But there's no caffeine in there.
0:47:42.520000 - 0:47:43.400000::And I was like, what?
0:47:43.400000 - 0:47:44.640000::I like double checked it.
0:47:44.640000 - 0:47:45.840000::And I was like, did I get a caffeine?
0:47:45.840000 - 0:47:47.960000::And I was like, it doesn't have caffeine.
0:47:47.960000 - 0:47:50.600000::He's like, dude, good luck.
0:47:50.600000 - 0:47:53::Like I had just purchased like crack cocaine.
0:47:53.840000 - 0:47:56.360000::And I still can't for the life of me.
0:47:56.360000 - 0:47:58.480000::Because I literally, whenever I go to the store,
0:47:58.480000 - 0:48:00.520000::I'll check a couple of primes to see if there's
0:48:00.520000 - 0:48:01.480000::like an outrageous one.
0:48:01.480000 - 0:48:02::No, no.
0:48:02 - 0:48:04.600000::And all of them are like coconut water, like caffeine-free.
0:48:04.600000 - 0:48:05.760000::Like, what did he drink?
0:48:05.760000 - 0:48:07.360000::One of them.
0:48:07.360000 - 0:48:11::One of them does have caffeine.
0:48:11 - 0:48:12.080000::But here's the caffeine-
0:48:12.080000 - 0:48:12.840000::Oh, there's the one, right?
0:48:12.840000 - 0:48:14.080000::Yeah.
0:48:14.080000 - 0:48:16.880000::But he was making it seem like it was like meth.
0:48:16.880000 - 0:48:19.640000::Like he was like, good luck, man.
0:48:19.640000 - 0:48:22.680000::There's one energy drink at my gym
0:48:22.760000 - 0:48:25.280000::that is 400 milligrams.
0:48:25.280000 - 0:48:26.280000::What the fuck?
0:48:28.280000 - 0:48:29.960000::And you think it's in the tar bottle, right?
0:48:29.960000 - 0:48:30.800000::Wrong.
0:48:30.800000 - 0:48:32.040000::It's basically in a little shooter.
0:48:32.040000 - 0:48:33.760000::It's like a tiny little,
0:48:33.760000 - 0:48:36.480000::it's like the cricket gum from men in black,
0:48:36.480000 - 0:48:39.080000::the smallest gun has the most biggest bang.
0:48:39.080000 - 0:48:42.080000::Let me tell you how much caffeine I'm taking in a day.
0:48:42.080000 - 0:48:44.160000::And you guys can kind of,
0:48:44.160000 - 0:48:45.960000::you guys can tell me if you're concerned.

0:48:48.160000 - 0:48:49.480000::How much is in a 1 cup?
0:48:49.480000 - 0:48:50.480000::How much is in a 1 cup?
0:48:50.480000 - 0:48:51.320000::How much is in a 1 cup?
0:48:51.320000 - 0:48:52.600000::80 milligrams.
0:48:52.600000 - 0:48:54::Let me look it up right now.
0:48:54 - 0:48:56::One cup of coffee here.
0:48:56 - 0:48:59.240000::One eight ounce cup of coffee, 200 millis.
0:49:00.280000 - 0:49:01.280000::Let me see.
0:49:01.280000 - 0:49:02.360000::Did you look it up?
0:49:02.360000 - 0:49:03.880000::No, but I'm pretty confident.
0:49:03.880000 - 0:49:04.680000::95.
0:49:04.680000 - 0:49:06.360000::Not because 80, 95.
0:49:06.360000 - 0:49:07.200000::Oh, hold on a second.
0:49:07.200000 - 0:49:10::Because the diet cocoa have 40 to 80,
0:49:10 - 0:49:12.160000::depending on the serving.
0:49:12.160000 - 0:49:15.160000::If it's a plastic bottle, it'll get up there.
0:49:16.040000 - 0:49:16.880000::All right.
0:49:16.880000 - 0:49:19.280000::I'm going to be honest with you guys and be vulnerable.
0:49:19.280000 - 0:49:20.480000::I'm not proud of this.
0:49:20.480000 - 0:49:23.440000::But this is how many cups that I'm drinking of coffee.
0:49:23.440000 - 0:49:24.760000::I'm not talking about mugs.
0:49:24.760000 - 0:49:29.040000::I'm talking about like cups as in the serving size.
0:49:29.040000 - 0:49:30.200000::The serving size.
0:49:30.200000 - 0:49:31.040000::All right.
0:49:31.040000 - 0:49:32.040000::So you put it in your mug.
0:49:32.040000 - 0:49:32.840000::That's probably like two cups.
0:49:32.840000 - 0:49:33.680000::All right.
0:49:33.680000 - 0:49:34.680000::Right.
0:49:34.680000 - 0:49:35.680000::Okay.
0:49:35.680000 - 0:49:40.680000::I'm filling up my coffee pot to about six to the six.
0:49:41.160000 - 0:49:44.720000::Is that fucked up to drink all that every single day?
0:49:44.720000 - 0:49:46.920000::So you get in about some.
0:49:46.920000 - 0:49:49.200000::You're getting in about how much is that?
0:49:49.200000 - 0:49:50.520000::600 milligrams.
0:49:50.520000 - 0:49:52.520000::600 grams of caffeine.
0:49:52.520000 - 0:49:53.520000::That's too much, Nate.
0:49:53.520000 - 0:49:55.800000::It's too much.
0:49:55.800000 - 0:49:57.360000::I'm not getting any to cut down.
0:49:57.360000 - 0:49:58.200000::It's a stir.
0:49:58.200000 - 0:50:00.760000::It's what's going to happen to me.

0:50:00 - 0:50:03.860000::If you cut down well remember a little house on the prairie
0:50:06.880000 - 0:50:10.880000::I don't remember that show well you're missing house little house
0:50:10.880000 - 0:50:16.140000::There's an episode where the mom you know they live on the prairie right so they don't get the softy out of it
0:50:16.140000 - 0:50:22.560000::They can't just go to the grocery store they have to be they have to ration they run out of coffee and the mom begin getting
0:50:22.560000 - 0:50:25.400000::My grains because she's addicted to coffee
0:50:26.160000 - 0:50:31.520000::So what you need to do is wean yourself. I'm on I'm a one cup a day. Okay. That's all I need
0:50:33.320000 - 0:50:39.400000::We need to be there. Yeah, you can't don't that's the first step. I'm saying that. I don't know if I can

0:50:49.200000 - 0:50:55.360000::You why would you why if you have no reason? This is the thing if you have no symptoms of anything
0:50:55.560000 - 0:51:00.280000::Don't fix a problem that ain't broken you understand no symptoms means a okay
0:51:00.720000 - 0:51:06.800000::Symptomless you're good to go and there are some symptoms that are invisible that are
0:51:07.680000 - 0:51:12.560000::We are ignoring and they're not actually that invisible and then one day they just catch up and that's the end
0:51:13.040000 - 0:51:15.040000::Sinara but that's
0:51:16.160000 - 0:51:22.520000::Fine, that's what that's just life. They you need to do the no caffeine body transformation video
0:51:22.560000 - 0:51:26.640000::What happens to your body? You know caffeine for six weeks?
0:51:27.680000 - 0:51:34.320000::I feel I feel like that would route like if I did people say that going through what caffeine withdrawal is worse than
0:51:34.920000 - 0:51:37.420000::like childbirth child
0:51:42.720000 - 0:51:48.280000::You if you go off caffeine your eye the bags under your eyes are gonna go down to your knees son
