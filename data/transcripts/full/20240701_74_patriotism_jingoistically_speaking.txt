0:03:01.920000 - 0:03:07.960000::No, this is the highest my vocab goes.
0:03:07.960000 - 0:03:08.960000::This is the very top.
0:03:08.960000 - 0:03:09.960000::This is the top word.
0:03:09.960000 - 0:03:13.960000::Everyone has the top words and I'd like to know which predilection.

0:03:15.960000 - 0:03:16.960000::I've been using it.
0:03:16.960000 - 0:03:17.960000::We're going to beosexual.

0:03:21.360000 - 0:03:23.360000::And mine is gingoism.
0:03:23.360000 - 0:03:24.360000::Oh, bro.
0:03:24.360000 - 0:03:26.360000::Do you just come around to gingoism?
0:03:26.360000 - 0:03:28.760000::That's very gingoistic of me.
0:03:28.760000 - 0:03:30.760000::That's quite gingoistic.
0:03:30.760000 - 0:03:31.760000::Jingoistic of me.
0:03:31.760000 - 0:03:32.760000::Jingoistic of me.
0:03:32.760000 - 0:03:35.760000::So now gingoism is what?
0:03:35.760000 - 0:03:36.760000::Exactly.
0:03:36.760000 - 0:03:37.760000::As you would define it, I'm curious to know.
0:03:37.760000 - 0:03:38.760000::I would define it.
0:03:38.760000 - 0:03:43.360000::It is basically a blind patriotism.
0:03:43.360000 - 0:03:44.360000::Okay.
0:03:44.360000 - 0:03:49.360000::You're rooting for the Cleveland Browns because you live in Cleveland.
0:03:49.360000 - 0:03:50.360000::Yeah.
0:03:50.360000 - 0:03:52.160000::Not because they're a good team.
0:03:52.160000 - 0:03:53.560000::Not because they speak to your soul.
0:03:53.560000 - 0:03:54.560000::Not because they are.
0:03:54.560000 - 0:03:58.360000::You like how the players look and you like that sort of vibe.
0:03:58.360000 - 0:04:01.760000::You're just rooting for them because you live in Cleveland.
0:04:01.760000 - 0:04:02.760000::How sad is that?
0:04:02.760000 - 0:04:07.160000::So every patriot is a gingoistic minded individual?
0:04:07.160000 - 0:04:08.160000::Well, no, it depends.
0:04:08.160000 - 0:04:09.160000::Exactly.
0:04:09.160000 - 0:04:13.160000::No, man, it depends on your reasons for patriotism.
0:04:13.160000 - 0:04:17.880000::Is it because you were just simply born somewhere?
0:04:17.880000 - 0:04:22.640000::Is it because Joe Biden's putting on a clinic everywhere he runs?
0:04:22.640000 - 0:04:24.640000::And that's the way you're clinic.
0:04:24.640000 - 0:04:26.640000::The clinic is what he's running.
0:04:26.640000 - 0:04:27.640000::Come on.
0:04:27.640000 - 0:04:31.480000::I know it's related, but are we allowed to be patient listening to that?
0:04:31.480000 - 0:04:32.480000::Him is what I mean.
0:04:32.480000 - 0:04:36.480000::Well, you have to be patient in what you're turned if you're up against him because
0:04:36.480000 - 0:04:37.720000::wait for your turn in the grave.
0:04:37.720000 - 0:04:38.720000::That's right.
0:04:38.720000 - 0:04:40.480000::By the way, we just watched the debates.
0:04:40.480000 - 0:04:41.480000::The American debates.

0:07:32.320000 - 0:07:39.960000::Nothing's ever been so worth it though, right? So a couple thoughts on Biden if I may. Yeah, please for one
0:07:42.160000 - 0:07:45.880000::The way he speaks right, okay, so people have a problem with the way that he speaks
0:07:46.240000 - 0:07:50.840000::Roving is a problem with the content so it's almost like it's the delivery system
0:07:51.440000 - 0:07:55::So would you rather have pizza from Trump's pizza hut?
0:07:55.280000 - 0:07:58.080000::Trump eat a with a pizza. Yeah, it gets there on time
0:07:58.720000 - 0:08:03.680000::But it doesn't taste that good doesn't it's a little racist, isn't it is racist and homophobic?
0:08:05.320000 - 0:08:11.760000::I don't know his homophobic because I do feel like he from the tech threads that I've been screen shot at in set

0:08:16.680000 - 0:08:20.600000::It's still counts dude, right. I feel like Trump is a secret ally
0:08:21.080000 - 0:08:26.920000::Yeah, you know what I think in the 90s, I think he's a snake. He's gone inside the system
0:08:26.920000 - 0:08:30.840000::I'm trying to go into his heart of hearts. He would be like I'm an ally
0:08:30.840000 - 0:08:36.080000::I'm rough with these people. But he just simply can't he's just his his perclin

0:10:15.920000 - 0:10:18.640000::That's why he's so special. He definitely got that chest hair
0:10:18.640000 - 0:10:21.840000::I know that because if if he walked out from the pool house

0:14:31.600000 - 0:14:36.080000::Let's dial the clock back a little bit back to when it really mattered 17
0:14:36.080000 - 0:14:38.080000::1770
0:14:38.640000 - 0:14:42.200000::1776 years after Jesus Christ
0:14:45.440000 - 0:14:47.440000::No, he didn't do that
0:14:48.240000 - 0:14:50.880000::So you know that BC doesn't mean before Christ
0:14:52.480000 - 0:14:56.960000::Yeah, BC BC and what is a D mean be after
0:14:57.680000 - 0:14:59.680000::No, I know don't I

0:15:00 - 0:15:02::and the
0:15:02 - 0:15:04::nine
0:15:04 - 0:15:07::what is that line phrase?
0:15:07 - 0:15:09::Is that a Latin phrase?
0:15:09 - 0:15:11::After death would be too convenient.
0:15:11 - 0:15:12::After death.
0:15:12 - 0:15:13::How do you think it's a riddle?
0:15:13 - 0:15:14::Absolutely.
0:15:14 - 0:15:15::What's a good idea?
0:15:15 - 0:15:16::Do you think it's after death?
0:15:16 - 0:15:18::100% after death.
0:15:18 - 0:15:20::I think it's
0:15:20 - 0:15:21::a 10Ls going to be.
0:15:21 - 0:15:23::Did you just make that after?
0:15:23 - 0:15:24::It's really good.
0:15:24 - 0:15:27::Meaning, death though, maybe it's after D.
0:15:27 - 0:15:29::Well, what's the D stand for?
0:15:29 - 0:15:30::It's not D.
0:15:30 - 0:15:31::It's not D.
0:15:31 - 0:15:32::Bro, Bactorialists.
0:15:32 - 0:15:36::Okay, I was off one letter so no one fucking get me.
0:15:36 - 0:15:37::Yeah.
0:15:37 - 0:15:38::I'm sweating.
0:15:38 - 0:15:40::A.D. means anodomany.
0:15:40 - 0:15:41::Anodomany.
0:15:41 - 0:15:42::Anodomany.
0:15:42 - 0:15:43::Anodomany.
0:15:43 - 0:15:44::Anodomany.
0:15:44 - 0:15:50::That's A.D. stands for anodomany, which is Latin for the year of our Lord.
0:15:50 - 0:15:51::Okay.
0:15:51 - 0:15:53::If you thought after death this whole time.
0:15:53 - 0:15:56::B.C. does not stand for before Christ.
0:15:56 - 0:15:58::The after death is an interesting concept though.
0:15:58 - 0:16:02::I say, because you know what the after life stands for, right?
0:16:02 - 0:16:03::The after life.
0:16:03 - 0:16:05::I don't know what I mean to stand for.
0:16:05 - 0:16:06::Right.
0:16:06 - 0:16:07::But you know what it means.
0:16:07 - 0:16:08::Okay.
0:16:08 - 0:16:09::So what's the after death?
0:16:09 - 0:16:10::That's what life is.
0:16:10 - 0:16:12::Wouldn't you like to know?
0:16:12 - 0:16:13::Wow.
0:16:13 - 0:16:15::Wouldn't you like to know what's happening?
0:16:15 - 0:16:19::You saying you know what happens after you like the life after you die?
0:16:19 - 0:16:21::I find that to be very concerning.
0:16:21 - 0:16:26.500000::And because if you're a true skeptic, then there's obviously you have to just say you
0:16:26.500000 - 0:16:27.500000::don't know.
0:16:27.500000 - 0:16:33.500000::Skeptic is another word for afraid to believe faithless.
0:16:33.500000 - 0:16:35.500000::You know that right?
0:16:35.500000 - 0:16:40.500000::What if I said faith was an acronym for false accusate false.
0:16:40.500000 - 0:16:41.500000::Get it.
0:16:41.500000 - 0:16:42.500000::Don't make me do it.
0:16:42.500000 - 0:16:43.500000::False.

0:17:00.500000 - 0:17:01.500000::Wow.
0:17:01.500000 - 0:17:02.500000::Wow.
0:17:02.500000 - 0:17:03.500000::That is crazy.
0:17:03.500000 - 0:17:06.500000::I can't believe you just pulled that off.
0:17:06.500000 - 0:17:13.500000::Well, that's about four or five months on the cruise ship doing the improv.
0:17:13.500000 - 0:17:14.500000::So yeah.
0:17:14.500000 - 0:17:15.500000::You think I'm fucking slow, right?
0:17:15.500000 - 0:17:16.500000::But I'm just psyched.
0:17:16.500000 - 0:17:17.500000::No one said that.
0:17:17.500000 - 0:17:19.500000::My body temperature is rising.
0:17:19.500000 - 0:17:20.500000::Now here's the thing, Jack.
0:17:20.500000 - 0:17:21.500000::Now here's the thing.
0:17:21.500000 - 0:17:24.500000::You're sweating like a pig disgusting.
0:17:24.500000 - 0:17:27.500000::When I'm in New York, I...
0:17:27.500000 - 0:17:32.580000::If this was the temperature in New York, I would be sweating through all my clothes in a
0:17:32.580000 - 0:17:33.580000::concerning way.
0:17:33.580000 - 0:17:34.580000::I feel that way right now.
0:17:34.580000 - 0:17:41.740000::But in Los Angeles, somehow I'm going on long, mile on walks, barely cracking a sweat.
0:17:41.740000 - 0:17:44.500000::It just boils down to the humidity, doesn't it?
0:17:44.500000 - 0:17:45.500000::Right.
0:17:45.500000 - 0:17:46.500000::And I want to get into this.
0:17:46.500000 - 0:17:47.500000::I mean, we already did heat.
0:17:47.500000 - 0:17:51.500000::We already did the heat episode, which I think we actually just talked about.
0:17:51.500000 - 0:17:54.500000::Back to 1776.
0:17:54.500000 - 0:17:55.500000::Right.
0:17:55.500000 - 0:17:56.500000::I know, Dominique.
0:17:56.500000 - 0:17:59.500000::What was the world like at this time?
0:17:59.500000 - 0:18:06.500000::Well, it was ruled essentially by Spain, the British Empire.
0:18:06.500000 - 0:18:08.500000::No, Spain had a part of it.
0:18:08.500000 - 0:18:11.500000::Well, yes, Spain was kicking frameworks down.
0:18:11.500000 - 0:18:13.500000::They were down several pegs by this point in time.
0:18:13.500000 - 0:18:15.500000::They were bodied by the British Navy.
0:18:15.500000 - 0:18:16.500000::Well, the British...
0:18:16.500000 - 0:18:17.500000::...the Armada.
0:18:17.500000 - 0:18:19.500000::Right.
0:18:19.500000 - 0:18:20.500000::So...
0:18:20.500000 - 0:18:26.500000::And so if we're in the first ever patriotic act, you listen, man.
0:18:26.500000 - 0:18:27.500000::Okay.
0:18:27.500000 - 0:18:28.500000::Okay.
0:18:28.500000 - 0:18:29.500000::Okay.
0:18:29.500000 - 0:18:30.500000::So you're thinking...
0:18:30.500000 - 0:18:31.500000::No, no, no, no.
0:18:31.500000 - 0:18:35.500000::I just want to imagine if we were three businessmen, three...
0:18:35.500000 - 0:18:43.500000::Businessmen in the year 1776, years before the Revolution, what's happening to us?
0:18:43.500000 - 0:18:45.500000::We're being taxed, I hell.
0:18:45.500000 - 0:18:47.500000::We're definitely going to be in the war.
0:18:47.500000 - 0:18:48.500000::Right.
0:18:48.500000 - 0:18:49.500000::We're going to be in the war.
0:18:49.500000 - 0:18:50.500000::Right.
0:18:50.500000 - 0:18:51.500000::There wasn't an age limit on that shit too.
0:18:51.500000 - 0:18:52.500000::Well, you know there was a hell now.
0:18:52.500000 - 0:18:57.500000::There was 40, 50-year-olds, and probably mostly older males.
0:18:57.500000 - 0:19:00.500000::Because the board didn't take that much effort back then.
0:19:00.500000 - 0:19:01.500000::Well, you just still...
0:19:01.500000 - 0:19:06.500000::You would think, but they didn't have tanks or any jeeps for you to get around and say it to Watt.
0:19:06.500000 - 0:19:07.500000::Who fit?
0:19:07.500000 - 0:19:08.500000::Well, that is horses.
0:19:08.500000 - 0:19:12.500000::Or literally who fit, but yeah, horses.
0:19:12.500000 - 0:19:14.500000::What do you say?
0:19:14.500000 - 0:19:15.500000::What do you say?
0:19:15.500000 - 0:19:16.500000::We were three businessmen.
0:19:16.500000 - 0:19:17.500000::Oh, I see.
0:19:17.500000 - 0:19:18.500000::1770, right.
0:19:18.500000 - 0:19:23.500000::What would you think we would be getting a little annoyed by...
0:19:23.500000 - 0:19:25.500000::Oh, the taxation without being represented?
0:19:25.500000 - 0:19:27.500000::Well, I'll take that to the presentation.
0:19:27.500000 - 0:19:29.500000::The president's day, the president's of Washington, D.C.
0:19:29.500000 - 0:19:32.500000::What does it say on their license plates?
0:19:32.500000 - 0:19:34.500000::Taxation.
0:19:34.500000 - 0:19:37.500000::Scene representation.
0:19:37.500000 - 0:19:38.500000::Another last name.
0:19:38.500000 - 0:19:39.500000::Scene.
0:19:39.500000 - 0:19:40.500000::That's right.
0:19:40.500000 - 0:19:41.500000::Oh, sorry.
0:19:41.500000 - 0:19:43.500000::Oh, this is taxation without representation.
0:19:43.500000 - 0:19:45.500000::Why don't we get pissed off about taxes?
0:19:45.500000 - 0:19:47.500000::Nobody's throwing a f*** over it.
0:19:47.500000 - 0:19:49.500000::I have a problem with my joyous.
0:19:49.500000 - 0:19:51.500000::Why don't I look at pissed off about paying taxes?
0:19:51.500000 - 0:19:53.500000::Why don't I get pissed off about showing up for my family?
0:19:53.500000 - 0:19:57.500000::Why don't I get pissed off about being responsible for my actions and for my community?
0:19:57.500000 - 0:19:59.500000::That's why I don't get pissed off by people.

0:20:00 - 0:20:01::Pantaxes man.
0:20:01.840000 - 0:20:04.360000::That's why we are pacified.
0:20:04.840000 - 0:20:15::The elites, the top echelon they have pacified us into being okay with the control that they've put on us.
0:20:15 - 0:20:18.880000::With what hydrogenated oils, highly processed sugars,
0:20:19.160000 - 0:20:22.240000::it won't just pornography available at your fingertips at any moment.

0:21:03.320000 - 0:21:04.240000::I'm not right.
0:21:04.240000 - 0:21:04.520000::Right.

0:21:53.040000 - 0:21:54.480000::It isn't out of damn shame.
0:21:54.880000 - 0:21:59.680000::Patriotism should mean love, free love, free sex, polyamory.
0:22:01.680000 - 0:22:06.680000::Because every other flag has somebody flying the Serbian flag, Croatian, whatever.
0:22:06.680000 - 0:22:07.040000::Right.
0:22:07.040000 - 0:22:11.200000::It's like they're, I usually see that flag in the context of orgy or something like this.

0:22:26.360000 - 0:22:29.360000::And it's not weird to rock with the big country wide pump.
0:22:30.240000 - 0:22:31.320000::Only in America, man.
0:22:31.360000 - 0:22:33.760000::We've gotten so uptight about sexuality.

0:22:41 - 0:22:45.560000::Like, rallies are supposed to be the four specific things you just show up to.
0:22:46.080000 - 0:22:48.880000::Rally is another word for personal expression time.
0:22:51.720000 - 0:22:52.800000::That's a sure rally.

0:23:04.560000 - 0:23:05.440000::I thought I had it.
0:23:05.440000 - 0:23:06.200000::That's a hard one.
0:23:06.200000 - 0:23:09.800000::What was everybody's to ask about radical radical

0:23:30.120000 - 0:23:31.120000::You can literally do anything.
0:23:31.120000 - 0:23:34.120000::So I want to comment on something you just said, dude.
0:23:34.120000 - 0:23:39.120000::So you said American patriotism now means being a pig, right?
0:23:39.120000 - 0:23:40.120000::A racist pig, which I like.
0:23:40.120000 - 0:23:44.120000::If any racist pigs are listening to actual pigs,

0:24:01.120000 - 0:24:06.120000::I would say a patriot now is more something akin to what a true journalist is.
0:24:06.120000 - 0:24:11.120000::Someone that you do the truth, a YouTuber who has a

0:24:36.120000 - 0:24:37.120000::The true social.
0:24:37.120000 - 0:24:38.120000::Yeah, another thing.
0:24:38.120000 - 0:24:42.120000::We should have words that are sacred that should mean what they actually mean.
0:24:42.120000 - 0:24:43.120000::I know you're right.
0:24:43.120000 - 0:24:44.120000::You know what I'm saying?
0:24:44.120000 - 0:24:46.120000::Words don't mean anything.
0:24:46.120000 - 0:24:53.120000::Words are clay with which we use to sculpt messages from one person to another without having to physically grab them and show them around.
0:24:53.120000 - 0:24:56.120000::Well, I don't want to hear these.
0:24:56.120000 - 0:24:58.120000::There's no such thing as meaning.
0:24:58.120000 - 0:24:59.120000::Can I just say that?
0:24:59.120000 - 0:25:00.120000::What am I doing right?
0:25:00.120000 - 0:25:01.120000::What is it?
0:25:01.120000 - 0:25:02.120000::I'm going to say that.
0:25:02.120000 - 0:25:03.120000::I'm going to say that.
0:25:03.120000 - 0:25:04.120000::I'm going to say that.
0:25:04.120000 - 0:25:05.120000::I'm going to say that.
0:25:05.120000 - 0:25:06.120000::I'm going to say that.

0:25:00 - 0:25:02.960000::What is this? A table right here? What is this? A couch?
0:25:02.960000 - 0:25:05.760000::Yeah, couch. What is this? Not an alcoholic beer, second one of the night?
0:25:06.640000 - 0:25:09.520000::You think I'm really touching, I think I'm really touching all these things, right?
0:25:09.520000 - 0:25:13.680000::And I'm interacting with it. This is the truth of reality. Really, our senses are trying to make
0:25:13.680000 - 0:25:16.160000::sense of a world that we don't understand.
0:25:16.160000 - 0:25:17.200000::A holographic reality.
0:25:17.200000 - 0:25:18.960000::And so even this isn't truth.
0:25:18.960000 - 0:25:20.400000::That's something a little different.
0:25:21.360000 - 0:25:28.240000::Well, because you have depersonalization in a way that we had our whole world here for that.
0:25:28.240000 - 0:25:34.400000::Yeah, that's true. I have repersonalization. What's that mean? I don't know, man.
0:25:35.760000 - 0:25:44.400000::Now I'm back to that. In 1772, Christopher Columbus set us up for a comeback later.
0:25:44.400000 - 0:25:47.040000::You know what I'm saying? Yeah. So 1776.
0:25:47.040000 - 0:25:52.160000::This podcast should be banned for like, high schoolers. You know what I'm saying?
0:25:52.160000 - 0:25:54.400000::Right, because teaching them to think too radically.
0:25:54.960000 - 0:25:59.120000::Because we generally quickly can say what we would do, how we would torture Christopher Columbus.
0:25:59.120000 - 0:26:03.840000::All right. How we would torture Christopher Columbus, the man who discovered America.
0:26:04.400000 - 0:26:06.080000::Got it. I put carrots on his fingers.
0:26:06.080000 - 0:26:07.280000::You've seen that. You put it that way.
0:26:08.240000 - 0:26:10.080000::You just discovered America.
0:26:10.080000 - 0:26:19.520000::And by the way, Christopher Columbus, he's Italian.
0:26:20.560000 - 0:26:23.200000::Have you ever met with a fucking last name Columbus?
0:26:23.760000 - 0:26:29.440000::There's no fucking he might have been one of the young Columbia Giovanni Colombiano.
0:26:30 - 0:26:31.120000::Maybe I believe it.
0:26:31.120000 - 0:26:34.240000::All right. He was Hungarian.
0:26:35.360000 - 0:26:37.680000::That's what you're going to do. The Da Vinci could
0:26:37.680000 - 0:26:39.520000::to Christopher Columbus and find out he's hungarian.
0:26:39.520000 - 0:26:41.040000::He's Italian. Are you sure about that?
0:26:41.040000 - 0:26:42.880000::100% the Google has asked.
0:26:44 - 0:26:46.080000::You know what I would do? How we're talking about torturing him?
0:26:46.800000 - 0:26:49.200000::Are you torturing or punishing him physically?
0:26:49.200000 - 0:26:52.080000::Okay. I would make him as hungry as any human being has ever been.
0:26:52.880000 - 0:26:57.600000::And then what I do is I put delicious pickled carrots on top of his fingers.
0:26:57.600000 - 0:26:59.680000::And then right when I said, I said, go ahead, take a bite.
0:26:59.680000 - 0:27:02.160000::And then right when he did, I moved my other way by his own finger.
0:27:03.200000 - 0:27:04.240000::Then he let him go.
0:27:04.240000 - 0:27:05.920000::And then I touch his...
0:27:06.720000 - 0:27:07.760000::No, no, no, no, no, no.
0:27:07.760000 - 0:27:10.160000::Not like that. Not like that.
0:27:10.160000 - 0:27:10.960000::Not like that.
0:27:10.960000 - 0:27:13.040000::Not like that. I mean, with my life, they're his head.
0:27:14.640000 - 0:27:14.960000::So...
0:27:17.040000 - 0:27:17.920000::So, wow.
0:27:17.920000 - 0:27:19.200000::What was your low-dive first thing?
0:27:19.200000 - 0:27:24.720000::I would probably... First off, I would consult some of the Indigenous communities first off,
0:27:24.720000 - 0:27:28.320000::because I feel like it's there right to have the...
0:27:28.320000 - 0:27:29.520000::Justice...
0:27:29.520000 - 0:27:30.880000::Right. The torture medias...
0:27:30.880000 - 0:27:31.840000::The medias chose it.
0:27:31.840000 - 0:27:33.680000::It's not mine. It's not a council.
0:27:33.680000 - 0:27:34.720000::It shouldn't be my fucking situation.
0:27:34.720000 - 0:27:36.640000::Through a council they would choose.
0:27:37.360000 - 0:27:38.080000::Yep.
0:27:38.080000 - 0:27:39.760000::And by the way, let's not make fun of torture.
0:27:39.760000 - 0:27:42::It's one of the worst things I can have into a person other than death.
0:27:43.040000 - 0:27:48::So we're not making fun of that, but we are making fun of his Christopher Columbus and his racist ways.
0:27:49.280000 - 0:27:49.840000::Well...
0:27:49.840000 - 0:27:51.680000::Christopher Columbus was ugly as...
0:27:51.680000 - 0:27:52.880000::Oh, he was ugly as a...
0:27:52.880000 - 0:27:54.480000::I don't know if he was looking up a picture of him right now.
0:27:54.480000 - 0:27:55.280000::He called that ugly.
0:27:56.880000 - 0:27:57.360000::He looks...
0:27:58.800000 - 0:27:59.600000::Fugly to me.
0:28:00.480000 - 0:28:02.880000::And this is a person that had power to like...
0:28:02.880000 - 0:28:04::To over an artist...
0:28:04.640000 - 0:28:06.480000::Drawing him, you know? Like the...
0:28:06.480000 - 0:28:07.520000::The person who was drawing this...
0:28:07.520000 - 0:28:08.160000::Right.
0:28:08.160000 - 0:28:12.800000::Was a peasant who he could like rip off their throat if he didn't make them look sexy.
0:28:12.800000 - 0:28:14.080000::He kind of looks like Hillary Clinton.
0:28:14.080000 - 0:28:16::Yeah, he's actually a face filter.
0:28:16 - 0:28:17.920000::He looks like Hillary Clinton in college.
0:28:18 - 0:28:19.200000::Brow...
0:28:19.200000 - 0:28:20.240000::Give her a break.
0:28:20.960000 - 0:28:24.080000::I gave her many breaks and she used them to smoke crack on my grave.
0:28:27.600000 - 0:28:28.400000::He is from Italy.
0:28:29.680000 - 0:28:30.480000::Yup.
0:28:30.480000 - 0:28:32::And you got me.
0:28:32 - 0:28:33.120000::Interesting.
0:28:33.120000 - 0:28:35.040000::He's buried in a lot of different places.
0:28:35.840000 - 0:28:36.720000::Oh, never mind.
0:28:36.720000 - 0:28:37.360000::No, he is.
0:28:38.480000 - 0:28:39.280000::I wonder if...
0:28:39.280000 - 0:28:40::Okay.
0:28:40 - 0:28:42.240000::If Christopher Columbus had never come over here, right?
0:28:42.240000 - 0:28:44::None of us ever came over here.
0:28:44 - 0:28:46.720000::There were the European nations, the Asian nations.
0:28:47.520000 - 0:28:50::And the American nations.
0:28:50 - 0:28:52::If no one ever met in the middle,
0:28:52 - 0:28:57.760000::but they all technologically advanced in their own ways for centuries, maybe up to thousands of years,
0:28:57.760000 - 0:28:59.600000::we never figured out boat travel.
0:28:59.600000 - 0:29:01.440000::So, boat we figured out all the other types of travel.
0:29:04 - 0:29:04.800000::But if we all...
0:29:04.800000 - 0:29:05.120000::Right.
0:29:05.120000 - 0:29:08.080000::Well, don't make fun because boats are extremely hard to figure out.
0:29:10.400000 - 0:29:12.960000::But imagine the science fiction book like this.
0:29:12.960000 - 0:29:15.440000::All of the different continents.
0:29:15.920000 - 0:29:18::Even Australia too, they're Aboriginal people.
0:29:19.040000 - 0:29:22.400000::Would they all make their own crazy advanced technologies like Wakanda?
0:29:22.400000 - 0:29:26.480000::And then in the year 4,000, we all find each other crazy battle.
0:29:28.080000 - 0:29:30.160000::With all their different types of technologies.
0:29:30.160000 - 0:29:30.800000::You know what I'm saying?
0:29:30.800000 - 0:29:33.680000::Because they would come up with technologies we can't even comprehend it.
0:29:33.680000 - 0:29:34.480000::Yeah.
0:29:34.480000 - 0:29:36.640000::And there's a major battle for 100 years.
0:29:36.640000 - 0:29:40.160000::And then everybody unites as one world for human race.
0:29:40.960000 - 0:29:41.680000::Yeah, right.
0:29:41.680000 - 0:29:43.840000::And then we get to marketplace of ideas
0:29:44.400000 - 0:29:48.400000::that all the ideas are exchanged and we become probably space-faring at that point.
0:29:48.400000 - 0:29:49.600000::I would say...
0:29:49.600000 - 0:29:53.440000::So that's a great place to bring that to.
0:29:53.920000 - 0:29:54.960000::Because the irony is...
0:29:55.760000 - 0:29:56.400000::Lost my breath.
0:29:56.400000 - 0:29:57.200000::I don't explain that.
0:29:58 - 0:29:59.920000::I knew you didn't agree, because there's nothing about that now.

0:30:00 - 0:30:01.280000::I wouldn't worry about that.
0:30:01.280000 - 0:30:02.280000::I wouldn't worry about that.
0:30:02.280000 - 0:30:05.320000::I was just like, that was like maybe a paragraph.
0:30:06.480000 - 0:30:08.320000::No, that was a big long period.
0:30:09.360000 - 0:30:10.200000::It was good.
0:30:10.200000 - 0:30:11.040000::It was a fat one.
0:30:11.040000 - 0:30:13.720000::Now what's interesting is for you to end on the space travel
0:30:13.720000 - 0:30:16.240000::and because that is what is happening right now
0:30:16.240000 - 0:30:17.920000::with human race on earth.
0:30:17.920000 - 0:30:19.200000::We are doing that.
0:30:19.200000 - 0:30:21.800000::And we are separated from Centilian X or whatever.
0:30:21.800000 - 0:30:25.240000::They're cooking up on where they got the version of us
0:30:25.240000 - 0:30:26.080000::doing a lot of hot cakes.
0:30:26.080000 - 0:30:28.240000::Where is Centilian X underwater?
0:30:28.240000 - 0:30:30.400000::Well, it's a planet.
0:30:30.400000 - 0:30:31.240000::It's in space.
0:30:31.240000 - 0:30:31.960000::Oh, right Centilian X.
0:30:31.960000 - 0:30:32.960000::It's not here.
0:30:32.960000 - 0:30:33.800000::Oh, right.
0:30:33.800000 - 0:30:34.640000::Of course.
0:30:34.640000 - 0:30:35.480000::What Centilian X?
0:30:35.480000 - 0:30:36.320000::I just made it up.
0:30:36.320000 - 0:30:37.160000::I don't know.
0:30:37.160000 - 0:30:38::It's a space.
0:30:38 - 0:30:39.240000::It's just, I'm just saying another race of humans
0:30:39.240000 - 0:30:40.760000::on another earth.
0:30:40.760000 - 0:30:41.600000::Yeah.
0:30:41.600000 - 0:30:45.880000::Is feasibly realistically definitely doing what?
0:30:45.880000 - 0:30:46.440000::Sorry about that.
0:30:46.440000 - 0:30:47.440000::Jesus Christ.
0:30:49.440000 - 0:30:50.720000::That's kind of a sickly burp.
0:30:50.720000 - 0:30:54.360000::I mean, I think the folks are showing some sickly sort of cool
0:30:54.360000 - 0:30:55.600000::offers.
0:30:55.600000 - 0:30:56.320000::Let's take a vote.
0:30:56.320000 - 0:31:00.440000::Who do you think, which, which, which, which, which a lad?
0:31:00.440000 - 0:31:03.760000::Do you think is going to die first?
0:31:03.760000 - 0:31:04.520000::Just take a second.
0:31:04.520000 - 0:31:05.120000::Yeah.
0:31:05.120000 - 0:31:07.720000::But really think about your answer and don't do it just on looks.
0:31:07.720000 - 0:31:08.520000::It doesn't mean to see to me.
0:31:08.520000 - 0:31:09.040000::Yeah.
0:31:09.040000 - 0:31:11.560000::Yeah.
0:31:11.560000 - 0:31:16.040000::Let's just get, can we get like, oh, bro.
0:31:16.040000 - 0:31:16.560000::Watch out.
0:31:16.560000 - 0:31:17.400000::That's a sharp knife.
0:31:17.400000 - 0:31:18.200000::That's a sharp knife.
0:31:18.200000 - 0:31:19.920000::That's a very sharp knife.
0:31:19.920000 - 0:31:22.400000::How would people even have been playing with knives like that
0:31:22.400000 - 0:31:25.560000::and ended up losing their life, dude?
0:31:25.560000 - 0:31:26.680000::Unreal.
0:31:26.680000 - 0:31:28.200000::Maybe we should open the door or something.
0:31:28.200000 - 0:31:29.120000::I mean, I'm cooking away.
0:31:29.120000 - 0:31:29.800000::You can't get hot here.
0:31:29.800000 - 0:31:31.320000::Let me turn on the fan, actually.
0:31:31.320000 - 0:31:34.320000::This might affect the audio real quick, but always worth it.
0:31:34.320000 - 0:31:37::Oh.
0:31:37 - 0:31:39.120000::Oh, this is about to get you right.
0:31:39.120000 - 0:31:39.800000::Man.
0:31:39.800000 - 0:31:42.760000::All right, just be go solo for one second area.
0:31:42.760000 - 0:31:45.560000::All right, I've never done this before.
0:31:45.560000 - 0:31:46.480000::What else can I go?
0:31:46.480000 - 0:31:49.440000::Let's go through the American Wars.
0:31:49.440000 - 0:31:51.280000::First off, we have Revolutionary War,
0:31:51.280000 - 0:31:53.640000::where you defeat the British very handling.
0:31:53.640000 - 0:31:54.320000::All right, stop.
0:31:54.320000 - 0:31:55.240000::There you done.
0:31:55.240000 - 0:31:58.600000::I feel like I kind of went into how Biden would tell that story.
0:31:58.600000 - 0:32:00.760000::First off, we just, first off.
0:32:00.760000 - 0:32:04.200000::I don't think I've ever been able to do an impression in my life.
0:32:04.200000 - 0:32:05.320000::Even it.
0:32:05.320000 - 0:32:06.120000::What do you do?
0:32:06.120000 - 0:32:07.440000::Do you do a ice bowl?
0:32:07.440000 - 0:32:08.640000::Yeah.
0:32:08.640000 - 0:32:12.160000::We have ice bowl in the revved up, ready to go.
0:32:12.160000 - 0:32:15.320000::What's more important than being able to do impressions
0:32:15.320000 - 0:32:17::is being able to make an impression.
0:32:17 - 0:32:18.320000::And that's something really good at.
0:32:18.320000 - 0:32:19.520000::And I definitely do that.
0:32:19.520000 - 0:32:20.800000::You do that a few times.
0:32:20.800000 - 0:32:21.800000::After a few meet-times.
0:32:21.800000 - 0:32:24.560000::After a few meet-times.
0:32:24.560000 - 0:32:26.720000::We should come first impressions real quick.
0:32:26.720000 - 0:32:28.160000::So how do you?
0:32:28.160000 - 0:32:29.640000::It's a good episode idea.
0:32:29.640000 - 0:32:31.840000::Because I feel like we could dip in that a little bit,
0:32:31.840000 - 0:32:38.080000::because that's the most important part of maybe the most important moment
0:32:38.080000 - 0:32:41.920000::when you're meeting another person is that first impression.
0:32:41.920000 - 0:32:43.120000::Are you smiling?
0:32:43.120000 - 0:32:44.200000::How's your handshake?
0:32:44.200000 - 0:32:45.040000::How about a laugh?
0:32:45.040000 - 0:32:45.880000::What's your demeanor?
0:32:45.880000 - 0:32:48::What kind of clothes are you wearing?
0:32:48 - 0:32:51.160000::How does your breath smell?
0:32:51.160000 - 0:32:52.680000::How close are you talking to them?
0:32:52.680000 - 0:32:56.120000::If you have something in your teeth the first time that someone meets you,
0:32:56.120000 - 0:32:58.400000::it's not gold.
0:32:58.400000 - 0:32:59.560000::And it's not gold.
0:32:59.560000 - 0:33:00.240000::A gold tip.
0:33:00.240000 - 0:33:00.400000::Oh right.
0:33:00.400000 - 0:33:02.800000::It's not gold or a cigarette or whatever.
0:33:02.800000 - 0:33:03.640000::Oh my god.
0:33:03.640000 - 0:33:06.240000::Or a six milligram cinnamon zins.
0:33:06.240000 - 0:33:06.800000::Four of them.
0:33:06.800000 - 0:33:07.320000::Ganging out.
0:33:07.320000 - 0:33:07.840000::Oh.
0:33:07.840000 - 0:33:08.840000::Oh.
0:33:08.840000 - 0:33:11.480000::I do want to try the cinnamon zins.
0:33:11.480000 - 0:33:13.200000::I bet you do.
0:33:13.200000 - 0:33:14.240000::Come talk to me.
0:33:14.240000 - 0:33:19.640000::I've stocked the reason why I did the shortage is because I've been buying them up
0:33:19.640000 - 0:33:21.720000::and reselling them on.
0:33:21.720000 - 0:33:23.400000::Aftermarket on Poshmark.
0:33:23.400000 - 0:33:26.040000::And I've been buying them from you on Poshmark.
0:33:26.040000 - 0:33:28.440000::It's like buying them from me.
0:33:28.440000 - 0:33:29.440000::You're the man.
0:33:29.440000 - 0:33:30.440000::You're the man for that.
0:33:30.440000 - 0:33:31.440000::I got you.
0:33:31.440000 - 0:33:32.440000::I got you.
0:33:32.440000 - 0:33:33.440000::Why am I going to make browns shiga pop tart?
0:33:33.440000 - 0:33:34.440000::It's in.
0:33:34.440000 - 0:33:35.440000::OK.
0:33:35.440000 - 0:33:36.440000::I did it.
0:33:36.440000 - 0:33:38.440000::It's in at the the bear after party.
0:33:38.440000 - 0:33:40.680000::That went to you the other night that you gave me.
0:33:40.680000 - 0:33:45.280000::And for some reason when I did it, when you gave it to me, it's the most I've ever felt
0:33:45.280000 - 0:33:46.280000::rocked by it.
0:33:46.280000 - 0:33:48.960000::And I was having a hold on hold on to a couch.
0:33:48.960000 - 0:33:51.320000::And I didn't really tell you guys.
0:33:51.320000 - 0:33:52.320000::You did tell me.
0:33:52.320000 - 0:33:53.320000::All right.
0:33:53.320000 - 0:33:55.440000::Well, I didn't tell too many people this, which I found to be a win.
0:33:55.440000 - 0:33:56.440000::I really told everybody.
0:33:56.440000 - 0:33:58.320000::I didn't care me on my own.
0:33:58.320000 - 0:33:59.320000::God.
0:33:59.320000 - 0:34:00.320000::The cigarette goat.
0:34:00.320000 - 0:34:01.320000::We should get people.
0:34:01.320000 - 0:34:05.320000::I bet you people want to hear about the after party.
0:34:05.320000 - 0:34:06.320000::Oh, right.
0:34:06.320000 - 0:34:07.320000::The after party.
0:34:07.320000 - 0:34:10.320000::We were in Hollywood, the heart of color.
0:34:10.320000 - 0:34:11.320000::That's color.
0:34:11.320000 - 0:34:12.320000::Right across.
0:34:12.320000 - 0:34:15.320000::By the way, we can tie this into first impressions because we made a million of them.
0:34:15.320000 - 0:34:19.440000::And we can tie first impressions into American Patriots, because we all represent our country
0:34:19.440000 - 0:34:20.440000::every day online.
0:34:20.440000 - 0:34:24.600000::We're so proud we're so we're so fucking kind of so a fair style.
0:34:24.600000 - 0:34:25.600000::Hello.
0:34:25.600000 - 0:34:26.600000::Yeah.
0:34:26.600000 - 0:34:27.600000::We went to the premiere.
0:34:27.600000 - 0:34:28.600000::Okay.
0:34:28.600000 - 0:34:29.600000::Gigantic theater.
0:34:29.600000 - 0:34:30.600000::This is.
0:34:30.600000 - 0:34:35::I mean, it was 10 right next to the Kimmel HQ right next to the Michael Jackson right.
0:34:35 - 0:34:38.080000::I'm saying I was having by his star.
0:34:38.080000 - 0:34:40.440000::Michael Jackson had passed away badly.
0:34:40.440000 - 0:34:44.160000::Almost one year to the day of the bear premier.
0:34:44.160000 - 0:34:45.160000::Interesting.
0:34:45.160000 - 0:34:46.160000::One year.
0:34:46.160000 - 0:34:47.160000::One.
0:34:47.160000 - 0:34:48.160000::One.
0:34:48.160000 - 0:34:49.160000::Oh, the same day.
0:34:49.160000 - 0:34:50.160000::Okay.
0:34:50.160000 - 0:34:52.160000::No, I don't know what you're.
0:34:52.160000 - 0:34:53.160000::2009.
0:34:53.160000 - 0:34:56.160000::There are 15 year anniversary.
0:34:56.160000 - 0:34:57.160000::I don't know.
0:34:57.160000 - 0:34:58.160000::Nobody.
0:34:58.160000 - 0:34:59.160000::He never.
0:34:59.160000 - 0:35:00.160000::He never.

0:35:00 - 0:35:02.880000::crowded around his star on the Hollywood star.
0:35:02.880000 - 0:35:04.080000::Go on crazy name.
0:35:04.080000 - 0:35:04.920000::And you know what?
0:35:04.920000 - 0:35:08.520000::Sitting down, there was multiple Michael Jackson impressionists,
0:35:08.520000 - 0:35:09.920000::whatever, Dan.
0:35:09.920000 - 0:35:12.360000::People sitting cross-legged were Michael Jackson swag.
0:35:12.360000 - 0:35:12.860000::Yep.
0:35:12.860000 - 0:35:13.880000::Right around the star.
0:35:13.880000 - 0:35:16.400000::When I walked past it, I did not put two and two together
0:35:16.400000 - 0:35:19.600000::and I was like, damn, he's just getting this every single day
0:35:19.600000 - 0:35:22.640000::people are coming through doing that to his star.
0:35:22.640000 - 0:35:23.400000::Now it's a death.
0:35:23.400000 - 0:35:27.640000::I just saw this that he was $500 million in debt when he died.
0:35:27.640000 - 0:35:29.880000::To who?
0:35:29.880000 - 0:35:31.560000::To two, I don't know.
0:35:31.560000 - 0:35:32.560000::To guys.
0:35:32.560000 - 0:35:33.560000::To guys.
0:35:33.560000 - 0:35:35.200000::So much of guys.
0:35:35.200000 - 0:35:36.200000::500 million.
0:35:36.200000 - 0:35:36.720000::That's crazy.
0:35:36.720000 - 0:35:37.200000::So here's a deal.
0:35:37.200000 - 0:35:38.240000::You walk past that.
0:35:38.240000 - 0:35:42.080000::OK, we'll do a whole Michael Jackson trilogy series.
0:35:42.080000 - 0:35:45.040000::So don't worry if you're not about the crime missing out on that.
0:35:45.040000 - 0:35:46.440000::The crimes will get into as well.
0:35:46.440000 - 0:35:47.600000::It's about the music.
0:35:47.600000 - 0:35:48.280000::For now.
0:35:48.280000 - 0:35:49.280000::For now.
0:35:49.280000 - 0:35:50.280000::Just the music.
0:35:50.280000 - 0:35:51.280000::Separate.
0:35:51.280000 - 0:35:52.440000::Don't do anything else.
0:35:52.440000 - 0:35:53.200000::Yeah.
0:35:53.200000 - 0:35:54.480000::You go around the corner.
0:35:54.480000 - 0:35:57.040000::You go to what you call the will call line.
0:35:57.040000 - 0:35:59.840000::You give your name, right?
0:36:00.200000 - 0:36:01.200000::You get a little.
0:36:01.200000 - 0:36:02.480000::You're saying below.
0:36:02.480000 - 0:36:03::Yeah.
0:36:03 - 0:36:06.200000::It says, Ray Hill, come on Eric.
0:36:06.200000 - 0:36:07.640000::What did you guys just envelope said?
0:36:07.640000 - 0:36:08.920000::Mine said comedian.
0:36:08.920000 - 0:36:10.200000::Mine said comedian as well.
0:36:10.200000 - 0:36:11.200000::Mine said comedians.
0:36:11.200000 - 0:36:12.200000::What do you say?
0:36:12.200000 - 0:36:15.200000::I said comedians as well.
0:36:15.200000 - 0:36:15.720000::Right.
0:36:15.720000 - 0:36:19.800000::He watched the episode of the show.
0:36:19.800000 - 0:36:20.800000::Crazy dog.
0:36:20.800000 - 0:36:21.920000::Crazy dog barking outside.
0:36:21.920000 - 0:36:25.400000::Then you walk outside with more celebrities and highly influential producers
0:36:25.400000 - 0:36:26.400000::and CEOs.
0:36:26.400000 - 0:36:29.240000::And you've ever seen your life to a back-out party
0:36:29.240000 - 0:36:32::with over 10 restaurants and attendance.
0:36:32 - 0:36:33.960000::Who can crazy ass meals for you.
0:36:33.960000 - 0:36:35.840000::Because the bear is all about food.
0:36:35.840000 - 0:36:38.880000::It's basically like if you went to Michael Jordan's house to play basketball,
0:36:38.880000 - 0:36:41.440000::you know that court's going to be slamming.
0:36:41.440000 - 0:36:42.440000::That's right.
0:36:42.440000 - 0:36:43.440000::Right.
0:36:43.440000 - 0:36:44.440000::Exactly.
0:36:44.440000 - 0:36:50.600000::So then you end up in what we would call paradise, social paradise, where no one's
0:36:50.600000 - 0:36:51.600000::acting odd.
0:36:51.600000 - 0:36:52.600000::You know what I mean?
0:36:52.600000 - 0:36:54.600000::Everyone's acting like a quote unquote word.
0:36:54.600000 - 0:36:56.880000::It's a word function for us.
0:36:56.880000 - 0:36:58.920000::We don't work, but you know.
0:36:58.920000 - 0:37:01.920000::Because we're so in it.
0:37:01.920000 - 0:37:02.920000::What else?
0:37:02.920000 - 0:37:03.920000::Free liquor.
0:37:03.920000 - 0:37:04.920000::Literally free.
0:37:04.920000 - 0:37:06.920000::I don't know if you guys have ever written a play song like this.
0:37:06.920000 - 0:37:07.920000::Free liquor.
0:37:07.920000 - 0:37:10.440000::Free wine.
0:37:10.440000 - 0:37:11.920000::Bathrooms and trailers.
0:37:11.920000 - 0:37:16.160000::And I was getting worried that I didn't bring a big enough backpack because of the amount
0:37:16.160000 - 0:37:19.200000::of business cards I was getting walking out with.
0:37:19.200000 - 0:37:22.640000::I filled my jam sport just about to the tippy top.
0:37:22.640000 - 0:37:24.440000::Had to start putting them in the side bins.
0:37:24.440000 - 0:37:25.440000::That's right.
0:37:25.560000 - 0:37:28.400000::And the sidecar.
0:37:28.400000 - 0:37:28.880000::Right.
0:37:28.880000 - 0:37:32::We were doing so much in fucking hard networking.
0:37:32 - 0:37:33::Hard hard.
0:37:33 - 0:37:34::Hard.
0:37:34 - 0:37:36.480000::I am D.V. Pro open.
0:37:36.480000 - 0:37:38.600000::That's the head of development at wherever.
0:37:38.600000 - 0:37:39.600000::All right.
0:37:39.600000 - 0:37:40.600000::Let's get a single file.
0:37:40.600000 - 0:37:42.600000::That's why I produce your arm fucking.

0:39:18.120000 - 0:39:24.240000::So I just messaged Colin Joost on Facebook messenger.
0:39:24.240000 - 0:39:26.680000::And I said, hey, I was 18 years old.
0:39:26.680000 - 0:39:29.240000::And I was like, hey, I'm just getting into comedy.
0:39:29.240000 - 0:39:31.200000::Do you have any advice for me?
0:39:31.200000 - 0:39:35.680000::And he wrote me back a really good three minutes later.
0:39:35.680000 - 0:39:36.680000::Good advice.
0:39:36.680000 - 0:39:37.840000::What did he say?
0:39:37.840000 - 0:39:45.480000::It was just basically like, you know, go to somewhere and meet the people that you, you
0:39:45.480000 - 0:39:51.280000::know, are going to meet like, just basically find your tribe and worked really hard doing
0:39:51.280000 - 0:39:52.280000::every day.
0:39:52.280000 - 0:39:53.280000::Whoopsies.
0:39:53.280000 - 0:39:54.280000::It was great.
0:39:54.280000 - 0:39:55.280000::So Colin Joost created JoyTact.
0:39:55.280000 - 0:39:56.280000::This is what you're saying.
0:39:56.280000 - 0:40:00::I had a feeling if you would be my mentor in the end.

0:40:00 - 0:40:05.460000::responded after that. That's a yes. It's not a no shall we shout out his
0:40:05.460000 - 0:40:10.200000::his bow Scarlett Johansson is in a new movie called Fly Me to the Moon

0:40:27.400000 - 0:40:33.560000::Yes, that's his. That's correct. That's good. Better not to stole my girlfriend's
0:40:33.560000 - 0:40:38.640000::awesome idea for a story. I won't even tell it. So the party was fucking popping.
0:40:38.640000 - 0:40:45.120000::I've been hung over for four days. Wait a second. Nate did turn up a little bit
0:40:45.120000 - 0:40:49.120000::in a way I haven't seen in a minute. Well, it just said what lockdown didn't
0:40:49.120000 - 0:40:53::cause I should do the one you did. You did. I was proud of you. But let's just say I had
0:40:53.460000 - 0:41:00.880000::four Cosomeigos drinks. And I had a lot of zen in me mouth.
0:41:01.080000 - 0:41:06.080000::Yo, oh, here's the most crazy interaction. I had the whole last night.
0:41:06.500000 - 0:41:11.440000::Okay. Well, you were doing that drinking little it's it's you bitty drinks from
0:41:11.440000 - 0:41:15.540000::the bartender once plasha to kill a trying to save some money. Whatever. I have a
0:41:15.540000 - 0:41:21.680000::secret hack. You go to the open bar bartender, right? Everybody else is just
0:41:21.800000 - 0:41:25.920000::going up not even saying thank you barely interacting with them. I first I go up
0:41:25.920000 - 0:41:29.520000::asking what scripts they have that they want me to take a look at. Yep. And it
0:41:29.520000 - 0:41:32.480000::reels I can take a quick look at because I can tell them about two seconds what
0:41:32.880000 - 0:41:36.520000::what the vibe is from what you're putting out there creatively. And what am I
0:41:36.520000 - 0:41:42.440000::holding in my hand in my two fingers like this? Not a one, not a two. A fire.
0:41:43.200000 - 0:41:46.360000::A pair of pink panties. That's a great.
0:41:47.320000 - 0:41:54::G.C. I'm holding a $5 bill like this. Oops. I know this is free, but I
0:41:54 - 0:41:59.280000::appreciate your work. And this was so funny. This was that this is that the one
0:41:59.280000 - 0:42:03.240000::of the parties we went to the bartender goes like this. He's holding the bottle
0:42:03.240000 - 0:42:07.880000::of Casomeigos as he should. I said, let me get to kill on the rocks. He sees
0:42:07.880000 - 0:42:14.200000::the five. He clocks it. He goes, let me just go crazy. And I was like, yeah,
0:42:14.200000 - 0:42:18.920000::I wouldn't mind it. He's going like, it's blood, glug, glug, tell me when to stop.
0:42:19.320000 - 0:42:23.280000::Glug, glug, glug, glug, glug. That's a nice right on it. All right.
0:42:25.560000 - 0:42:28.240000::Pretty good. Just a good tip for anybody. Wow. Yeah.
0:42:28.240000 - 0:42:32.640000::You see what I'm saying? If something is free, that doesn't mean you can't pay for it.
0:42:34 - 0:42:37.040000::I'll tell you nothing's free is what I'm learning in this damn town.
0:42:37.040000 - 0:42:40.880000::I'm not sure time. You know, while nothing is looking free.
0:42:41.880000 - 0:42:46.160000::And there's no such thing as a free lunch is what they say.
0:42:46.160000 - 0:42:49.760000::So even when things are free, are they really?
0:42:49.760000 - 0:42:53.480000::I got free lunch. I got a free bouncy ball from David Buster's
0:42:53.480000 - 0:42:58.360000::because I got it for the $5 discount. Five finger discount rather stealing stealing.
0:42:58.360000 - 0:43:01.880000::Okay. I'll admit it. Actually, I didn't do that shit.
0:43:02.920000 - 0:43:06.160000::Because I don't want to get banned from David Buster's. And so I didn't do that.
0:43:07.160000 - 0:43:11.160000::Right. I don't like stealing gold. I wouldn't even do that too old.
0:43:13.400000 - 0:43:16.480000::I did something cool. Now I'm going to talk about it. Well,
0:43:17.680000 - 0:43:22.400000::to circle it back to America, America to you know what pisses me off.
0:43:22.480000 - 0:43:27.040000::Bunch of bars. The people that say America,
0:43:27.040000 - 0:43:29.920000::America, I saw license plate yesterday.
0:43:30.760000 - 0:43:31.760000::Get the book.
0:43:31.760000 - 0:43:34.760000::America out of this country. I can't even say it out loud.
0:43:34.760000 - 0:43:38.320000::America. That is a, that is the most important.
0:43:38.320000 - 0:43:40.840000::If you are listening to this and you said that in some point in your life,
0:43:41.200000 - 0:43:44.280000::maybe because you watch team America, right? That's kind of where it's from.
0:43:44.280000 - 0:43:47.480000::Right. Right. But they say like, I don't even know if they drop a
0:43:47.480000 - 0:43:51.120000::America in there. Like it's like a, oh,
0:43:51.120000 - 0:43:54.960000::if you've done chill for there's still time to change, I would say.
0:43:55.360000 - 0:43:59.600000::But likely those who have done the crime won't be listening to us talk about
0:43:59.680000 - 0:44:02.840000::this. That's what's interesting. The type of people who say,
0:44:02.840000 - 0:44:06.680000::because we're in a bubble, right? We're in a liberal bubble.
0:44:06.680000 - 0:44:10.400000::Like mine did liberal bubble. When can we break out progressive?
0:44:11.520000 - 0:44:13.840000::We're not progressive. No, we are. Oh, no,
0:44:13.840000 - 0:44:17.640000::Democrat liberal firmly in the middle.
0:44:20.480000 - 0:44:22.280000::And while you guys were having that conversation,
0:44:22.280000 - 0:44:26.160000::I was doing two times 1776 in my head. I came up with oh,
0:44:26.200000 - 0:44:28.360000::3000. You're just doing Matt Reign.
0:44:28.360000 - 0:44:30.760000::And 82. Is that correct?
0:44:31.240000 - 0:44:34.720000::We'll never know. So speaking of America,
0:44:35.240000 - 0:44:38.600000::I was taking notes, very specific notes on the debate.
0:44:38.600000 - 0:44:42.200000::And I have to call Trump out on something. Please have to
0:44:42.200000 - 0:44:45.160000::please call Afghanistan.
0:44:45.200000 - 0:44:50.720000::Afghan Afghanistan Afghanistan Afghanistan Afghanistan.
0:44:52.320000 - 0:44:54.960000::All right. Well, that one of the spinners slip up. No,
0:44:54.960000 - 0:44:55.240000::he's
0:44:55.240000 - 0:44:58.960000::a free body slips off. And then instead of the word
0:44:59.640000 - 0:45:00.120000::nation,

0:45:00 - 0:45:02::He said, Nershin.
0:45:02 - 0:45:05.500000::Ah, Trump sucks.
0:45:05.500000 - 0:45:06.840000::He can't even work.
0:45:06.840000 - 0:45:07.840000::Yeah, that's right.
0:45:07.840000 - 0:45:11.800000::He sounds like a broken Furby, if they spoke English.
0:45:11.800000 - 0:45:14.480000::And he has actually a porn star.
0:45:14.480000 - 0:45:17.280000::Why was why he was pregnant?
0:45:17.280000 - 0:45:18.280000::Oh shit.
0:45:18.280000 - 0:45:19.280000::He didn't really clap back.
0:45:19.280000 - 0:45:20.280000::He didn't hold back.
0:45:20.280000 - 0:45:23.280000::No, he didn't hold back, but I wish he had a porn star.
0:45:23.280000 - 0:45:26.020000::A little more fucking power in that voice when he said that.
0:45:26.020000 - 0:45:29.840000::He said that like he was in a library and he was losing his breath.
0:45:29.840000 - 0:45:33.520000::He should fucking take in his tie, grab him.
0:45:33.520000 - 0:45:36.240000::Listen here.
0:45:36.240000 - 0:45:38.200000::He kind of got revved up a little bit.
0:45:38.200000 - 0:45:46.280000::I can see him using up his, his, whatever, the Adderall was in his system or something.
0:45:46.280000 - 0:45:51.280000::What was the thing about that take a drug test before they wanted to have a, what drug was
0:45:51.280000 - 0:45:53.680000::by the dude like what?
0:45:53.680000 - 0:45:54.680000::Men of drill.
0:45:54.680000 - 0:45:58.520000::At that age, listen, at that age, you're on drugs for everything.
0:45:58.520000 - 0:45:59.520000::Everybody is.
0:45:59.520000 - 0:46:00.520000::I know.
0:46:00.520000 - 0:46:02.680000::We probably all should be on statins.
0:46:02.680000 - 0:46:05.040000::I'm on vocal recording drugs right now.
0:46:05.040000 - 0:46:08.360000::If you want to have too tired, I think for this.
0:46:08.360000 - 0:46:10.600000::We're faking it rapidly.
0:46:10.600000 - 0:46:12.600000::No, you just did too.
0:46:12.600000 - 0:46:13.600000::Dude, dude, chill.
0:46:13.600000 - 0:46:19.120000::By the way, anybody judging Jack, just know what he's going through right now, okay?
0:46:19.120000 - 0:46:22.240000::He was at the pool today.
0:46:22.240000 - 0:46:24.800000::We had a big giant salsa and beard.
0:46:24.800000 - 0:46:25.800000::God damn it.
0:46:25.800000 - 0:46:29.200000::We were really made me sleep like a baby.
0:46:29.200000 - 0:46:33.240000::I swear to God, I think I had a thousand calories and just chill.
0:46:33.240000 - 0:46:34.240000::You wouldn't stop eating.
0:46:34.240000 - 0:46:36.960000::I couldn't believe that you were eating so much.
0:46:36.960000 - 0:46:39.400000::That, I never seen you eating that.
0:46:39.400000 - 0:46:40.400000::And we're seeing you eating that.
0:46:40.400000 - 0:46:47.360000::Something about the, something about that place puts me into a trance.
0:46:47.360000 - 0:46:53.920000::Like I just can't, I'm like so locked in and I just want to eat my fucking ass off, dude.
0:46:53.920000 - 0:46:59.880000::It's like, it is, it's a culinary paradise is what it is.
0:46:59.880000 - 0:47:00.880000::When?
0:47:00.880000 - 0:47:02.040000::Okay, but here's the deal.
0:47:02.040000 - 0:47:08.600000::Every time we go there, we go overboard on the food and the chips and salsa, whatever.
0:47:08.600000 - 0:47:11.280000::We go underboard on the beer liquor.
0:47:11.280000 - 0:47:12.280000::The beat is.
0:47:12.280000 - 0:47:13.360000::I want to go one time.
0:47:13.360000 - 0:47:16.640000::I just haven't gotten properly messed up.
0:47:16.640000 - 0:47:17.640000::Stay dead like that.
0:47:17.640000 - 0:47:19.440000::You were driving that night.
0:47:19.440000 - 0:47:20.440000::Well, of course.
0:47:20.440000 - 0:47:21.440000::I couldn't do it.

0:47:24.880000 - 0:47:26.640000::I don't want to drive anywhere.
0:47:26.640000 - 0:47:28.760000::I don't want to drive anywhere.
0:47:28.760000 - 0:47:29.760000::Listen.
0:47:29.760000 - 0:47:31.320000::I want to get a party bus.

0:47:38.400000 - 0:47:40::And it should be in London when we go there.
0:47:40 - 0:47:43.120000::And we're going to London town, we'll get some delicious Indian food.
0:47:43.120000 - 0:47:48.400000::Wherever we're doing this, I want a bottle of liquor at the table.

0:47:51.400000 - 0:47:53::We're not leaving till that shit is done.
0:47:53 - 0:47:58::I imagine if we got Bariat tacos at a bottle of mezcal.
0:47:58.960000 - 0:48:01.480000::And brought our new celebrity friends.
0:48:01.480000 - 0:48:06.480000::Oh, bring the SNL riders room to bride and beach.
0:48:07.480000 - 0:48:09.020000::Get them all vodka out.
0:48:09.020000 - 0:48:12.320000::Putting the brand about how they write that shit.
0:48:12.320000 - 0:48:15.720000::Tell them that we're giving them three milligrams in.
0:48:15.720000 - 0:48:17.720000::It's 24 milligrams, experimental's in.
0:48:17.720000 - 0:48:19.840000::Holy shit, military grades in.
0:48:19.840000 - 0:48:22.360000::Nicotine dose, somebody.
0:48:22.360000 - 0:48:23.200000::They're high.
0:48:23.200000 - 0:48:25.080000::Yeah, this sort of nicotine technology from us
0:48:25.080000 - 0:48:26.480000::at the course that works.
0:48:26.480000 - 0:48:29.360000::What do you think they illegalize things?
0:48:29.360000 - 0:48:32.280000::Yeah, yeah, you're so right.
0:48:32.280000 - 0:48:34.640000::When liquor and weed was illegal,
0:48:34.640000 - 0:48:36.360000::you think that it just didn't exist?
0:48:36.360000 - 0:48:41.360000::No, sir, it existed in a plethora inside of the lungs,
0:48:42.160000 - 0:48:46.520000::the stomach and the bloodstream of the elites.
0:48:46.520000 - 0:48:49.080000::You go up and William Randolph, hers house.
0:48:49.080000 - 0:48:49.920000::Oh, don't make me start.
0:48:49.920000 - 0:48:52.160000::Trust me, his bed was made out of fucking hemp.
0:48:52.160000 - 0:48:53.840000::See, it's my ass.
0:48:53.840000 - 0:48:57.160000::Pilla was made out of Dom Periano.
0:48:58.040000 - 0:49:00.880000::Oh, you know whose house I went to that was busted
0:49:00.880000 - 0:49:03.120000::and it was busted.
0:49:03.120000 - 0:49:04.120000::Jack Blacks.
0:49:04.120000 - 0:49:05.080000::J.P.
0:49:05.080000 - 0:49:06.680000::Burger Morgan Chase's house.
0:49:06.680000 - 0:49:07.720000::What?
0:49:07.720000 - 0:49:09.360000::J.P. Morgan Chase.
0:49:09.360000 - 0:49:10.200000::What do you mean?
0:49:10.200000 - 0:49:11.680000::Or I mean, just J.P. Morgan.
0:49:11.680000 - 0:49:12.520000::What does that mean?
0:49:12.520000 - 0:49:13.360000::The original guy.
0:49:13.360000 - 0:49:14.200000::Yeah, I don't know if Chase.
0:49:14.200000 - 0:49:16.200000::You went to J.P. Morgan's house.
0:49:16.200000 - 0:49:17.560000::The guy who sunk the Titanic.
0:49:17.560000 - 0:49:22::I don't know if it was J.P. Morgan, but I went to one
0:49:22 - 0:49:25.120000::of the old railroad tycoons houses.
0:49:25.120000 - 0:49:25.960000::Himbrin?
0:49:25.960000 - 0:49:28.400000::No, in New York, in Terrytown.
0:49:28.400000 - 0:49:29.960000::There's a giant ass house.
0:49:29.960000 - 0:49:33.120000::I forget which one it was, but this guy was a tea,
0:49:33.120000 - 0:49:37.800000::this guy had more wealth than anybody today has, okay?
0:49:37.800000 - 0:49:39.480000::Okay, if you adjust it for inflation,
0:49:39.480000 - 0:49:41.280000::this guy was like triple the richest,
0:49:41.280000 - 0:49:42.920000::like so crazy fucking rich.
0:49:42.920000 - 0:49:46.800000::Okay, but he didn't, he was some type of Christian
0:49:46.800000 - 0:49:48.640000::that didn't allow music or dancing.
0:49:48.640000 - 0:49:50.360000::There's no piano up in that piece.
0:49:50.360000 - 0:49:52.800000::Could a drunk Christian be a...
0:49:52.800000 - 0:49:54.720000::But he had to write exactly.
0:49:54.720000 - 0:49:56.720000::Because the way that you praise God is through those things.
0:49:56.720000 - 0:49:58.840000::I'm too abusing your body out in all the ways
0:49:58.840000 - 0:50:00::it was designed for dance.

0:50:00 - 0:50:03.240000::in every single way.
0:50:03.240000 - 0:50:05.240000::Grime, but Jesus.
0:50:05.240000 - 0:50:10.600000::Using MIDI controllers to create crazy ass.
0:50:10.600000 - 0:50:12.080000::Speaking in tonn- never mind.
0:50:12.080000 - 0:50:13.840000::Oh, the new MIDI tones.
0:50:13.840000 - 0:50:14.840000::What's that?
0:50:14.840000 - 0:50:17::Speaking of the Holy Spirit,
0:50:17 - 0:50:19::they're the MIDI controllers.
0:50:19 - 0:50:20.640000::The Peter, what's his name?
0:50:20.640000 - 0:50:22.720000::The Peter Frampton Prayer.
0:50:22.720000 - 0:50:24.960000::Wee-wee-wee-wee.
0:50:24.960000 - 0:50:30.960000::The Peter Frampton, that's patriotism.
0:50:30.960000 - 0:50:32.560000::Is self-expression.
0:50:32.560000 - 0:50:36.680000::That's what makes American patriotism.
0:50:36.680000 - 0:50:39.400000::So special is other countries get in line.
0:50:39.400000 - 0:50:41.160000::You go uniform style.
0:50:41.160000 - 0:50:42.240000::I'll be the same.
0:50:42.240000 - 0:50:45.080000::All gray, Soviet Union member.
0:50:45.080000 - 0:50:50.440000::In America, actually patriotism is expressing yourself.
0:50:50.440000 - 0:50:51.440000::Yeah.
0:50:51.440000 - 0:50:52.440000::Being unique.
0:50:52.440000 - 0:50:53.440000::Show off the melting pot.
0:50:53.440000 - 0:50:54.440000::Show up the table.
0:50:54.440000 - 0:50:57.080000::Get a variety with the celery and the beef and the...
0:50:57.080000 - 0:50:58.080000::Get your...
0:50:58.080000 - 0:50:59.400000::Get a Maserati and put the...
0:50:59.400000 - 0:51:02.200000::Get the rap, full rap pinch off of your whole family.
0:51:02.200000 - 0:51:03.200000::How old family tree?
0:51:03.200000 - 0:51:05.200000::Every family footy you got put on your mother-fuckin'
0:51:05.200000 - 0:51:06.200000::whole right.
0:51:06.200000 - 0:51:07.200000::Your neighbor's family.
0:51:07.200000 - 0:51:08.200000::Freak them out.
0:51:08.200000 - 0:51:09.200000::Right.
0:51:09.200000 - 0:51:12.280000::Well, I think we should talk about this.
0:51:12.280000 - 0:51:13.280000::Do you...
0:51:13.280000 - 0:51:15.840000::How far back does your lineage go?
0:51:15.840000 - 0:51:16.840000::America-wise?
0:51:16.840000 - 0:51:17.840000::Like, are you...
0:51:17.840000 - 0:51:20.680000::Do you go back to the Mayflower era?
0:51:20.680000 - 0:51:22.880000::Do you have any Mayflower in your family?
0:51:22.880000 - 0:51:23.880000::That Jack...
0:51:23.880000 - 0:51:26.280000::How far does yours go back?
0:51:26.280000 - 0:51:27.280000::Two.
0:51:27.280000 - 0:51:28.280000::Two?
0:51:28.280000 - 0:51:29.280000::What do you mean?
0:51:29.280000 - 0:51:30.280000::Two?
0:51:30.280000 - 0:51:31.280000::Two decades.
0:51:31.280000 - 0:51:32.280000::Two decades.
0:51:32.280000 - 0:51:33.280000::Two...
0:51:33.280000 - 0:51:34.280000::Two like...
0:51:34.280000 - 0:51:38.080000::19-10 or something?
0:51:38.080000 - 0:51:39.080000::Okay, yeah.
0:51:39.080000 - 0:51:40.880000::I think that's the same.
0:51:40.880000 - 0:51:49.280000::I think the first person in my family to hit America was I think in the late tens.
0:51:49.280000 - 0:51:50.280000::You know what I'm saying?
0:51:50.280000 - 0:51:51.280000::19.
0:51:51.280000 - 0:51:52.280000::What?
0:51:52.280000 - 0:51:53.280000::10.
0:51:53.280000 - 0:51:54.280000::Bra.
0:51:54.280000 - 0:51:55.280000::Bra.
0:51:55.280000 - 0:51:57.280000::You know what that would imply?
0:51:57.280000 - 0:51:58.280000::19-10s.
0:51:58.280000 - 0:52:04.480000::But you know what I was always kind of wrapped up about is that...
0:52:04.480000 - 0:52:10.680000::You know, all of the laws and atrocities that America's...
0:52:10.680000 - 0:52:13.920000::Americans have made in the past of the...
0:52:13.920000 - 0:52:15.760000::With the Constitution, whatever.
0:52:15.760000 - 0:52:17.280000::That pre-1800s area.
0:52:17.280000 - 0:52:21.840000::I'm like a lot of the immigrants that have come here, they had nothing to do with that.
0:52:21.840000 - 0:52:23.280000::And now we have to play by these rules.
0:52:23.280000 - 0:52:24.280000::I know.
0:52:24.280000 - 0:52:26.280000::There should have been a re...
0:52:26.280000 - 0:52:27.280000::A rewriting...
0:52:27.280000 - 0:52:28.280000::You know what I'm saying?
0:52:28.280000 - 0:52:29.280000::Get back me up.
0:52:29.280000 - 0:52:30.280000::There's so many talk, please.
0:52:30.280000 - 0:52:31.280000::So we talk now.
0:52:31.280000 - 0:52:32.280000::Please, so many help me out.
0:52:32.280000 - 0:52:33.280000::I don't know what you're saying.
0:52:33.280000 - 0:52:34.280000::I'm frangking them.
0:52:34.280000 - 0:52:35.280000::I don't know what you're saying.
0:52:35.280000 - 0:52:36.280000::I'm frangking them.
0:52:36.280000 - 0:52:37.280000::I don't know what you're saying.
0:52:37.280000 - 0:52:38.280000::I'm frangking them.
0:52:38.280000 - 0:52:39.280000::I don't know what you're saying.
0:52:39.280000 - 0:52:43.280000::I hate that feeling of doing this especially where it just feels like there's a good...
0:52:43.280000 - 0:52:45.280000::I don't know what I'm fucking talking about.
0:52:45.280000 - 0:52:46.280000::There's a good...
0:52:46.280000 - 0:52:48.280000::I was just trying to be nobody's jumping in.
0:52:48.280000 - 0:52:49.280000::I know.
0:52:49.280000 - 0:52:50.280000::I hate what I'm doing.
0:52:50.280000 - 0:52:51.280000::I hate this fucking heart.
0:52:51.280000 - 0:52:52.280000::Let me piggyback.
0:52:52.280000 - 0:52:53.280000::So what are you saying?
0:52:53.280000 - 0:52:54.280000::I think that one thing that...
0:52:54.280000 - 0:52:56.280000::We need immigrants to come to America.
0:52:56.280000 - 0:52:57.280000::We need immigrants to come to America.
0:52:57.280000 - 0:53:01.280000::And when it wasn't just all the British people, we should have been like, hold up.
0:53:01.280000 - 0:53:02.280000::We need something new.
0:53:02.280000 - 0:53:03.280000::Well, there was dude.
0:53:03.280000 - 0:53:09.280000::There was dude, but it didn't work out well for the people who came in the second wave generation of immigration.
0:53:09.280000 - 0:53:11.280000::Third wave immigration.
0:53:11.280000 - 0:53:14.280000::What happens is they start making more and more laws.
0:53:14.280000 - 0:53:15.280000::Sure they do.
0:53:15.280000 - 0:53:18.280000::Look, they're not so nice to those new people every time they come around.
0:53:18.280000 - 0:53:19.280000::Trust me.
0:53:19.280000 - 0:53:20.280000::Okay.
0:53:20.280000 - 0:53:21.280000::Why no?
0:53:21.280000 - 0:53:22.280000::So what's the whole answer?
0:53:22.280000 - 0:53:25.280000::America's, as I say every episode, America's not a fucking country.
0:53:25.280000 - 0:53:26.280000::It's a fucking marketplace.
0:53:26.280000 - 0:53:28.280000::So what you got to do is if you're going to come...
0:53:28.280000 - 0:53:29.280000::Right.
0:53:29.280000 - 0:53:30.280000::Get ready.
0:53:30.280000 - 0:53:31.280000::Get fucking ready.
0:53:31.280000 - 0:53:32.280000::Because you're not going to be met with open arms.
0:53:32.280000 - 0:53:36.280000::You're going to be met with an open palm with a handshake and a secret fucking knife in their palm.
0:53:36.280000 - 0:53:38.280000::Ready to take you for your whole shit.
0:53:38.280000 - 0:53:39.280000::Trust me.
0:53:39.280000 - 0:53:42.280000::The way your foot is moving so fast, why are you saying this?
0:53:42.280000 - 0:53:43.280000::So fast.
0:53:44.280000 - 0:53:45.280000::Let me get a ride home.
0:53:47.280000 - 0:53:48.280000::Wow.

0:54:54.280000 - 0:54:55.280000::That was pool culture.

0:55:05.840000 - 0:55:09.720000::and you know about a pool that we can go to,
0:55:09.720000 - 0:55:13.200000::let me know because I frankly imagine more pools.
0:55:13.200000 - 0:55:14.520000::You don't wanna go to that pool,
0:55:14.520000 - 0:55:16.080000::whatever somebody's gonna.
0:55:16.080000 - 0:55:16.920000::That's what you think,
0:55:16.920000 - 0:55:19.840000::but when you find out Benny Blancos listen to this,
0:55:19.840000 - 0:55:21.240000::and we get to go up to the hills,
0:55:21.240000 - 0:55:22.680000::and if I can take a skin-eated with him

0:55:29.480000 - 0:55:31.400000::Lord knows we need pools in New York.
0:55:31.400000 - 0:55:33.400000::Cause there's at least a lot of pools out here.
0:55:33.400000 - 0:55:35.840000::You know, I'm gonna gatekeep the pool out of that today
0:55:35.840000 - 0:55:37.320000::because it's free 99.

0:55:48.960000 - 0:55:51.160000::a sort of special stack that you think it helps.
0:55:51.160000 - 0:55:53.680000::Right, dialogue skills.
0:55:53.680000 - 0:55:55.880000::That would be very, very helpful.

0:57:15.880000 - 0:57:17.240000::You shouldn't be breathing that in.
0:57:17.240000 - 0:57:18.400000::Well, you definitely shouldn't be swiping
0:57:18.400000 - 0:57:20.440000::whether you're finger like I did.
0:57:20.440000 - 0:57:24.240000::But having no option of music, driving around all week,

0:57:28.760000 - 0:57:30.280000::Horse and buggy style.
0:57:30.280000 - 0:57:31.280000::It's pretty nice.
0:57:31.280000 - 0:57:32.680000::But even then, they had probably servants playing guitar.
0:57:32.680000 - 0:57:34.320000::It's scary at first, but then you get
0:57:34.320000 - 0:57:39.440000::you adjust to the height of consciousness.
0:57:39.440000 - 0:57:41.760000::Wow.

0:57:45.840000 - 0:57:46.840000::We're not time.
0:57:46.840000 - 0:57:47.640000::What's my order?

0:57:55.600000 - 0:57:59.640000::What gave me joy was when we were in the car together
0:57:59.640000 - 0:58:03.120000::and we were just all seeing songs that we knew.
0:58:03.120000 - 0:58:04::And wrapping songs.

0:58:14.360000 - 0:58:15.320000::Exactly.
0:58:15.320000 - 0:58:18.120000::Oh, I wish it'd be the same as an anti-Semitic,
0:58:18.120000 - 0:58:19.920000::but apologize.
0:58:19.920000 - 0:58:20.120000::Oh, no.
0:58:20.120000 - 0:58:21.160000::I wish it wasn't.
0:58:21.160000 - 0:58:22.840000::Yeah, I don't know what I was saying.
0:58:22.840000 - 0:58:23.840000::No, I don't like that.
0:58:23.840000 - 0:58:24.680000::I don't.
