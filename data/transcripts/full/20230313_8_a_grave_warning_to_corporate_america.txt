0:01:17.640000 - 0:01:18.560000::That Harry Potter word.

0:01:23.200000 - 0:01:26.960000::But just know every night, it's fucking a different type
0:01:26.960000 - 0:01:31.080000::of mega famous mega celebrity type person.
0:01:31.080000 - 0:01:34.040000::And I wish I could hang out with regular ass people.
0:01:34.040000 - 0:01:36.240000::Like I wish I could go back to that.
0:01:36.240000 - 0:01:41::But it's just that you just can't relate really to their type of lives.
0:01:41 - 0:01:42.440000::And I don't know.
0:01:42.440000 - 0:01:45.880000::Do you, would you, would you agree with this?
0:01:45.880000 - 0:01:47.600000::I'm so sincerely sincerely.
0:01:47.600000 - 0:01:51.720000::Here's what I do because I hear like, listen, we're so in this shit now.
0:01:51.720000 - 0:01:54.640000::We're meeting people that are climbing the industry.
0:01:54.640000 - 0:01:58.480000::The only reason they're climbing faster than us is their social clients.
0:01:58.480000 - 0:01:59.480000::Right.
0:01:59.480000 - 0:02:00.480000::And we don't care about that.
0:02:00.480000 - 0:02:01.480000::We don't have to climb.
0:02:01.480000 - 0:02:07.160000::We sit at a nice table with fresh wine and good projects.
0:02:07.160000 - 0:02:09.720000::And that, we don't have to climb to get to the famous people.
0:02:09.720000 - 0:02:10.720000::Guess what?
0:02:10.720000 - 0:02:12.520000::The famous people come to our table.
0:02:12.520000 - 0:02:15.320000::And they break bread with us and they like us for that.
0:02:15.320000 - 0:02:18.320000::And we meet more famous people than the social climbers would be.
0:02:18.320000 - 0:02:22.440000::Some people, some people socially, they're social climbers.
0:02:22.440000 - 0:02:28.040000::What we call social, what's like an opposite of climbers.
0:02:28.040000 - 0:02:33.680000::Social, social, no like social track athletes.
0:02:33.680000 - 0:02:37.040000::Social, social, like it, or social lights.
0:02:37.040000 - 0:02:39.120000::But we're not, we're not climbing it.
0:02:39.120000 - 0:02:41.280000::We are, we are, we are kind of crab walking.
0:02:41.280000 - 0:02:42.280000::Let me break this down.
0:02:42.280000 - 0:02:47.760000::Look, well, hold on a sec, because climbers what they're doing is they're using the rock
0:02:47.760000 - 0:02:49::instead of respecting it.
0:02:49 - 0:02:52.080000::So what we're doing is we are social worshipers.
0:02:52.080000 - 0:02:55.680000::We worship and hold sacred the rock of sociality.
0:02:55.680000 - 0:02:56.680000::Does that make sense?
0:02:56.680000 - 0:02:57.680000::I hate to preach this early.
0:02:57.680000 - 0:02:58.680000::We put dinners.
0:02:58.680000 - 0:03:00.480000::The amount of time that I say, hey, let's get dinners.
0:03:00.480000 - 0:03:04.520000::Yo, me, me you and so and so from this, whatever show from this network.
0:03:04.520000 - 0:03:05.920000::We shall get dinner soon.
0:03:05.920000 - 0:03:08.080000::Eric, yeah, that sounds good, Eric.
0:03:08.080000 - 0:03:10.440000::All right, I'm not going to be bullshitin' about it.
0:03:10.440000 - 0:03:11.440000::That night, group you.
0:03:11.440000 - 0:03:12.440000::You've had them.
0:03:12.440000 - 0:03:14.120000::Hey, yo, I was thinking we all get dinner soon.
0:03:14.120000 - 0:03:17.360000::My treat that I organized it and we all split the bill.
0:03:17.360000 - 0:03:18.680000::It's split the bill.
0:03:18.680000 - 0:03:19.680000::Wait.
0:03:19.680000 - 0:03:22.040000::Eric, you've had more dinners than some people have had.
0:03:22.040000 - 0:03:23.040000::More meals.
0:03:23.040000 - 0:03:29.640000::Well, I'm aware of that and I'm aware of my privilege in ways that would depress most
0:03:29.640000 - 0:03:30.640000::people.
0:03:30.640000 - 0:03:34.240000::Is that I'm so aware of my privilege that I'm like sometimes paralyzed by it.
0:03:34.240000 - 0:03:35.240000::Right.
0:03:35.240000 - 0:03:36.240000::Paras social paralysis.
0:03:36.240000 - 0:03:37.240000::Paras social paralysis.
0:03:37.240000 - 0:03:38.240000::Yeah.
0:03:38.240000 - 0:03:40.240000::Oh, I wanted to say this.
0:03:40.240000 - 0:03:41.240000::All right.
0:03:41.240000 - 0:03:47.120000::Hey, yo, if you recognize us in public, listen.
0:03:47.120000 - 0:03:51.840000::Pictures that you show your friends, it will impress them.
0:03:51.840000 - 0:03:56.320000::For a time, if someone recognizes you jack in public or any other celebrity, I'm just
0:03:56.320000 - 0:03:57.800000::teaching everybody some etiquette.
0:03:57.800000 - 0:03:58.800000::Okay.
0:03:58.800000 - 0:04:02.240000::Listen, you might want to get the picture to show your friends, I guess who I fucking saw
0:04:02.240000 - 0:04:05.960000::in New York City all dripped out with their jewelry all hanging out with them.
0:04:05.960000 - 0:04:09.160000::I saw someone saw Eric Ray, whoever Jack Benz and your neighbor on an eye.
0:04:09.160000 - 0:04:11.440000::Tom and Gachi hanging out there zipper.
0:04:11.440000 - 0:04:14.040000::But and they want the picture for the status.
0:04:14.040000 - 0:04:15.040000::Guess what?
0:04:15.040000 - 0:04:16.040000::Someone asked me for a picture.
0:04:16.040000 - 0:04:21.800000::I took my hand politely and I smacked their phone gently down away from my face.
0:04:21.800000 - 0:04:25.680000::And I said, I don't do pictures, but I had to stick out my hand.
0:04:25.680000 - 0:04:26.680000::My name's Eric.
0:04:26.680000 - 0:04:27.680000::What's yours?
0:04:27.680000 - 0:04:28.680000::Oh my.
0:04:28.680000 - 0:04:29.680000::Shake the hands, squeeze the hand.
0:04:29.680000 - 0:04:30.680000::Where are you from?
0:04:30.680000 - 0:04:31.680000::Feel their heartbeat in their palm on your hands.
0:04:31.680000 - 0:04:34::What's something horrible that happened to you or not, whatever.
0:04:34 - 0:04:37::I'm trying to get another quick, what's something human that is about you.
0:04:37 - 0:04:41.160000::I can know whether it's drugs or whether it's art painting.
0:04:41.160000 - 0:04:45.840000::And that I find initially they're all bummed together, not in their picture.
0:04:45.840000 - 0:04:47.480000::Pretty quickly, I took that.
0:04:47.480000 - 0:04:51.480000::They're like, yo, I just had an amazing conversation with Eric Rayle where before I would
0:04:51.480000 - 0:04:53.720000::just got in a picture and gone home all satisfied.
0:04:53.720000 - 0:04:56.360000::Because I saw how good he was living on a new idea.
0:04:56.360000 - 0:04:57.360000::You know what?
0:04:57.360000 - 0:04:59.960000::That reminds me of a conversation that I had with Tony Hawk.

0:05:00 - 0:05:01::I already talked about this on the podcast.
0:05:01 - 0:05:04.120000::You haven't, but I saw Tony Hawk and this is legit.
0:05:04.120000 - 0:05:06.680000::Everybody was taking pictures with Tony Hawk.
0:05:06.680000 - 0:05:08.320000::And you know what, and you know, I'm a skateboarder.
0:05:08.320000 - 0:05:10.160000::You guys can I say this, Molly kick foot, Molly,
0:05:10.160000 - 0:05:11::you'll flip.
0:05:11 - 0:05:12::All right.
0:05:12 - 0:05:13.640000::I want to preface this by sometimes we're joking around
0:05:13.640000 - 0:05:15::on the podcast.
0:05:15 - 0:05:17.240000::We say things that sound fake.
0:05:17.240000 - 0:05:19.760000::They're usually real sometimes or not.
0:05:19.760000 - 0:05:21.800000::This is a real story.
0:05:21.800000 - 0:05:23.800000::I saw Jack talking to Tony Hawk.
0:05:23.800000 - 0:05:25.600000::It's verified and I might be.
0:05:25.600000 - 0:05:27.920000::Yeah, because yeah, that's that is crucial
0:05:27.920000 - 0:05:29.840000::because I say a lot of I sound like
0:05:29.840000 - 0:05:31.040000::this is a real story.
0:05:31.040000 - 0:05:32.040000::So I'm talking to Tony Hawk.
0:05:32.040000 - 0:05:33.040000::Everybody's taking pictures.
0:05:33.040000 - 0:05:34.040000::Hey, man, what's up?
0:05:34.040000 - 0:05:35.880000::And you know me, I'm like, I just said about 18 seconds ago,
0:05:35.880000 - 0:05:37.360000::I'm a skateboarder and I'll be good for Molly
0:05:37.360000 - 0:05:38.560000::back heel, fakey tray.
0:05:38.560000 - 0:05:39.560000::I got it all.
0:05:39.560000 - 0:05:40.560000::If you know what I'm saying, you know what I'm saying?
0:05:40.560000 - 0:05:42.560000::I mean, Mark Eppeljard, Mark Johnson,
0:05:42.560000 - 0:05:44.120000::need I say more.
0:05:44.120000 - 0:05:44.880000::Carl's bad.
0:05:44.880000 - 0:05:45.560000::All right.
0:05:45.560000 - 0:05:49.920000::So instead of taking a picture, what I do is I go up to him.
0:05:49.920000 - 0:05:51.120000::I know he's had surgery recently.
0:05:51.120000 - 0:05:52.280000::I said, how's the surgery going?
0:05:52.280000 - 0:05:53.400000::And he said, oh, it's going good.
0:05:53.400000 - 0:05:55.320000::And I said, hopefully they didn't leave anything,
0:05:55.320000 - 0:05:57.960000::do put anything weird in your body.
0:05:57.960000 - 0:05:59.520000::And that's realized them.
0:05:59.520000 - 0:06:02.840000::Well, what's funny is I was panicking so crazy hard
0:06:02.840000 - 0:06:05.440000::about what to say that I said that.
0:06:05.440000 - 0:06:06.840000::And he kind of laughed a little bit,
0:06:06.840000 - 0:06:09.960000::but then he did stop talking to me probably two or three
0:06:09.960000 - 0:06:10.720000::sentences later.
0:06:10.720000 - 0:06:12::But you know what?
0:06:12 - 0:06:15.080000::Credit to him because he handled it so well.
0:06:15.080000 - 0:06:18.600000::He handled my dumbass incredibly well where he laughed
0:06:18.600000 - 0:06:19.280000::about it.
0:06:19.280000 - 0:06:20.440000::He said instantly.
0:06:20.440000 - 0:06:21.440000::He said, you know what?
0:06:21.440000 - 0:06:23.960000::As long as they fixed me, they can mess with me.
0:06:23.960000 - 0:06:25.280000::However they do.
0:06:25.280000 - 0:06:27.040000::Jack, do you know what?
0:06:27.040000 - 0:06:29.880000::Celebrities like more than anything on the planet
0:06:29.880000 - 0:06:32.560000::when you first meet them?
0:06:32.560000 - 0:06:35.960000::No, they want this more than, and I don't know.
0:06:35.960000 - 0:06:39.080000::You guys might disagree with this, but I think what they really
0:06:39.080000 - 0:06:44.400000::want is if you're meeting them for the very first time,
0:06:44.400000 - 0:06:46.960000::you go up to Tony Hawk and you say, hey, I'm a podcaster.
0:06:46.960000 - 0:06:47.480000::I love you.
0:06:47.480000 - 0:06:49.840000::I love to have your ass on the podcast.
0:06:49.840000 - 0:06:51.040000::I'll be having on some of that.
0:06:51.040000 - 0:06:52.040000::That's a good point.
0:06:52.040000 - 0:06:53.280000::I'm paid by the way.
0:06:53.280000 - 0:06:53.800000::Paid.
0:06:53.800000 - 0:06:54.280000::Paid.
0:06:54.280000 - 0:06:55.960000::Paid a lot of money.
0:06:55.960000 - 0:06:59.080000::More than we're going into debt so hard by promising.
0:06:59.080000 - 0:07:00.080000::Audience.
0:07:00.080000 - 0:07:01.120000::I love that.
0:07:01.120000 - 0:07:03.120000::It gives me something to work towards.
0:07:03.120000 - 0:07:06.400000::Yo, yeah, hold about $100 bill in front of Tony Hawk.
0:07:06.400000 - 0:07:07.720000::You like this, right?
0:07:07.720000 - 0:07:09.280000::Don't you like, I know you got a lot of this.
0:07:09.280000 - 0:07:10.320000::You want a little more of this.
0:07:10.320000 - 0:07:11.320000::Yeah, you want to do it.
0:07:11.320000 - 0:07:12.160000::You want to do it.
0:07:12.160000 - 0:07:13.800000::Yeah, you want to come to my house.
0:07:13.800000 - 0:07:14.640000::Come to my house.
0:07:14.640000 - 0:07:16.240000::Come to my house, sit on the couch and talk to me
0:07:16.240000 - 0:07:21.520000::and Eric and smell our food that we cook.
0:07:21.520000 - 0:07:23.800000::Yeah, Tony Hawk liked me a lot.
0:07:23.800000 - 0:07:26.040000::I want to say that Nate.
0:07:26.040000 - 0:07:27.040000::Nate's on Zoom right now.
0:07:27.040000 - 0:07:29.040000::He's on Zoom right now.
0:07:29.040000 - 0:07:30.960000::If you're listening to the podcast, yeah, yes.
0:07:30.960000 - 0:07:31.960000::Oh, yeah.
0:07:31.960000 - 0:07:32.960000::You're crazy set up.
0:07:32.960000 - 0:07:33.960000::Sorry, I got it.
0:07:33.960000 - 0:07:34.960000::Sure.
0:07:34.960000 - 0:07:36.760000::Well, you put it together, man, so I feel like it's on you.
0:07:36.760000 - 0:07:37.720000::Is that what you're going to say?
0:07:37.720000 - 0:07:38.240000::Yeah.
0:07:38.240000 - 0:07:38.720000::Oh, OK.
0:07:38.720000 - 0:07:39.720000::So it's on me.
0:07:39.720000 - 0:07:42.200000::So what it is is we thought we'd
0:07:42.200000 - 0:07:43.560000::want to deliver some video content.
0:07:43.560000 - 0:07:46.280000::So I thought, why don't we set up the camera?
0:07:46.280000 - 0:07:51.600000::So we have the camera that is filming us with Eric and I
0:07:51.600000 - 0:07:54.600000::on either side of a Nate on a giant Zoom in the middle.
0:07:54.600000 - 0:07:56.960000::And then my work computer has a little graphic up.
0:07:56.960000 - 0:07:58.200000::That's kind of cute.
0:07:58.200000 - 0:08:02.360000::And so we're recording audio to two different computers.
0:08:02.360000 - 0:08:04.680000::We got a light.
0:08:04.680000 - 0:08:07.800000::You know what I cannot wait for is 10 years down the road.
0:08:07.800000 - 0:08:08.800000::No, this ties into this.
0:08:08.800000 - 0:08:10.320000::Listen, listen.
0:08:10.320000 - 0:08:10.920000::Ties into this.
0:08:10.920000 - 0:08:11.320000::I swear.
0:08:11.320000 - 0:08:13.600000::I just thought it would be so much more complicated sounding,
0:08:13.600000 - 0:08:15.560000::but it actually sounds like a fresh.
0:08:15.560000 - 0:08:17.360000::I mean, Jack, and guess what?
0:08:17.360000 - 0:08:19.200000::I was like, oh, how is this going to work?
0:08:19.200000 - 0:08:21.840000::I literally, Jack is thinking like this.
0:08:21.840000 - 0:08:23.600000::Just this, this, put the mics like this.
0:08:23.600000 - 0:08:27.520000::So I'm like on this computer, but the camera here, whatever.
0:08:27.520000 - 0:08:29.680000::You've got a brain that works differently than people
0:08:29.680000 - 0:08:31.880000::in a lot of in some good ways, man.
0:08:31.880000 - 0:08:34.440000::Because it doesn't work in the ways that everybody else does.
0:08:34.440000 - 0:08:38.120000::But in the places where my comprehension skills fail me,
0:08:38.120000 - 0:08:40.120000::my creativity fills in the gaps in a way
0:08:40.120000 - 0:08:42.600000::that I get to the answer that everybody else gets to,
0:08:42.600000 - 0:08:44.800000::but it takes me just as long as I'm not on.
0:08:44.800000 - 0:08:48.440000::I think you are going to die of being too creative.
0:08:48.560000 - 0:08:49.320000::That's going to be gone.
0:08:49.320000 - 0:08:53.920000::You're like, like, cause of death, creativity, somehow.
0:08:53.920000 - 0:08:56.080000::I do feel like I'm not kidding.
0:08:56.080000 - 0:08:58::I think I had that thought this week.
0:08:58 - 0:09:00.280000::You kind of do get creative with food and-
0:09:00.280000 - 0:09:02.520000::You're becoming too creative, I think.
0:09:02.520000 - 0:09:03.800000::It's to the point where it's a problem.
0:09:03.800000 - 0:09:04.720000::I do.
0:09:05.720000 - 0:09:08.040000::I got a little too creative with some ground turkey
0:09:08.040000 - 0:09:10.040000::one time, and I'm never going to try and cook that again.
0:09:10.040000 - 0:09:12::That was the most twisted looking.
0:09:12 - 0:09:13.240000::That was really scary.
0:09:13.240000 - 0:09:15.040000::I should have known right away with the pinkness
0:09:15.040000 - 0:09:15.880000::that it wasn't done.
0:09:15.880000 - 0:09:18.760000::That's going on the slideshow on Instagram.
0:09:18.760000 - 0:09:20::I have a lot of-
0:09:20 - 0:09:21.240000::So according to that.
0:09:21.240000 - 0:09:23.480000::I have pretty much every meal I cooked over the pandemic.
0:09:23.480000 - 0:09:24.560000::I have pictures of.
0:09:24.560000 - 0:09:25.400000::Really?
0:09:25.400000 - 0:09:26.240000::And they're not great.
0:09:26.240000 - 0:09:28.240000::I got my cooking right, and I don't want to take-
0:09:28.240000 - 0:09:29.480000::Go ahead, you and start playing with it.
0:09:29.480000 - 0:09:30.320000::No, you get-
0:09:30.320000 - 0:09:31.480000::I got my cooking kind of right in the pandemic.
0:09:31.480000 - 0:09:32.560000::Really?
0:09:32.560000 - 0:09:33.880000::It is crazy, I know.
0:09:33.880000 - 0:09:36.520000::What's that red light blinking for?
0:09:37.520000 - 0:09:38.280000::I was just going to ask you,
0:09:38.280000 - 0:09:40.520000::remember when I made that stew?
0:09:40.520000 - 0:09:42::That stew was really good.
0:09:42 - 0:09:42.840000::That stew.
0:09:43.840000 - 0:09:45.720000::Well, and if you don't know what that is,
0:09:45.720000 - 0:09:47.320000::you know what the stew is?
0:09:47.320000 - 0:09:51.160000::I know what A-stew is, but I don't know what the stew is.
0:09:51.160000 - 0:09:54.560000::This was a viral sort of recipe.
0:09:54.560000 - 0:09:59.960000::Chickpeas all mushed up with spinach, coconut milk, curry.

0:10:00 - 0:10:05::and it was, I ate it basically almost every week.
0:10:05 - 0:10:07.280000::I was obsessed with Alston Romans, the stew.
0:10:07.280000 - 0:10:08.120000::Oh, okay.
0:10:08.120000 - 0:10:09.560000::And then one time I used to them raw,
0:10:09.560000 - 0:10:11.320000::basically I think it was rotten kale.
0:10:11.320000 - 0:10:13.920000::When we couldn't, I didn't know it.
0:10:13.920000 - 0:10:17.320000::And the stew made me, gave me food poisoning and I knew it since.
0:10:17.320000 - 0:10:19.200000::When does food, you know how there,
0:10:19.200000 - 0:10:21.400000::we've had like kind of a,
0:10:21.400000 - 0:10:26.400000::we've opened up the topic of when food goes bad.
0:10:26.400000 - 0:10:28.680000::Like, you know what's that imperfect foods
0:10:28.680000 - 0:10:30.520000::that drops off?
0:10:30.520000 - 0:10:32.240000::Yes, the grocery store.
0:10:32.240000 - 0:10:33.120000::So there's like,
0:10:33.120000 - 0:10:38.120000::or the service now that will send out food
0:10:38.120000 - 0:10:40.280000::that has like brown spots on it.
0:10:40.280000 - 0:10:44.600000::And I feel like the dialogue has been reopened up for
0:10:44.600000 - 0:10:47.200000::when a food goes bad or not.
0:10:47.200000 - 0:10:51::So I don't know when something actually really is gonna
0:10:51 - 0:10:53.760000::take you out type of bad because.
0:10:53.760000 - 0:10:56.720000::This is, this like, as you could see,
0:10:56.720000 - 0:10:57.880000::I'm greeting my teeth like,
0:10:57.880000 - 0:11:01.080000::skittin' so fucking mad because guess what?
0:11:01.080000 - 0:11:01.920000::You mad, bro?
0:11:01.920000 - 0:11:05.720000::We can eat the food way past the expiration dates.
0:11:05.720000 - 0:11:06.560000::Of course.
0:11:06.560000 - 0:11:07.560000::Listen, another thing,
0:11:07.560000 - 0:11:11.200000::they're putting bugs in our phones to make them die earlier.
0:11:11.200000 - 0:11:13.320000::So we buy the new model.
0:11:13.320000 - 0:11:16.080000::We are being crushed by the corporations.
0:11:16.080000 - 0:11:17.720000::They think they can throw it around,
0:11:17.720000 - 0:11:18.920000::take advantage of us.
0:11:18.920000 - 0:11:20.280000::But guess what?
0:11:20.280000 - 0:11:23.800000::Us as a planet is becoming more technologically literate.
0:11:24.800000 - 0:11:28.200000::We are becoming able to resist and fight back.
0:11:28.200000 - 0:11:30.280000::And if these corporations think they can continue
0:11:30.280000 - 0:11:31.640000::to take advantage of us like this,
0:11:31.640000 - 0:11:34.360000::they are wrong and the guillotine will be coming back.
0:11:34.360000 - 0:11:37::Sooner than you think, violence is coming for those
0:11:37 - 0:11:38.760000::who thought they could take advantage of the week.
0:11:38.760000 - 0:11:39.600000::And guess what?
0:11:39.600000 - 0:11:40.600000::I might not be the leader.
0:11:40.600000 - 0:11:43::I might be dead too quick after the first rebellion.
0:11:43 - 0:11:44.320000::But y'all are going soon.
0:11:44.320000 - 0:11:46.680000::So start shaking your boots and start or start
0:11:46.680000 - 0:11:48::giving your money back because you can't
0:11:48 - 0:11:49.640000::have your cake and eat it too, bitch.
0:11:49.640000 - 0:11:50.640000::Oh my God.
0:11:50.640000 - 0:11:54.440000::This is a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.
0:11:54.440000 - 0:11:57.440000::Dude, I would legit, I would go to war for you.
0:11:57.440000 - 0:11:58.440000::Would you really come?
0:11:58.440000 - 0:11:59.440000::You are.
0:11:59.440000 - 0:12:03.600000::You are going to 100% be the first death in the rebellion.
0:12:03.600000 - 0:12:05.760000::Like you're going to be, you will, I think.
0:12:05.760000 - 0:12:08.400000::Oh, Eric, you're going to be, you think so?
0:12:08.400000 - 0:12:09.600000::The coups going to happen and you're
0:12:09.600000 - 0:12:11.160000::going to be chilling up in the library.
0:12:11.160000 - 0:12:13.120000::And they're going to cut your ears off
0:12:13.120000 - 0:12:15.200000::and drag you into a football stadium.
0:12:15.200000 - 0:12:17.320000::And they're going to make everybody sit on their knees
0:12:17.320000 - 0:12:18.680000::and watch as they torture you one time.
0:12:18.680000 - 0:12:20.160000::But that's going to spark the movement.
0:12:20.480000 - 0:12:22.320000::They're going to grote me.
0:12:22.320000 - 0:12:23.160000::Say it again.
0:12:23.160000 - 0:12:24::They're going to grote me.
0:12:24 - 0:12:25.160000::What's that?
0:12:25.160000 - 0:12:27.680000::It's like a serrated military knife.
0:12:27.680000 - 0:12:28.680000::It's horrible.
0:12:28.680000 - 0:12:29.520000::Oh, grote.
0:12:29.520000 - 0:12:32.120000::Or maybe grote is with a, I don't want to go into it.
0:12:32.120000 - 0:12:34.280000::Maybe grote is just the piano.
0:12:34.280000 - 0:12:35.600000::Well, don't do that.
0:12:35.600000 - 0:12:36.920000::Whoever's going to do that to you.
0:12:36.920000 - 0:12:38.520000::But don't do that.
0:12:38.520000 - 0:12:39.760000::It's going to be the American.
0:12:39.760000 - 0:12:40.680000::And watch what happens.
0:12:40.680000 - 0:12:43.680000::Watch the dominoes that begin to fall upon my death.
0:12:43.680000 - 0:12:46.760000::And maybe my death was always needed to kick it off.
0:12:46.760000 - 0:12:47.520000::God dang, man.
0:12:47.520000 - 0:12:49.320000::I want to just like, you like that.
0:12:49.320000 - 0:12:51.480000::Well, I want to give you like more things to it.
0:12:51.480000 - 0:12:53.120000::What do people need to be inspired on?
0:12:53.120000 - 0:12:53.960000::I feel like.
0:12:53.960000 - 0:12:54.960000::I don't know.
0:12:54.960000 - 0:12:55.800000::All right.
0:12:55.800000 - 0:12:57.160000::So give a speech like, yeah.
0:12:57.160000 - 0:12:58.600000::I don't know if I can get that energy back.
0:12:58.600000 - 0:12:59.100000::Oh, OK.
0:12:59.100000 - 0:13:00.040000::I might need to sit.
0:13:00.040000 - 0:13:01.120000::It might come back naturally.
0:13:01.120000 - 0:13:02.880000::But that kind of took it out of me.
0:13:02.880000 - 0:13:04.760000::I feel like, let me try that.
0:13:04.760000 - 0:13:07::Let me try that because I like to think of myself as a leader.
0:13:07 - 0:13:08.920000::What was the topic that you just did it on?
0:13:08.920000 - 0:13:11.280000::I did it on sort of corruption, corporate greed.
0:13:11.280000 - 0:13:11.440000::All right.
0:13:11.440000 - 0:13:12.880000::Let me try.
0:13:12.880000 - 0:13:15::Let me try.
0:13:15 - 0:13:17.280000::So back in the day, there used to be nobody
0:13:17.280000 - 0:13:18.400000::who would stop you and block you
0:13:18.400000 - 0:13:20.480000::when you would go down to the water and catch a fish.
0:13:20.480000 - 0:13:24.360000::But these days, it seems like every piece of land
0:13:24.360000 - 0:13:25.960000::in the whole country is now blocked off
0:13:25.960000 - 0:13:27.400000::by some governmental fence.
0:13:27.400000 - 0:13:28.240000::What the fuck?
0:13:28.240000 - 0:13:29.360000::Whose company's behind that?
0:13:29.360000 - 0:13:30.040000::Who's getting this?
0:13:30.040000 - 0:13:31.400000::Should be the people that get to decide
0:13:31.400000 - 0:13:32.920000::where's what fence is going blocking off
0:13:32.920000 - 0:13:34.640000::what water?
0:13:34.640000 - 0:13:35.480000::Bitch.
0:13:35.480000 - 0:13:36.880000::Oh, that's it.
0:13:36.880000 - 0:13:37.880000::There we go.
0:13:37.880000 - 0:13:40.280000::You need to be like, uh, speech writers, I think.
0:13:40.280000 - 0:13:43.880000::Like, this is, this is like, uh, when I heard Obama had
0:13:43.880000 - 0:13:46.280000::a speech writer, first off, I was disappointed.
0:13:46.320000 - 0:13:48.520000::Then how is my interest was peaked?
0:13:48.520000 - 0:13:50.920000::Because I thought that sounds like the most best job
0:13:50.920000 - 0:13:52.360000::on the planet.
0:13:52.360000 - 0:13:53.360000::Do you know that my,
0:13:53.360000 - 0:13:54.600000::what again, Obama's the writer's.
0:13:54.600000 - 0:13:58.360000::My agent's, um, uh, husband, whoa, whoa, whoa.
0:13:58.360000 - 0:14:01.120000::We haven't talked about the reps yet, but sure, go for it.
0:14:01.120000 - 0:14:02.760000::I think we didn't do it.
0:14:02.760000 - 0:14:04.760000::We haven't, this is the first time in the podcast
0:14:04.760000 - 0:14:05.600000::we're talking about.
0:14:05.600000 - 0:14:06.760000::Representation.
0:14:08 - 0:14:09.600000::Yes, I do have an agent.
0:14:09.600000 - 0:14:10.600000::Oh, shit.
0:14:10.600000 - 0:14:12.120000::Oh my god.
0:14:12.120000 - 0:14:13.800000::Gun locked out.
0:14:14.800000 - 0:14:15.800000::Oh god.
0:14:15.800000 - 0:14:16.800000::Damn.
0:14:16.800000 - 0:14:17.800000::Stop.
0:14:17.800000 - 0:14:18.800000::All right.
0:14:18.800000 - 0:14:19.800000::Sorry, sorry, sorry.
0:14:19.800000 - 0:14:24.440000::No, but my, my agent's, um, husband was a speech writer
0:14:24.440000 - 0:14:28.800000::for like one president or something back in the 80s.
0:14:28.800000 - 0:14:29.800000::For who?
0:14:29.800000 - 0:14:30.800000::For who, man?
0:14:30.800000 - 0:14:31.800000::Phil Moe.
0:14:31.800000 - 0:14:32.800000::Just, I mean, there were only a couple of presidents.
0:14:32.800000 - 0:14:33.800000::Exactly.
0:14:33.800000 - 0:14:34.800000::Yes.
0:14:34.800000 - 0:14:35.800000::Reagan, Nixen.
0:14:35.800000 - 0:14:36.800000::Nixen.
0:14:36.800000 - 0:14:37.800000::Bush.
0:14:37.800000 - 0:14:38.800000::I don't want to adopt this person.
0:14:38.800000 - 0:14:39.800000::No, no.
0:14:39.800000 - 0:14:40.800000::Truman.
0:14:40.800000 - 0:14:41.800000::Wait, with the 80s?
0:14:41.800000 - 0:14:42.800000::The 80s, yeah.
0:14:42.800000 - 0:14:43.800000::We got Jimmy Carter.
0:14:43.800000 - 0:14:44.800000::You can't dox a president.
0:14:44.800000 - 0:14:48.800000::And you know, the Ronald Reagan living the White House.
0:14:48.800000 - 0:14:49.800000::Bush senior.
0:14:49.800000 - 0:14:52.800000::It was a, wait, was it, we don't, I don't look it up.
0:14:52.800000 - 0:14:53.800000::There's no way to know.
0:14:53.800000 - 0:14:55.800000::Jimmy Carter, Gerald Ford, Carter.
0:14:55.800000 - 0:14:58.800000::Nobody knows what the Reagan nobody knows.
0:14:58.800000 - 0:14:59.800000::Oh, my god.

0:15:00 - 0:15:04.300000::I guess nobody knows and y'all didn't sign up for this podcast
0:15:05 - 0:15:09.340000::It kind of threw me off when you told me this Eric, but can you please?
0:15:10.080000 - 0:15:13.840000::Let the people know what type of information you just heard regarding
0:15:14.440000 - 0:15:20.680000::Are one of our favorite topics to talk about and one of the favorite topics for everybody in the world right now to talk about
0:15:20.680000 - 0:15:25.740000::Which is aliens so Eric you please take it away with this earth shattering life changing
0:15:25.740000 - 0:15:27.900000::I'll start it. I'll start it off with this
0:15:28.540000 - 0:15:36.080000::I'm no expert. I don't know if this is all to be true. I'm not a scientist, but what I hear I am beginning
0:15:37.060000 - 0:15:42.900000::It's so weird. There's so many there's agents of chaos when it comes to the disclosure of information about aliens
0:15:42.900000 - 0:15:46.340000::You have the guess it's we're in a weird point in time
0:15:47.300000 - 0:15:54.580000::Where when the government says there are aliens you don't want to believe them and with the conspiracies theorists say there aren't aliens
0:15:54.580000 - 0:15:56.720000::You want to believe them you see what I mean?
0:15:56.720000 - 0:16:02.520000::Well, it's interesting because it seems like when the government says there's an alien that means that they are hiding a
0:16:03.060000 - 0:16:04.300000::governmental
0:16:04.300000 - 0:16:08.540000::Invasion, but when there is a government but when there's a we hear about the invasion it means they're hiding aliens
0:16:08.540000 - 0:16:13.340000::So at a certain point are they hiding something even worse than both of those things
0:16:14.060000 - 0:16:22.860000::Here's a thing there be even be something like that my thoughts on the nature of man is that man cannot hold in a secret like this throughout many
0:16:23.220000 - 0:16:24.220000::administrations
0:16:25.220000 - 0:16:31.020000::Unless there's unless I'm getting something wrong about people's sense of duty to their country in secrecy
0:16:31.380000 - 0:16:39::But if we're saying that Roswell happened in the 1940s and oh there they're doing secret projects on the aliens underground and munkers
0:16:39.660000 - 0:16:45.780000::I'm starting to think can can you really keep that secret for almost I know 80 years
0:16:45.780000 - 0:16:49.420000::Do you want to know how you can? Here's how you can keep that secret how how
0:16:49.420000 - 0:16:51.420000::Oh
0:16:51.420000 - 0:16:57.100000::Through death and violence my people oh soon as somebody knows you slip some pill that makes their mind go crazy
0:16:57.100000 - 0:17:00.940000::This is what I've been saying about the moon landing because I had to say it
0:17:00.940000 - 0:17:04.900000::I don't know if that happened because you're telling me that when did that happen 1969?
0:17:05.660000 - 0:17:07.740000::Correct right, yeah, you have
0:17:07.740000 - 0:17:13.960000::You convinced me of this the the moon what I was like didn't because you're you're like we haven't gone back to the moon
0:17:13.960000 - 0:17:19.380000::Why have we gone back to the moon since we haven't been back since 1969 you're telling me that that man
0:17:19.420000 - 0:17:24.900000::Went on the moon and since then I can now go to the grocery store and get go to jang sauce like this if I want
0:17:24.900000 - 0:17:28.140000::We've moved so far technologically in so many ways as a globe
0:17:28.660000 - 0:17:32.140000::You're telling me not only us but nobody has been back to the moon
0:17:32.420000 - 0:17:35.140000::It just makes me want to go up to somebody's door not on it
0:17:35.140000 - 0:17:38.680000::I'm gonna open it up and say cap what let me count through that
0:17:38.680000 - 0:17:42.940000::Just moment I wish you would because I don't get countered normally because people are so afraid of me
0:17:43.300000 - 0:17:45.600000::Speaking on human nature and how we got to the moon
0:17:45.600000 - 0:17:50.700000::I believe we have the science to achieve this and I believe that we did go to the moon. Okay. I though
0:17:51.200000 - 0:17:54.900000::The why idea of whether or not we're able to stream back the
0:17:55.360000 - 0:18:01.140000::The footage to TV live from the moon did that even was it live or it was a live right? It was live
0:18:01.840000 - 0:18:06.460000::That's the part that gets you okay, they do TV a little bit, but here's what I'm saying
0:18:07.880000 - 0:18:11.820000::It makes me sad because guess what it's not like our
0:18:12.720000 - 0:18:20.300000::Country was so curious about what's on the moon and let's go study the rocks and see what type it right as our caves and mountains
0:18:20.300000 - 0:18:24.680000::No, we don't give a fuck about that all we cared about was the Cold War and getting ahead of
0:18:25.740000 - 0:18:29.780000::Resovia it's the Russia fuck getting asserting our dominance and
0:18:30.420000 - 0:18:39.500000::That's me is do you ever think about that? That's pathetic. So it makes me think like all these advancements that we have come to know as comforts started off as
0:18:39.500000 - 0:18:41.500000::as
0:18:41.500000 - 0:18:43.500000::Maybe like through petting is
0:18:43.700000 - 0:18:46.640000::Well, this is what they say why they say why they say that
0:18:47.900000 - 0:18:49.900000::competition is
0:18:49.900000 - 0:18:56.740000::Ultimately, this is what they say that competitions ultimately going to stop anything from ever being as good as it could possibly be because at a certain point
0:18:56.860000 - 0:18:59.100000::The most popular or the best businesses
0:18:59.100000 - 0:19:04.100000::Saviast idea is going to have to win there's gonna be a certain upper echelon of
0:19:04.460000 - 0:19:10.180000::Amazing products, but at the end of the day there's gonna be a certain focus that needs to be happening on
0:19:10.740000 - 0:19:16.180000::Winning that's always gonna be there inherently that's gonna take energy away
0:19:16.500000 - 0:19:21.200000::From doing the best job is such a sense as at the project. Does that make sense? Yes
0:19:21.860000 - 0:19:27.500000::Are you sure? I think it does I have to think on that one, but I think I agree with you fully
0:19:27.500000 - 0:19:29.500000::That makes perfect sense
0:19:29.500000 - 0:19:31.500000::You think we didn't go to the moon everybody now
0:19:32.340000 - 0:19:35.420000::I don't know I just don't know I don't know here's the thing
0:19:35.420000 - 0:19:41.700000::I think people need to get more comfortable with saying this these three words. I don't fucking know that
0:19:42.260000 - 0:19:46.820000::But really quick about aliens. Yeah, I did see a crazy as video show today
0:19:47.540000 - 0:19:50.580000::Spaceship was on top leading scientists Tom D'Long
0:19:54.180000 - 0:19:59.540000::People laugh at him, but he did advance a lot of the disclosure that's happened to Congress and so

0:20:00 - 0:20:03.360000::when you laugh you might want to clap instead because you're going to be thinking
0:20:03.360000 - 0:20:05.400000::him in a few years when disclosures really happened.
0:20:05.400000 - 0:20:06.400000::Laughter is clapping with your throat.
0:20:06.400000 - 0:20:09.280000::He posted a video that was shot in Texas of a...
0:20:09.280000 - 0:20:10.680000::It could have been CGI.
0:20:10.680000 - 0:20:11.680000::We don't know.
0:20:11.680000 - 0:20:12.680000::J.A.P. was shot in Texas.
0:20:12.680000 - 0:20:15.280000::A lot of people are shot in Texas.
0:20:15.280000 - 0:20:17.080000::Alamo.
0:20:17.080000 - 0:20:21.720000::But listen, they had a soda spaceship taking off very fast.
0:20:21.720000 - 0:20:22.720000::Okay.
0:20:22.720000 - 0:20:23.720000::A shadow.
0:20:23.720000 - 0:20:25.240000::He doesn't have a moving really fast.
0:20:25.240000 - 0:20:27.760000::Look like the TickTacks, almost a bigger version of the TickTack.
0:20:27.760000 - 0:20:28.760000::We have TickTacks.
0:20:29.240000 - 0:20:30.240000::Guess what?
0:20:30.240000 - 0:20:32.400000::Guess what that ship looked very similar to Nate.
0:20:32.400000 - 0:20:33.400000::What?
0:20:33.400000 - 0:20:34.400000::What's that?
0:20:34.400000 - 0:20:37.040000::The thing from Toy Story with that eyes squeezed out.
0:20:37.040000 - 0:20:38.920000::Mmm, not quite.
0:20:38.920000 - 0:20:42.280000::It looked very similar to...
0:20:42.280000 - 0:20:46.840000::I'm sorry, this non-alcoholic soda I'm drinking is so good, but it's making me...
0:20:46.840000 - 0:20:47.840000::Buzzed a little bit.
0:20:47.840000 - 0:20:49.840000::No, it made my...
0:20:49.840000 - 0:20:51.920000::Let me feel indigestive.
0:20:51.920000 - 0:20:56.320000::But no, it looked very similar to a painting of a...
0:20:56.320000 - 0:21:00.240000::There's a famous painting from the 1500s called the Nuremberg Incident.
0:21:00.240000 - 0:21:04.160000::And it seems to depict over the city of Nuremberg in 1561...
0:21:04.160000 - 0:21:05.160000::Where is that?
0:21:05.160000 - 0:21:07.640000::A spate that's Germany.
0:21:07.640000 - 0:21:11.160000::A spaceship sitting above the city and some chaos and swimming from the spaceship.
0:21:11.160000 - 0:21:12.160000::Oh, my.
0:21:12.160000 - 0:21:19.400000::And by the way, there are reports to chlorobarate the painting from some journal entries.
0:21:19.400000 - 0:21:21::Co-operative, really robberating.
0:21:21 - 0:21:22::So what is it?
0:21:22 - 0:21:26::Very interesting that there's a spaceship from the 1500s that looks very similar to a
0:21:26 - 0:21:30.520000::spaceship that is showing in Texas on video, present day.
0:21:30.520000 - 0:21:36.480000::So you're saying there was a painting of an old-ass time ago and then there was a footage
0:21:36.480000 - 0:21:39.600000::caught recently and the two alien spaceships look most similar.
0:21:39.600000 - 0:21:40.600000::Hold up.
0:21:40.600000 - 0:21:42.040000::I got a little bit of an issue with that.
0:21:42.040000 - 0:21:44.960000::So this is the same making model of spaceship.
0:21:44.960000 - 0:21:45.960000::Like they haven't...
0:21:45.960000 - 0:21:47.280000::They haven't progressed at all.
0:21:47.280000 - 0:21:48.280000::Like they're not...
0:21:48.280000 - 0:21:49.800000::Oh, I think this is my question, too, Nate.
0:21:49.800000 - 0:21:54.200000::Every year us as humans, we're coming out with the 2021 Toyota Prius.
0:21:54.200000 - 0:21:57.120000::We're coming out with the 2022 Toyota Prius SE.
0:21:57.120000 - 0:21:59.640000::That's because we're now in advance with...
0:21:59.640000 - 0:22:00.640000::So they just have...
0:22:00.640000 - 0:22:04.080000::Do you know about the word bespoke, Nate?
0:22:04.080000 - 0:22:06.680000::That means quality and people were brothers.
0:22:06.680000 - 0:22:12.520000::I have bespoke hats and pants and coats and these bespoke items that were handcrafted
0:22:12.520000 - 0:22:14.080000::and made with love and care.
0:22:14.080000 - 0:22:15.280000::They last...
0:22:15.280000 - 0:22:17.960000::They're supposed to last your whole lifetime.
0:22:17.960000 - 0:22:21.160000::Maybe the aliens make bespoke alien ships.
0:22:21.160000 - 0:22:22.160000::You know what I mean?
0:22:22.160000 - 0:22:23.160000::That's this custom made.
0:22:23.160000 - 0:22:24.440000::It kind of say something there.
0:22:24.440000 - 0:22:27.160000::It lasts for a lifetime.
0:22:27.160000 - 0:22:28.160000::We don't know.
0:22:28.160000 - 0:22:29.160000::I'm not kidding you.
0:22:29.160000 - 0:22:34.240000::I cannot remember the last week that I did not learn a word in English.
0:22:34.240000 - 0:22:35.680000::Pretty much every fucking week.
0:22:35.680000 - 0:22:36.680000::I am learning a word in English.
0:22:36.680000 - 0:22:37.680000::That's good.
0:22:37.680000 - 0:22:38.680000::No, it's not awesome because it means I'm catching up.
0:22:38.680000 - 0:22:39.680000::We got to keep you reading and reading.
0:22:39.680000 - 0:22:40.680000::What did I just learn?
0:22:40.680000 - 0:22:41.680000::Be bespoke.
0:22:41.680000 - 0:22:42.680000::Bespoke.
0:22:42.680000 - 0:22:44.680000::And Nate, did you know that?
0:22:44.680000 - 0:22:45.680000::Of course I know that.
0:22:45.680000 - 0:22:46.680000::I knew that.
0:22:46.680000 - 0:22:47.680000::Fuck off your lying.
0:22:47.680000 - 0:22:48.680000::You lying.
0:22:48.680000 - 0:22:49.680000::I did.
0:22:49.680000 - 0:22:50.680000::I am 100% lying.
0:22:50.680000 - 0:22:51.680000::All right.
0:22:51.720000 - 0:22:53.040000::Let me ask if you know this word.
0:22:53.040000 - 0:22:55.800000::Eric, you probably know it too because you're a nerd.
0:22:55.800000 - 0:22:57.960000::The word is parody.
0:22:57.960000 - 0:22:59.440000::And I'm not talking about ha ha ha.
0:22:59.440000 - 0:23:00.760000::P-A-R-I-T-Y.
0:23:00.760000 - 0:23:01.600000::Parity means.
0:23:01.600000 - 0:23:03.600000::What Nate tried.
0:23:03.600000 - 0:23:05.120000::Nate, do you know that?
0:23:05.120000 - 0:23:06.120000::No, no.
0:23:06.120000 - 0:23:07.120000::I know parody.
0:23:07.120000 - 0:23:08.120000::Comedy parody very well.
0:23:08.120000 - 0:23:09.120000::Well, parody is not always bad.
0:23:09.120000 - 0:23:10.120000::Well, it's not always bad.
0:23:10.120000 - 0:23:11.120000::P-A-R-I-T-Y.
0:23:11.120000 - 0:23:12.120000::You don't know that one, Nate.
0:23:12.120000 - 0:23:13.120000::Parity, no.
0:23:13.120000 - 0:23:14.120000::Let's go.
0:23:14.120000 - 0:23:16.120000::I feel like Nate, you and I have a...
0:23:16.120000 - 0:23:18.600000::I feel like most people know what parody means.
0:23:18.600000 - 0:23:19.600000::All right.
0:23:19.600000 - 0:23:20.600000::Right?
0:23:20.600000 - 0:23:21.600000::Glasses.
0:23:21.600000 - 0:23:22.600000::No, I don't.
0:23:22.600000 - 0:23:25.600000::But if you went to liberal arts like me, what does it mean?
0:23:25.600000 - 0:23:26.600000::P-A-R-I-T-Y.
0:23:26.600000 - 0:23:27.600000::I don't remember.
0:23:27.600000 - 0:23:28.600000::I don't remember.
0:23:28.600000 - 0:23:30.440000::We'd need to establish knowledge parody on our team.
0:23:30.440000 - 0:23:32.880000::That would mean that if there's a new member on the team
0:23:32.880000 - 0:23:35.760000::and the rest of the team knows some shit about some subject,
0:23:35.760000 - 0:23:37.080000::boink then.
0:23:41.080000 - 0:23:43.160000::Establishing parody means bringing everybody up
0:23:43.160000 - 0:23:46.560000::to the same level, bringing people to a level of equalism.
0:23:46.560000 - 0:23:47.640000::Same as.
0:23:47.640000 - 0:23:48.640000::Really?
0:23:48.640000 - 0:23:51::So how would you use it if you were just being normal?
0:23:51 - 0:23:52::Yeah.
0:23:52 - 0:23:53::Like, hey, man, what are you going to get for?
0:23:53 - 0:23:54::Like, what's up?
0:23:54 - 0:23:55::You want to give some lunch?
0:23:55 - 0:23:58::I don't think people use it in day-to-day conversation unless it's like, I need to establish
0:23:58 - 0:23:59::pay parody with you.
0:23:59 - 0:24:00::Hmm.
0:24:00 - 0:24:01::Are you learning this stuff?
0:24:01 - 0:24:02::I want to establish pay parody with you.
0:24:02 - 0:24:03::I was in English, May, J.
0:24:03 - 0:24:04::You know that?
0:24:04 - 0:24:05::You were a fucking English major.
0:24:05 - 0:24:06::Yeah.
0:24:06 - 0:24:07::Dang, man.
0:24:07 - 0:24:08::Yeah.
0:24:08 - 0:24:10.800000::What was your favorite book in college, Nate?
0:24:10.800000 - 0:24:15.720000::I would do like the spark notes for every single class that I was in.
0:24:15.720000 - 0:24:16.960000::Like didn't pay attention.
0:24:16.960000 - 0:24:22.520000::It took like probably, you know, 15% of the classes that I had to go to just showed up
0:24:22.520000 - 0:24:25.160000::for the exams pretty much like 15%.
0:24:25.160000 - 0:24:28.800000::Just scooted my way through college.
0:24:28.800000 - 0:24:29.800000::And I got pretty great too.
0:24:29.800000 - 0:24:30.800000::No way.
0:24:30.800000 - 0:24:35.800000::I'm ashamed to say, Nate, as I was the exact same fucking way.
0:24:35.800000 - 0:24:38.200000::But here's the thing.
0:24:38.200000 - 0:24:40.920000::Are we smart for doing that?
0:24:40.920000 - 0:24:42.400000::Or were we idiots?
0:24:42.400000 - 0:24:44.480000::Well, look at people like Steve Jobs.
0:24:44.480000 - 0:24:46.280000::Look at people like Elon Musk.
0:24:46.280000 - 0:24:50.320000::The smartest people tend to not be the hardest workers because what you're doing is you
0:24:50.320000 - 0:24:54.120000::are reclaiming your labor, you're reclaiming your relationship with people who are trying
0:24:54.120000 - 0:24:58.140000::to control your time, control your mind and control the way that you are feeling that
0:24:58.140000 - 0:24:59::day in a sense.

0:25:00 - 0:25:03.060000::You guys know that Elon Musk tweeted about a month ago that he liked step brothers and
0:25:03.060000 - 0:25:05::that he was rewatching it.
0:25:05 - 0:25:06::That's awesome.
0:25:06 - 0:25:08::Sometimes you gotta give the man credit.
0:25:08 - 0:25:09.640000::We're stuck to do.
0:25:09.640000 - 0:25:12.400000::Let me say something that this is basically like a rare thing.
0:25:12.400000 - 0:25:13.800000::I don't even know how to describe this.
0:25:13.800000 - 0:25:15.680000::It's a new type of rare thing.
0:25:15.680000 - 0:25:17.440000::Do you guys know what the step brothers commentary is?
0:25:17.440000 - 0:25:18.440000::DVD commentary?
0:25:18.440000 - 0:25:19.440000::No.
0:25:19.440000 - 0:25:20.440000::No.
0:25:20.440000 - 0:25:21.440000::Wait, wait, wait, wait.
0:25:21.440000 - 0:25:22.440000::I think I do.
0:25:22.440000 - 0:25:26.940000::It is a musical improv commentary where they're singing about the production of the film with
0:25:26.940000 - 0:25:31.240000::like Will Ferrell, whatever's named Adam McCay and John C. Riley.
0:25:31.240000 - 0:25:35.880000::And they're making up songs about how they feel like they look so fat and ugly in the scenes.
0:25:35.880000 - 0:25:39.420000::And they're singing songs about how much the prosthetic nuts cost.
0:25:39.420000 - 0:25:43.260000::And then Gilbert Arena shows up on the one point in the phone.
0:25:43.260000 - 0:25:44.660000::I think that's a basketball player.
0:25:44.660000 - 0:25:48.500000::And the only reason I know him is from the step brothers commentary.
0:25:48.500000 - 0:25:52.860000::But that's a rare type of thing now because it's like, how can you even get that?
0:25:52.860000 - 0:25:54.420000::You need to find the DVD.
0:25:54.420000 - 0:25:57.620000::Then you need to rip it under the off of the DVD.
0:25:57.620000 - 0:25:58.620000::And that's it.
0:25:58.620000 - 0:25:59.620000::But I guess that's how.
0:25:59.620000 - 0:26:01.100000::Well, Nate, you were saying this.
0:26:01.100000 - 0:26:04.860000::You were shouting this from the rooftops when you got all fucked up in New York, but you
0:26:04.860000 - 0:26:07.340000::were saying physical media is coming back.
0:26:07.340000 - 0:26:10.140000::Streamy is dying and physical media is coming back.
0:26:10.140000 - 0:26:11.140000::Well, right.
0:26:11.140000 - 0:26:13.340000::Podcasts are going to come out on cassettes.
0:26:13.340000 - 0:26:14.340000::Yeah.
0:26:14.340000 - 0:26:15.340000::Watch your back.
0:26:15.340000 - 0:26:16.340000::Yeah.
0:26:16.340000 - 0:26:20.180000::I mean, a lot of people you are listening to things on Spotify, your YouTube, everything
0:26:20.180000 - 0:26:21.780000::is in the cloud.
0:26:21.780000 - 0:26:23.940000::Everything is online right now.
0:26:23.940000 - 0:26:31.060000::And I have this weird feeling that we want to get back to physical type of media.
0:26:31.060000 - 0:26:32.780000::And I think people are desperate for it.
0:26:32.780000 - 0:26:34.260000::And they want it badly.
0:26:34.260000 - 0:26:36.220000::And you know why?
0:26:36.220000 - 0:26:37.220000::Why is that?
0:26:37.220000 - 0:26:38.220000::Why?
0:26:38.220000 - 0:26:44.660000::Because we have more senses than just sight and sound hearing.
0:26:44.660000 - 0:26:50.700000::And when you get a VHS, when you get a CD, you smell the CD, you smell the VHS, you feel
0:26:50.700000 - 0:26:51.780000::the touch.
0:26:51.780000 - 0:26:55.180000::And those things really sent memory touch flavor.
0:26:55.180000 - 0:26:57.420000::Those things all really stick with you.
0:26:57.420000 - 0:26:58.420000::You can suck on it.
0:26:58.420000 - 0:27:02.380000::Nate, you like to suck on just like every thing you ever put in your mouth.
0:27:02.380000 - 0:27:03.380000::You know, it sucks.
0:27:03.380000 - 0:27:04.380000::It sucks.
0:27:04.380000 - 0:27:05.380000::It sucks.
0:27:05.380000 - 0:27:06.380000::It sucks.
0:27:06.380000 - 0:27:07.380000::It sucks.
0:27:07.380000 - 0:27:08.380000::It sucks.
0:27:08.380000 - 0:27:09.380000::That's dangerous.
0:27:09.380000 - 0:27:10.380000::That's dangerous.
0:27:10.380000 - 0:27:14.020000::Remember them on the Patreon we did, we went through TNZ's, remember them.
0:27:14.020000 - 0:27:15.020000::Article.
0:27:15.020000 - 0:27:16.020000::They said, remember DVDs.
0:27:16.020000 - 0:27:21.460000::But remember, no, remember this, this is a new segment.
0:27:21.460000 - 0:27:22.460000::What?
0:27:22.460000 - 0:27:25.220000::We were here, man, because we're kind of, we're really hot in here.
0:27:25.220000 - 0:27:26.220000::It's hot in here.
0:27:26.220000 - 0:27:31.860000::I can't remember the Disney VHS is all puffed out.
0:27:31.860000 - 0:27:32.860000::No.
0:27:32.860000 - 0:27:33.860000::You don't remember that?
0:27:33.860000 - 0:27:34.860000::What do you mean like a puffier VHS?
0:27:34.860000 - 0:27:35.860000::How did it fit in the cloth?
0:27:35.860000 - 0:27:36.860000::It was like the cloth.
0:27:36.860000 - 0:27:39.100000::No, no, the VHS itself was normal.
0:27:39.100000 - 0:27:40.700000::But the case was like a puffy like.
0:27:40.700000 - 0:27:44.180000::Like a bumpy plastic squishy and like air.
0:27:44.180000 - 0:27:45.180000::It was like this.
0:27:45.180000 - 0:27:46.180000::It was just a regular sleeve.
0:27:46.180000 - 0:27:47.180000::Yes, thick.
0:27:47.180000 - 0:27:48.180000::It was thick.
0:27:48.180000 - 0:27:49.180000::It was a small though.
0:27:49.180000 - 0:27:54.620000::It got those small though in DVD VHS tapes sent to him from his long lost relatives and
0:27:54.620000 - 0:27:55.620000::whatnot.
0:27:55.620000 - 0:27:56.620000::No, I didn't.
0:27:56.620000 - 0:27:57.620000::But I'll tell you something pathetic.
0:27:57.620000 - 0:28:02.540000::When I was a kid I got shipped the Disney Land VHS that showed you how awesome Disney Land
0:28:02.540000 - 0:28:03.540000::was.
0:28:03.540000 - 0:28:04.540000::No.
0:28:04.540000 - 0:28:05.540000::Did you ever get that?
0:28:05.540000 - 0:28:06.540000::No.
0:28:06.540000 - 0:28:07.540000::I wish I could.
0:28:07.540000 - 0:28:08.540000::They would send this to children.
0:28:08.540000 - 0:28:10.420000::I think I've signed up for it on the internet.
0:28:10.420000 - 0:28:11.740000::For Disney Children's Mail.
0:28:11.740000 - 0:28:16.300000::But they sent out the VHS that just makes Disney Land look like the sickest place on
0:28:16.300000 - 0:28:17.300000::the planet.
0:28:17.300000 - 0:28:19.820000::It does remember begging to go.
0:28:19.820000 - 0:28:21.460000::And yet we weren't.
0:28:21.460000 - 0:28:23.740000::Disney World is the scariest place on the planet.
0:28:23.740000 - 0:28:24.740000::Don't go.
0:28:24.740000 - 0:28:28.660000::If you're listening and you're on your way to Orlando Studios, go into the cockpit and
0:28:28.660000 - 0:28:30.260000::don't do anything bad.
0:28:30.260000 - 0:28:34.540000::But just tell them you don't want anyone going to Disney World.
0:28:34.540000 - 0:28:38.380000::Because the people in those, let's just say I know a lot of people who work inside of
0:28:38.380000 - 0:28:41.940000::those mascots costumes that you think are so nice and friendly.
0:28:41.940000 - 0:28:46.740000::But the people who are inside of those mascots costumes, they're not so friendly.
0:28:46.740000 - 0:28:49.660000::And if you go up there, I think they look their lives.
0:28:49.660000 - 0:28:52.340000::You don't know that because I talked to them on the discord.
0:28:52.340000 - 0:28:55.540000::I am in the mascots only discord I've hacked in.
0:28:55.540000 - 0:28:58.260000::And I literally because I used to be a mall Santa.
0:28:58.260000 - 0:29:03.380000::And what happened is I am listening to a violent uprise.
0:29:03.380000 - 0:29:04.380000::The people.
0:29:04.380000 - 0:29:07.860000::Let's just say the person who plays goofy is going to explode.
0:29:07.860000 - 0:29:11.900000::And three days and you need to not be around him when it happens.
0:29:11.900000 - 0:29:14.020000::I don't know where you're getting this information, Jack.
0:29:14.020000 - 0:29:18.660000::Because Nate, did you know people who went to Disney college?
0:29:18.660000 - 0:29:19.660000::Disney college.
0:29:19.660000 - 0:29:20.660000::What is that?
0:29:20.660000 - 0:29:21.660000::Disney college.
0:29:21.660000 - 0:29:29.300000::I'm sorry if this term is a sensitive term, but this is basically to me indentured servitude
0:29:29.300000 - 0:29:34.420000::where people sign up to go to Disney college.
0:29:34.420000 - 0:29:37.060000::And basically they stay in some expensive dorms.
0:29:37.060000 - 0:29:39.860000::They have to pay to be I feel like they have to pay to be there.
0:29:39.860000 - 0:29:42.300000::And they learn how to do all the different jobs at Disney.
0:29:42.300000 - 0:29:44.860000::And then afterwards they might get a job as like a cashier.
0:29:44.860000 - 0:29:46.380000::Wow, man, that sounds like the play.
0:29:46.380000 - 0:29:47.380000::It might get a job.
0:29:47.380000 - 0:29:48.380000::It's not guarantee.
0:29:48.380000 - 0:29:49.380000::It's not guarantee.
0:29:49.380000 - 0:29:50.380000::What?
0:29:50.380000 - 0:29:51.380000::It's not guarantee.
0:29:51.380000 - 0:29:52.380000::It's guarantee.
0:29:52.380000 - 0:29:59.100000::And you know my estranged aunt by marriage works, still as a cashier at Disneyland.
0:29:59.100000 - 0:29:59.940000::She is a cashier.

0:30:00 - 0:30:05.760000::Yeah, where at some gift store? I don't want to dox but but pray for her business because I know
0:30:06.080000 - 0:30:08.040000::Yeah, well, COVID didn't really rock Disney World
0:30:08.040000 - 0:30:10.640000::No, no people are risking life and limb to get there
0:30:11.400000 - 0:30:14.040000::You too Nate was at the front door of salivating
0:30:14.720000 - 0:30:20::Pound and at the fucking gates look for some big guy. No, Nate is a California adventure fucking freak
0:30:20.360000 - 0:30:23.200000::You've been to California adventure. How many times? Yeah, you like the nice
0:30:23.200000 - 0:30:29.960000::I can't even count you freak. I can't even count at this point. I stay there. I think a record just got set of a guy
0:30:30 - 0:30:35.200000::That was that Disney land like 400 and something days in a row. That's it 600
0:30:35.760000 - 0:30:37.760000::I don't know a lot of days. All right
0:30:38.320000 - 0:30:43.200000::That's awesome and I kind of love that the world is kind of whysening up to people that love
0:30:43.520000 - 0:30:49.480000::Because I feel like I'm 20 years ago. It was like a fringe opinion to think that people like who like Disney
0:30:49.680000 - 0:30:54.320000::We're kind of like cringe and cringe didn't even exist back then
0:30:54.320000 - 0:30:59.880000::Which I think a lot of people might even want to go back to those times where there was no such thing as cringe
0:31:00.320000 - 0:31:05.680000::Cringe is ending. Yeah, we are in a post cringe reality right now. Okay, but well
0:31:05.680000 - 0:31:11.680000::What yeah, well you come to realize is that the people that you call cringe are the people that are just not in your bubble
0:31:12.640000 - 0:31:16.640000::And what right what the beauty that the cringe movement has brought us is that we've realized
0:31:17.520000 - 0:31:22::Do you know what a bubble looks like? Well, you know what a bubble looks like from out the outside?
0:31:23.120000 - 0:31:28.080000::Yeah, looks like a distorted reflection of the rest of existence. Oh my goodness
0:31:28.160000 - 0:31:33.840000::You hit me to take tags really quick as you need to freshen up your breath because that sense damn Eric your breath fucking stings
0:31:35.520000 - 0:31:38.480000::My breath has never stopped my the dentist was like damn
0:31:39.760000 - 0:31:46.480000::Tap in now to the patreon. We're doing crazy as shit there. We're doing things that are not legal to do love the patreon
0:31:47.440000 - 0:31:48.960000::literally the
0:31:48.960000 - 0:31:54.880000::The community we're building is so large. It's like what is this a country? It's so big. What is this it inflating?
0:31:55.680000 - 0:32:00.560000::One of those things you put water on and it starts inflating in the tub one of those dinosaurs. Oh those are
0:32:00.960000 - 0:32:02.880000::Those are great. I think it happens if you eat one of those
0:32:03.120000 - 0:32:05.520000::Those are fun. It's stomach acid and then blows the fuck up
0:32:06 - 0:32:09.920000::Remember did you ever hear that if you eat a watermelon seed? Of course, it's game over
0:32:10.800000 - 0:32:13.600000::What if you snore a watermelon seed is your brain start going to watermelon?
0:32:14.720000 - 0:32:16.240000::And you work
0:32:16.240000 - 0:32:19.520000::All right, what's the next topic we got here man? Not that we know okay
0:32:19.600000 - 0:32:24.560000::So we need one we could go for you free stuff. This is a juicy. This is really juicy right here because
0:32:25.440000 - 0:32:26.480000::um
0:32:26.480000 - 0:32:29.600000::So I want to hit you guys with this fact right now that might shock you
0:32:30.560000 - 0:32:32.560000::75% of people
0:32:33.440000 - 0:32:36::believe that sentient AI
0:32:36.880000 - 0:32:44.160000::Deserve to be treated with respect. Let me say that again real quick just so you can look because you're probably thinking what the fuck
0:32:44.880000 - 0:32:49.120000::75% of people live that yes 75% of people believe that sentient AI
0:32:49.600000 - 0:32:52.320000::Deserve to be treated with respect
0:32:53.120000 - 0:32:57.760000::So i'm imagining you to have some kind of opinion on this subject
0:32:58.080000 - 0:33:02.720000::We've talked about AI before how can you not right now? I feel like it's kind of the hot button topic
0:33:03.200000 - 0:33:06.720000::We definitely have opinions but Nate I want to know what you think about this because
0:33:07.360000 - 0:33:10.800000::You were telling me well Nate was fucked up most of the time as in New York
0:33:10.800000 - 0:33:14.240000::But one night I think all the whole entire time from yeah
0:33:14.800000 - 0:33:17.760000::You were all fucked up dark brown liquor on your breath
0:33:18.080000 - 0:33:21.840000::You kind of snuck in my bedroom and whispered to me get up get up. I gotta tell you something
0:33:22.480000 - 0:33:29.600000::And you basically wearing a drunken stupor and tell me all about how much you can't wait for AI robots to come alive so you can beat the shit out of them
0:33:30.400000 - 0:33:31.840000::But
0:33:31.840000 - 0:33:35.280000::This is because you've always wanted to beat someone but you don't want to be a violent to human being
0:33:35.600000 - 0:33:39.440000::I want to I want there to be an AI sort of revolution
0:33:39.600000 - 0:33:43.680000::Okay, but here's where I differ with the with 75% of people. I want there to be
0:33:43.760000 - 0:33:47.360000::I want most of the things I see in the world to be sentient AI
0:33:47.760000 - 0:33:49.760000::type of humanoid objects
0:33:50 - 0:33:54.160000::But here's where I differ. I think don't think they deserve to be treated with respect
0:33:54.320000 - 0:33:58.400000::In fact, I believe the opposite of that and I want to be going in the grocery store
0:33:58.480000 - 0:34:04.400000::Just fucking body ain't taking a fucking pump face palm in an AI humanoid by the fucking head and
0:34:06.640000 - 0:34:12.160000::Fucking fucking his head up right on the fucking countertop fucking their ass up
0:34:12.160000 - 0:34:16.800000::Just everywhere I go. I'm just shoving these into fucking traffic. They're getting fucking exploded
0:34:17.840000 - 0:34:22.800000::I'd pay like kind of a month between so where it's cool and I can do that and you're on the platinum plan
0:34:23.120000 - 0:34:27.360000::I'm on the platinum. Yeah, I'm a serial murder mass mass
0:34:28.800000 - 0:34:31.600000::All right, let's let's role play. I'm a I'm a
0:34:33.200000 - 0:34:36.480000::Whatever humanoid, but not too humanoid. It's pretty robotic
0:34:36.880000 - 0:34:40.160000::So it's not too traumatizing for children or anybody and I'm okay
0:34:40.160000 - 0:34:41.920000::And I'm just somebody working at the grocery store
0:34:41.920000 - 0:34:43.120000::It's not
0:34:43.200000 - 0:34:48.400000::You know, it's it's just that sounds kind of like a wrote it sounds like bender from feature. I'm okay
0:34:48.400000 - 0:34:50.400000::I won't do the voice
0:34:50.400000 - 0:34:53.760000::But Jack is a jack is a cashier. You're a humanoid. Yeah

0:35:00 - 0:35:02.100000::I'll write just check out the groceries.
0:35:02.100000 - 0:35:03.560000::I guess you may not need that, but.
0:35:03.560000 - 0:35:05::Well, no, we'll fit it in.
0:35:05 - 0:35:07.080000::And I come over to you.
0:35:07.080000 - 0:35:11.480000::You would ask for a half and a half for your coffee.
0:35:11.480000 - 0:35:13::And I brought you a skim,
0:35:13 - 0:35:15.120000::fucking nasty ass watery milk.
0:35:15.120000 - 0:35:18.160000::Whoopsie, they make mistakes too.

0:35:19 - 0:35:20.120000::I'm sorry about that.
0:35:21.120000 - 0:35:22.560000::They only had skim milk.
0:35:23.720000 - 0:35:24.600000::I'm bringing tea on a tray.
0:35:24.600000 - 0:35:26.840000::You're with your daughters, three daughters.
0:35:26.840000 - 0:35:28.360000::Oh, damn, I was my family.

0:35:29.360000 - 0:35:31.280000::No wife, though, man.
0:35:31.280000 - 0:35:32.600000::I don't want them to see this.
0:35:32.600000 - 0:35:35.160000::I would say, I would say, hey, sweet hearts,

0:35:43.280000 - 0:35:44.880000::Are you gonna fucking do this?
0:35:44.880000 - 0:35:46.200000::The shit that you do to the AI?
0:35:46.200000 - 0:35:48.800000::And I'm like, just get out of the restaurant right now.
0:35:48.800000 - 0:35:49.720000::You don't want to see this.
0:35:49.720000 - 0:35:50.560000::What I'm doing.
0:35:50.560000 - 0:35:51.720000::And then I'm looking at you like this.
0:35:51.720000 - 0:35:53.680000::Was everything to your satisfaction, sir?
0:35:53.680000 - 0:35:55::And I said shut the fuck up.

0:36:02.680000 - 0:36:03.960000::You can tell I'm a little scared
0:36:03.960000 - 0:36:04.800000::because I feel fear.
0:36:04.800000 - 0:36:06.600000::So sorry, sorry about that.

0:37:20.440000 - 0:37:22.120000::The hardest you could smile saying.
0:37:22.120000 - 0:37:23.120000::You got his child here.
0:37:23.120000 - 0:37:25.520000::He shows all gold molars.
0:37:25.520000 - 0:37:27.160000::And I said, get out.
0:37:27.160000 - 0:37:28.960000::Fucking restaurant right now to my fucking daughters.
0:37:28.960000 - 0:37:31.600000::Get out of the fucking goddamn restaurant.
0:37:31.600000 - 0:37:34.480000::Right now, I, dad is gonna take care of some shit.
0:37:34.480000 - 0:37:36.600000::They, they know that I'm not playing around right now.
0:37:36.600000 - 0:37:38.120000::They fucking screwed out of it.
0:37:38.120000 - 0:37:40.200000::And I go up to the child and I say,
0:37:40.200000 - 0:37:43::is that your, hello there, little, little guy?
0:37:43 - 0:37:44.800000::Please, he's, he's, he's praying new.
0:37:44.800000 - 0:37:45.800000::No, please shut up.
0:37:45.800000 - 0:37:46.800000::Shut your fuck out.
0:37:46.800000 - 0:37:47.800000::Yeah, yeah, yeah.
0:37:47.800000 - 0:37:49.480000::That is my dad.
0:37:49.480000 - 0:37:50.840000::He gave birth to me.
0:37:50.840000 - 0:37:52.880000::I really, you up by the head.
0:37:52.880000 - 0:37:53.720000::Oh.
0:37:53.720000 - 0:37:55.600000::And I take you up to my level kind of.
0:37:55.600000 - 0:37:56.440000::Sir.
0:37:56.440000 - 0:37:57.280000::I love you.
0:37:57.280000 - 0:37:58.120000::Sir, that hurts.
0:37:58.120000 - 0:38:00.600000::And I take you and I fucking wind up.
0:38:00.600000 - 0:38:03.320000::Fucking Pedro Martinez picture style.
0:38:03.320000 - 0:38:08.800000::Throw your ass as hard as I fucking can into the glass window.
0:38:08.800000 - 0:38:11.640000::You, we're also on the fucking top floor
0:38:11.640000 - 0:38:14.040000::at the Hancock and the Chicago Hancock.
0:38:14.040000 - 0:38:14.880000::Oh, gee.
0:38:14.880000 - 0:38:16.600000::You getting groceries at the top?
0:38:16.600000 - 0:38:18.680000::This is a grocery store at the top floor of the,
0:38:18.680000 - 0:38:20.560000::oh, I've given him coffee.
0:38:20.560000 - 0:38:21.880000::Oh, is that the restaurant?
0:38:21.880000 - 0:38:23.760000::Well, it's a grocery kind of coffee daily.
0:38:23.760000 - 0:38:24.600000::I'm not mad.
0:38:24.600000 - 0:38:25.440000::Let's have the top floor.
0:38:25.440000 - 0:38:26.280000::It's like 96 floor.
0:38:26.280000 - 0:38:27.280000::This is a whole lot of things.
0:38:27.280000 - 0:38:28.120000::Yeah, yeah.
0:38:28.120000 - 0:38:29.280000::I'm not mad at my badminton future.
0:38:29.280000 - 0:38:30.920000::And they do have grocery stores I have in the Hancock.
0:38:30.920000 - 0:38:31.760000::Okay.
0:38:31.760000 - 0:38:34.080000::And as soon as I throw this fucking your child out,
0:38:34.080000 - 0:38:36.680000::I just am looking at Eric the entire time
0:38:36.680000 - 0:38:38.240000::of the humanoid.
0:38:38.240000 - 0:38:40.240000::And I'm just looking at, and what are you doing?
0:38:40.240000 - 0:38:41.080000::What?
0:38:41.080000 - 0:38:42.080000::And then what happens?
0:38:42.080000 - 0:38:46.480000::Eric cries a single tear and I stop.
0:38:46.480000 - 0:38:49.800000::And I'm like, what the, these, they have emotions.
0:38:49.800000 - 0:38:51.960000::I've never seen this new model where they can cry
0:38:51.960000 - 0:38:54.920000::and they have, right, consciousness.
0:38:54.920000 - 0:38:57.200000::And then what do you throw yourself off the build?
0:38:57.200000 - 0:38:59.520000::What do you, yeah.
0:38:59.520000 - 0:39:01.240000::And then I jump out.
0:39:01.240000 - 0:39:02.240000::Oh shit.
0:39:03.240000 - 0:39:04.440000::Oh shit, okay, but then,
0:39:04.440000 - 0:39:06::that's kind of clean neat.
0:39:06 - 0:39:07.280000::It's just a nice story.
0:39:07.280000 - 0:39:09.040000::Your dad, your daughters, whatever.
0:39:09.040000 - 0:39:10.640000::They have to raise themselves because their mom's gone.
0:39:10.640000 - 0:39:11.480000::Yeah, yeah.
0:39:11.480000 - 0:39:12.320000::Well, there's an alternate.
0:39:12.320000 - 0:39:13.840000::There's a part of this ending because you think
0:39:13.840000 - 0:39:15.440000::that's the end of the movie, right?
0:39:15.440000 - 0:39:16.280000::Right.
0:39:16.280000 - 0:39:17.960000::But then all of a sudden you see the three daughters
0:39:17.960000 - 0:39:19.720000::and they're standing at the edge of the window
0:39:19.720000 - 0:39:20.800000::and they're crying.
0:39:20.800000 - 0:39:23.600000::Daddy, daddy, no, he's gone all the way down to the bottom
0:39:23.600000 - 0:39:24.840000::and smack it.
0:39:24.840000 - 0:39:27::And then they kind of turn around and who's behind them
0:39:27 - 0:39:28.480000::getting up, uh.
0:39:28.480000 - 0:39:29.800000::Ah.
0:39:29.800000 - 0:39:30.680000::A child.
0:39:30.680000 - 0:39:32.440000::The child.
0:39:32.440000 - 0:39:38.120000::And now the four of them have to kind of either raise each other
0:39:38.120000 - 0:39:41.080000::or fight each other to the death or, you know,
0:39:41.080000 - 0:39:42.960000::now it's kind of a kid movie.
0:39:42.960000 - 0:39:44.080000::God.
0:39:44.080000 - 0:39:47.760000::So why aren't we that, we are so, I'm like,
0:39:47.760000 - 0:39:49.240000::I'm like, hey, this would be fun.
0:39:49.240000 - 0:39:51.320000::Let's make up a little scenario, be a little funny
0:39:51.320000 - 0:39:52.600000::and have some fun with it.
0:39:52.600000 - 0:39:55::We write a fucking movie in two minutes.
0:39:55 - 0:39:57.160000::And I'm like, it's better than anything that
0:39:57.160000 - 0:39:59.680000::like how Marvel star wars.
0:39:59.680000 - 0:40:00.680000::And by.

0:40:00 - 0:40:02.840000::By the way speaking, the movie's that fucking suck that are coming out.
0:40:02.840000 - 0:40:05.840000::Yo, Star Wars, chill right now.
0:40:05.840000 - 0:40:07.680000::You've done enough damage.
0:40:07.680000 - 0:40:11.360000::You need to let this shit sit for another 10 years and then maybe you can make some one
0:40:11.360000 - 0:40:12.360000::more.
0:40:12.360000 - 0:40:13.360000::You were saying that right, Nate?
0:40:13.360000 - 0:40:14.360000::Well, okay.
0:40:14.360000 - 0:40:19.660000::So what we have here is there's a director called Tyco Atiti and he has directed Thor
0:40:19.660000 - 0:40:20.660000::movies.
0:40:20.660000 - 0:40:22.260000::He was in Jojo Rabbit.
0:40:22.260000 - 0:40:24.960000::He made what we do in the shadow.
0:40:24.960000 - 0:40:26.920000::What we do in the shadows.
0:40:26.920000 - 0:40:29.800000::He is using, he's in New Zealand, and he's
0:40:29.800000 - 0:40:34.320000::using his fucking power as leverage, which a lot of people do in Hollywood.
0:40:34.320000 - 0:40:36.720000::They like this little term leverage.
0:40:36.720000 - 0:40:44.120000::He's using that to star and direct, I think and direct in his own Star Wars movie.
0:40:44.120000 - 0:40:45.120000::Right.
0:40:45.120000 - 0:40:48.720000::We're saying enough Tyco Atiti, enough.
0:40:48.720000 - 0:40:50.600000::And I don't know if we're not calling them out.
0:40:50.600000 - 0:40:56.400000::We're not doing anything of the sort because we do the same thing in his position.
0:40:56.400000 - 0:40:57.720000::But I'm saying, right.
0:40:57.720000 - 0:41:06.120000::Why don't we give the Star Wars franchise to a fucking someone?
0:41:06.120000 - 0:41:10.400000::On action you haven't seen it in a long ass time that can reinvigorate it.
0:41:10.400000 - 0:41:11.400000::Give it to fucking.
0:41:11.400000 - 0:41:13.840000::Who's that guy from R&S with the piercing in his time?
0:41:13.840000 - 0:41:14.920000::I'll tell you who.
0:41:14.920000 - 0:41:15.920000::Who?
0:41:15.920000 - 0:41:18.160000::We need to give it back.
0:41:18.160000 - 0:41:21.880000::Disney needs to give it back to Mr. George Lucas.
0:41:21.880000 - 0:41:22.880000::And guess what?
0:41:22.880000 - 0:41:23.880000::George Lucas.
0:41:23.880000 - 0:41:24.880000::He's back to the guy.
0:41:24.880000 - 0:41:25.880000::George.
0:41:25.880000 - 0:41:26.880000::He lived forever.
0:41:26.880000 - 0:41:29.440000::He's too star in the movie as George Lucas.
0:41:29.440000 - 0:41:30.440000::He needs to get into acting.
0:41:30.440000 - 0:41:31.440000::Oh my god.
0:41:31.440000 - 0:41:33.200000::You see his kind of old as George Lucas.
0:41:33.200000 - 0:41:34.200000::Yeah.
0:41:34.200000 - 0:41:36.200000::George Lucas is basically god.
0:41:36.200000 - 0:41:37.200000::He needs to think about it.
0:41:37.200000 - 0:41:40.080000::Well, oh, imagine because he's already six foot, I think.
0:41:40.080000 - 0:41:43.280000::And then Princess Lay is going, going, oh my god, who are you?
0:41:43.280000 - 0:41:44.520000::My name is George Lucas.
0:41:44.520000 - 0:41:45.520000::Where are you from?
0:41:45.520000 - 0:41:46.520000::I don't know.
0:41:46.520000 - 0:41:47.520000::San Francisco or something.
0:41:47.520000 - 0:41:48.520000::Oh, what did that mean?
0:41:48.520000 - 0:41:50.520000::And he goes, I created you.
0:41:50.520000 - 0:41:52.160000::Oh, what do you mean?
0:41:52.160000 - 0:41:53.160000::What?
0:41:53.160000 - 0:41:55.200000::This is like Charlie Fisher and Pesta.
0:41:55.200000 - 0:41:56.560000::Well, she's well.
0:41:56.560000 - 0:42:00.760000::This is beyond Charles Kaufman because this is like, first of all, this has to be like
0:42:00.760000 - 0:42:02.520000::Casper people who.
0:42:02.520000 - 0:42:04.320000::Being John Malcolm bitch ish.
0:42:04.320000 - 0:42:05.320000::Ish.
0:42:05.320000 - 0:42:06.320000::Yeah, that's sick.
0:42:06.320000 - 0:42:07.320000::And George is walking around.
0:42:07.320000 - 0:42:09.080000::And he has like unlimited powers in this world.
0:42:09.080000 - 0:42:13.400000::He has like Thanos type, but like next level like, I don't think.
0:42:13.400000 - 0:42:15.800000::And he takes out his fucking typewriter.
0:42:15.800000 - 0:42:19.200000::Oh, that what Jabba walkie's coming at right at me.
0:42:19.200000 - 0:42:20.280000::Type up the scene.
0:42:20.280000 - 0:42:22.520000::Then the wookie explodes into million flames.
0:42:22.520000 - 0:42:23.360000::Boink.
0:42:23.360000 - 0:42:25.080000::Somebody else comes out of him with a lightsaber.
0:42:25.080000 - 0:42:27.080000::Lightsabers actually don't work on me.
0:42:27.080000 - 0:42:34.440000::So you're saying, you're saying, a lot of the people in Star Wars, their weapon is,
0:42:34.440000 - 0:42:47.640000::the evilness is large for it is the lightsabers, but George Lucas's weapon is his imagination.
0:42:47.640000 - 0:42:48.640000::That's right.
0:42:48.640000 - 0:42:49.640000::That is pretty much what I'm saying.
0:42:49.640000 - 0:42:50.640000::But yeah.
0:42:50.640000 - 0:42:52.400000::But he has to be able to type fast enough.
0:42:52.400000 - 0:42:56.520000::So the whole first act of the movie, or maybe the second act of the movie is him taking
0:42:56.520000 - 0:42:59.960000::typing classes to try and get up to like 160 words per minute.
0:42:59.960000 - 0:43:01.880000::So that I've already been there by the way.
0:43:01.880000 - 0:43:03.720000::Well, maybe you should be a consultant on the film.
0:43:03.720000 - 0:43:06.680000::Well, I would love to, but no one seems to want to get me a shot in the fucking
0:43:06.680000 - 0:43:07.680000::movie.
0:43:07.680000 - 0:43:11.840000::How does everybody fucking hate this shit out of Eric?
0:43:11.840000 - 0:43:12.840000::Yeah, man.
0:43:12.840000 - 0:43:13.840000::I don't know.
0:43:13.840000 - 0:43:14.840000::I will give you this poison.
0:43:14.840000 - 0:43:20.080000::It is like, I'm like pitching shit for every franchise, for every character, from all
0:43:20.080000 - 0:43:23.080000::the universes I have spin-offs of all this shit.
0:43:23.080000 - 0:43:28.040000::And yet people are fucking telling me to stop calling, put the phone down, stop texting.
0:43:28.040000 - 0:43:31.880000::I'm like, you want, and I know there as, because I say you can use this for free.
0:43:31.880000 - 0:43:32.880000::You can use any idea.
0:43:32.880000 - 0:43:33.880000::Imagine that.
0:43:33.880000 - 0:43:34.880000::I sent you for free.
0:43:34.880000 - 0:43:35.880000::No problem.
0:43:35.880000 - 0:43:39.040000::The cost of a film is so fucking crazy these days and the idea is over a million dollars
0:43:39.040000 - 0:43:40.040000::to make these movies.
0:43:40.040000 - 0:43:41.040000::You'll get a dime.
0:43:41.040000 - 0:43:42.040000::You're gonna die soon.
0:43:42.040000 - 0:43:47.880000::The next person that says, the next person that says this, a filmmaker that says, and
0:43:47.880000 - 0:43:55::I saw a fucking, Spielberg said this recently, this is a pet people mine on a panel.
0:43:55 - 0:43:56::We love panels.
0:43:56 - 0:43:57::We love panels.
0:43:57 - 0:43:58::We love the fucking panel.
0:43:58 - 0:43:59::We love the fucking panel.
0:43:59 - 0:44:04.400000::And I love when creatives get into a panel type scenario and they're kind of taking questions
0:44:04.400000 - 0:44:10.520000::from regular-ass people and they're letting us in on their process and we love that.
0:44:10.520000 - 0:44:11.520000::I love that.
0:44:11.520000 - 0:44:16.560000::This is about a pro-panel podcast and we've been that from the beginning.
0:44:16.560000 - 0:44:21::What I will say is that filmmakers do this weird thing where they will be in the panel
0:44:21 - 0:44:27.400000::scenario at the director's guild association awards or whatever.
0:44:27.400000 - 0:44:32.400000::They're in a panel and they say, these filmmakers today, they have it so easy, you can shoot
0:44:32.400000 - 0:44:34.400000::a fucking movie on your phone.
0:44:34.400000 - 0:44:36.720000::A-da-da references Tangerine.
0:44:36.720000 - 0:44:37.720000::Shut the fuck up.
0:44:37.720000 - 0:44:41.800000::The next filmmaker that says you can make a movie on your phone.
0:44:41.800000 - 0:44:44.400000::You are fucking dead on site.
0:44:44.400000 - 0:44:46.520000::And if you have a movie on my phone.
0:44:46.920000 - 0:44:48.680000::It's called First Person Point of View.
0:44:48.680000 - 0:44:52.640000::I have fucking run full speed into somebody who's gonna get it right on his face.
0:44:52.640000 - 0:44:53.640000::Oh no.
0:44:53.640000 - 0:44:56.440000::And it's a feature film where I'm fucking punching somebody who I don't respect for
0:44:56.440000 - 0:44:57.440000::90 minutes.
0:44:57.440000 - 0:44:58.440000::Right.
0:44:58.440000 - 0:45:00.040000::Well what I'm tired of is this lab in the face.

0:45:00 - 0:45:05.180000::It's a slap in the face to go you all are losers you're too lazy you we all have a mate
0:45:05.180000 - 0:45:09.680000::I may we didn't have cameras as good as the one in your pocket right now. It's 30 years ago. Shut it now
0:45:10.400000 - 0:45:15.080000::Because and these are by the way, I mean you don't want me to go on off on nippo babies. Do you?
0:45:15.520000 - 0:45:19.800000::Well, let me say this let me say that for the patreon world name names
0:45:20.280000 - 0:45:22.280000::More on the culture article whatever
0:45:22.280000 - 0:45:27.320000::I want people that people don't know now. Let's just say we know some people that last names is
0:45:27.960000 - 0:45:29.960000::Who's the guy from the matrix?
0:45:30 - 0:45:32::I can't read
0:45:32 - 0:45:34::We know a couple of reels is that haven't come out yet
0:45:35 - 0:45:40.460000::But yeah, we don't need to go in so hard on Hollywood it people might say it unwise of us to go in
0:45:41.040000 - 0:45:43.040000::savagery style on on Hollywood because
0:45:44.200000 - 0:45:50.560000::Don't drink we keep it was a song. Oh, you know, we need to turn this energy around right now
0:45:50.560000 - 0:45:54.920000::Let's do it put some positivity into the world and do a couple thank calls
0:45:54.920000 - 0:45:58.680000::Thank you for coming
0:45:58.680000 - 0:46:01.360000::Go to what it will be something I'd like to call hi
0:46:01.360000 - 0:46:05.220000::I don't know who to direct this to I just wanted to say I was in your store last week
0:46:05.400000 - 0:46:11::And I've been looking for a bottle of scotch for a long time and y'all had it and you were so helpful and helped me find it
0:46:11 - 0:46:14.520000::And I was finally able to give it to my dad. He's been looking for it for years
0:46:14.520000 - 0:46:19.420000::And I just wanted to pass that on to you guys and say thanks for helping me. I love coming into your shop
0:46:19.420000 - 0:46:21.840000::It always feels so welcoming so thank you
0:46:25.520000 - 0:46:30.160000::Of course, yeah, and just if you could pass that along to the team that would be amazing really appreciate you guys
0:46:31.520000 - 0:46:33.520000::Totally can do that already
0:46:36.320000 - 0:46:42.160000::Thanks now how did I know how that one sound guys that was pro that was pro
0:46:42.160000 - 0:46:46.120000::I was gonna really get at doing it straight up, you know like just being sincere
0:46:47.360000 - 0:46:50.240000::Like because I wanted to say before this that when we did it with Sarah
0:46:50.480000 - 0:46:53.480000::It really went off the rails into the prank territory and how
0:46:53.480000 - 0:46:59.400000::You know when I'm or pray well when a comedian is about like that with such legacy style of
0:46:59.680000 - 0:47:07.840000::Participatory or whatever whatever big words. It's tempting, but now I feel like clean. We're redeeming ourselves. Here should I hit I'll hear it hit it. Yeah, yeah, hit one
0:47:13.800000 - 0:47:20.960000::Hi, I just am calling to say thank you because I purchased a love sack that was the perfect addition to my home and it's been
0:47:21.520000 - 0:47:22.960000::so
0:47:22.960000 - 0:47:27.680000::Incredibly enjoyable and I just had to call and give my gratitude. So I really appreciate it
0:47:36.920000 - 0:47:41.560000::Thank you so much. I appreciate that I appreciate you saying that so have a wonderful day. Thank you
0:47:44.120000 - 0:47:45.640000::Can I that was flawless?
0:47:45.640000 - 0:47:52.240000::Can I just say what I'm feeling with these last two calls and this is starting to get maybe maybe people will find this unethical
0:47:52.480000 - 0:47:57.040000::But but I'm almost wishing they were a little bit more like what kind of love say I did you about like if I was in
0:47:57.040000 - 0:48:01.620000::Not to critique them, but if they were like well who helped maybe they're busy and they got to get on with their day
0:48:01.620000 - 0:48:09.760000::Respect what so I'm like well, I want to know who helped me what's interesting is um, you know, we do these thank calls
0:48:10.680000 - 0:48:19.120000::Hoping that we have a spin on prank calling somebody that sure is it a prank technically maybe but in another sense
0:48:19.800000 - 0:48:26.440000::We are really trying to make these people feel good right and so it feels weird when I can tell that even though I was well intention
0:48:26.440000 - 0:48:28.680000::I did feel like that person
0:48:29.480000 - 0:48:33.720000::Didn't give a fuck about that. It's kind of like sometimes when somebody tells you a good job
0:48:33.720000 - 0:48:37.320000::You didn't need to hear that. It's like I didn't need you to tell me good job
0:48:37.680000 - 0:48:42.300000::I know that I sold you a love sack and it went perfectly and I know you're doing a product and you know
0:48:42.300000 - 0:48:48.120000::We know what my observation is on these two calls we've called some smaller businesses before these were two
0:48:48.320000 - 0:48:53.760000::Major love sack and total wine and more right are major corporations. These people don't have attachment to the
0:48:53.760000 - 0:48:56::The job or the store they don't give a
0:48:56 - 0:49:00.800000::So and and actually good on them for not caring because that's how the worker should be that is true
0:49:00.800000 - 0:49:02.800000::So many next time we should call a
0:49:02.800000 - 0:49:09.140000::To the workers which I call the smallest business we could find well, that's when I get worried too because it's so this is harassment
0:49:09.140000 - 0:49:11.140000::So maybe this is the last thing call
0:49:11.140000 - 0:49:14.340000::We know what why don't we do a friend call a yo
0:49:15.120000 - 0:49:17.360000::Because if we call a celebrity oh
0:49:18.280000 - 0:49:24.520000::Yeah, you know, Zach Graff thank you for all those episodes all the scrubs that I want
0:49:24.520000 - 0:49:28.540000::Those behaviors press in high school. Yeah, all right. Wait. You got one on deck
0:49:28.540000 - 0:49:32.820000::No, still this is next speaking hi Nick. This is Nate
0:49:32.820000 - 0:49:36.360000::I was just giving you guys a call just because I had a
0:49:37.220000 - 0:49:44.160000::French dip at your restaurant recently and I just wanted to say like it was so good
0:49:44.620000 - 0:49:50.140000::Like it was just so fucking good. I thought I'm just gonna call you guys and just let you know like that
0:49:50.140000 - 0:49:53.560000::This was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had and just let you all
0:49:53.560000 - 0:50:00::So nice to you say it. Thank you. We appreciate that of course. I was just like, you know not not enough people get to hear that

0:50:00 - 0:50:04.160000::like you know, you know, on the phone and I was just like,
0:50:04.160000 - 0:50:08.480000::let's just, it was a great, it was one of the best French dips ever.
0:50:08.480000 - 0:50:10.240000::Like I'm just, I'm not even joking.
0:50:10.240000 - 0:50:14::Like I was so, I'm gonna come back and I'm gonna come back again and again and again
0:50:14 - 0:50:16.400000::and eat that French dip over and over because I just loved it.
0:50:16.400000 - 0:50:20.240000::Well thank you, that's so nice and I will definitely let the management know.
0:50:20.240000 - 0:50:24.960000::Yeah, let the chef know too because that, I mean, that would be a real.
0:50:24.960000 - 0:50:26.640000::All right, well thank you so much.
0:50:26.640000 - 0:50:27.920000::We appreciate that.
0:50:28 - 0:50:31.120000::Of course, all right and you have a blessed rest of your week.
0:50:32 - 0:50:32.640000::You as well.
0:50:32.640000 - 0:50:33.200000::Thank you.
0:50:33.200000 - 0:50:33.680000::All right.
0:50:33.680000 - 0:50:34.080000::Thank you.
0:50:34.080000 - 0:50:34.960000::Bye bye.
0:50:34.960000 - 0:50:39.920000::For some reason Nate, that made me hot and maybe want to run into the other room.
0:50:41.680000 - 0:50:44.320000::Well, what's interesting about what their response was.
0:50:44.320000 - 0:50:45.920000::Yeah, you heard what their response was right.
0:50:47.040000 - 0:50:48.880000::They said, oh, that's so great.
0:50:48.880000 - 0:50:50.560000::I'm gonna tell management.
0:50:50.560000 - 0:50:51.200000::Yeah.
0:50:51.200000 - 0:50:51.680000::Yeah.
0:50:51.680000 - 0:50:52.880000::So what do you mean by that?
0:50:52.880000 - 0:50:55.120000::I mean, Nate, by the way, great job.
0:50:56.080000 - 0:50:59.200000::Bottom line, but I did feel some human emotion.
0:50:59.200000 - 0:50:59.920000::There is something.
0:50:59.920000 - 0:51:04.480000::Like, yeah, I was a little facetious, I would say as I was saying it,
0:51:04.480000 - 0:51:05.920000::but you know, they can't really do that.
0:51:05.920000 - 0:51:08.480000::You drop the F word within about 12 seconds.
0:51:08.480000 - 0:51:09.120000::That's fine.
0:51:09.760000 - 0:51:10.880000::That's okay.
0:51:10.880000 - 0:51:13.680000::Some people, when you say fuck to some people,
0:51:13.680000 - 0:51:14.800000::that makes you more human.
0:51:14.800000 - 0:51:16.080000::When you say fuck to other people,
0:51:16.080000 - 0:51:18.160000::that makes you more of a demon devil.
0:51:18.160000 - 0:51:20.880000::Devilish that guy obviously did not like the effort.
0:51:20.880000 - 0:51:24.400000::All right, so maybe next time we'll come back at the thank calls with a different spin on it.
0:51:24.400000 - 0:51:26.400000::We will not give the last time you saw him like this.
0:51:26.400000 - 0:51:29.760000::He's just gonna be a phone it in segment.
0:51:29.760000 - 0:51:30.720000::We're always tuning.
0:51:31.600000 - 0:51:33.360000::Yeah, we're gonna be tuning it up.
0:51:33.360000 - 0:51:36::Yeah, so check it out in a couple months when it's,
0:51:36 - 0:51:37.440000::we're gonna come back with that.
0:51:37.440000 - 0:51:40.480000::So, so we say what we're joyful for and get out of here and get out of here,
0:51:40.480000 - 0:51:42.160000::but we're having an amazing time being here.
0:51:42.160000 - 0:51:44.080000::We could stay here for hours, hours, hours, hours,
0:51:44.080000 - 0:51:45.680000::but you all gotta get back to work.
0:51:45.680000 - 0:51:46.240000::Time to go.
0:51:46.240000 - 0:51:47.200000::It's Tuesday night.
0:51:47.200000 - 0:51:48.960000::There's so many dishes to do and then it's your point.
0:51:48.960000 - 0:51:52.320000::The dishes are going, hey, let us know if you're doing the dishes during this.
0:51:52.320000 - 0:51:52.720000::Please.
0:51:53.680000 - 0:51:54.320000::Please.
0:51:54.320000 - 0:51:56.080000::So what we're thankful for.
0:51:56.080000 - 0:51:56.560000::All right.
0:51:56.560000 - 0:51:57.040000::Here.
0:51:57.040000 - 0:51:57.840000::All, all, all.
0:51:57.840000 - 0:51:58.480000::Oh, no, no.
0:51:58.480000 - 0:51:59.200000::Hey, hey, hey, hey.
0:51:59.200000 - 0:52:05.440000::So today I finished reading a book.
0:52:06.240000 - 0:52:10.400000::And while you get, when you get to that last page and you said,
0:52:10.400000 - 0:52:14.560000::and you're done with that journey, you feel a sense of accomplishment
0:52:15.120000 - 0:52:17.280000::and a sense of pride.
0:52:17.280000 - 0:52:20.720000::And I got to that point where I finished this book that I was reading.
0:52:20.720000 - 0:52:22.160000::It's called Cassandra at the wedding.
0:52:22.320000 - 0:52:23.200000::It's a really good book.
0:52:23.200000 - 0:52:25.200000::It's about 200 some pages.
0:52:25.920000 - 0:52:26.320000::Perfect.
0:52:26.320000 - 0:52:26.720000::Length.
0:52:27.440000 - 0:52:28.240000::Perfect.
0:52:28.240000 - 0:52:28.720000::Perfect.
0:52:28.720000 - 0:52:29.600000::Perfect length.
0:52:29.600000 - 0:52:30.960000::It was, is a great read.
0:52:30.960000 - 0:52:31.840000::I recommend it.
0:52:32.800000 - 0:52:34.160000::And I'm on to the next one.
0:52:34.160000 - 0:52:37.040000::And I immediately picked up my next book of the library.
0:52:37.040000 - 0:52:37.600000::Let's go.
0:52:37.600000 - 0:52:40.880000::That's the way to go is crack that next book right off the bat.
0:52:40.880000 - 0:52:43.200000::Otherwise, you're not reading anymore.
0:52:43.200000 - 0:52:43.600000::Yeah.
0:52:43.600000 - 0:52:44.400000::That's the kind of what I'm doing.
0:52:44.400000 - 0:52:45.680000::Crack that book open.
0:52:46.320000 - 0:52:47.040000::Good for you, Nate.
0:52:47.040000 - 0:52:47.840000::Good for you, Nate.
0:52:47.840000 - 0:52:50.880000::I'll keep it, but we might, maybe we can make this one book theme
0:52:50.880000 - 0:52:54.800000::because I, what if I've read five books
0:52:54.800000 - 0:52:57.120000::since the beginning of the year.
0:52:57.360000 - 0:52:57.920000::Are you serious?
0:52:57.920000 - 0:52:58.960000::Oh my god.
0:52:58.960000 - 0:52:59.440000::Yes.
0:52:59.440000 - 0:53:00.160000::This five book?
0:53:00.160000 - 0:53:00.320000::What?
0:53:01.200000 - 0:53:01.680000::Yes.
0:53:01.680000 - 0:53:02.160000::What length?
0:53:03.120000 - 0:53:06.080000::This is a little bit facetious because I've read.
0:53:06.080000 - 0:53:06.640000::facetious.
0:53:06.640000 - 0:53:06.960000::Three.
0:53:09.360000 - 0:53:11.760000::Okay, because some people will say you didn't actually read that
0:53:11.760000 - 0:53:12.080000::shit, man.
0:53:12.080000 - 0:53:14.640000::It was an audiobook because I'm listening to the audiobooks
0:53:14.640000 - 0:53:16.320000::while I'm walking my dog in the morning.
0:53:17.040000 - 0:53:18.560000::But now, yeah, three of them were.
0:53:18.560000 - 0:53:19.440000::Well, can you tell us here?
0:53:19.440000 - 0:53:20.160000::Tell me if that was the word.
0:53:20.160000 - 0:53:21.920000::Audio books do not count.
0:53:21.920000 - 0:53:22.320000::Sorry.
0:53:22.960000 - 0:53:24.640000::No, I think they count.
0:53:24.640000 - 0:53:25.840000::No, there's this audio.
0:53:25.840000 - 0:53:26.480000::Why don't they count?
0:53:26.480000 - 0:53:28.080000::Because you don't have to imagine what the
0:53:28.080000 - 0:53:29.760000::because the character sounds like.
0:53:29.760000 - 0:53:31.120000::They do not count.
0:53:31.840000 - 0:53:33.040000::Why not, Nate?
0:53:33.040000 - 0:53:34.400000::Because you are listening.
0:53:34.400000 - 0:53:37.760000::There is no, there's no sort of active brain
0:53:37.760000 - 0:53:39.920000::thing going on as you're listening to this shit.
0:53:39.920000 - 0:53:43.280000::When you're reading, your brain is doing the craziest amount
0:53:43.280000 - 0:53:44.480000::of calculations.
0:53:44.480000 - 0:53:46.880000::At least Jack, you can back me up on this, right?
0:53:46.880000 - 0:53:49.040000::As somebody who has an incredibly,
0:53:49.040000 - 0:53:52.880000::incredibly horrible relationship with reading comprehension,
0:53:52.880000 - 0:53:55.440000::I literally just read my first book of my entire life as
0:53:55.440000 - 0:53:56.800000::some of you know on the podcast.
0:53:57.440000 - 0:53:59.200000::And it took me a fucking long time.
0:53:59.200000 - 0:54:01.680000::But as I say this,
0:54:01.920000 - 0:54:03.120000::as I say this,
0:54:04.240000 - 0:54:05.520000::to meet people like me and Nate,
0:54:06.720000 - 0:54:10.320000::listening to an audiobook is so much violently easier than
0:54:10.320000 - 0:54:12.800000::reading a book that it does not feel like a reading.
0:54:12.800000 - 0:54:15.520000::Reading should be painful.
0:54:15.520000 - 0:54:16.480000::It should be.
0:54:16.480000 - 0:54:17.680000::No, it should be.
0:54:17.680000 - 0:54:18.640000::I always said this.
0:54:18.640000 - 0:54:21.680000::Reading should feel like somebody is coming at you from the end
0:54:21.680000 - 0:54:24.960000::of a hallway with a knife and your fucking shoes are tied
0:54:24.960000 - 0:54:25.760000::together.
0:54:25.760000 - 0:54:28.960000::And you're also, you didn't get much sleep and your jeans are wet.
0:54:28.960000 - 0:54:32.240000::It should feel like somebody is grabbing you by the hair
0:54:32.240000 - 0:54:34.640000::and holding your head underwater while they make you watch TV
0:54:35.440000 - 0:54:36.400000::outside of the water.
0:54:36.400000 - 0:54:39.360000::I hate just like a kick to the fucking like flying
0:54:39.360000 - 0:54:41.280000::scissors kick to the fucking nut sack.
0:54:41.280000 - 0:54:43.440000::Every fucking your heart.
0:54:43.440000 - 0:54:45.200000::Stop and listen to me now.
0:54:46.160000 - 0:54:48.640000::I have had to reestablish my
0:54:48.640000 - 0:54:52.080000::relationship with books and reading because I'll tell you why.
0:54:52.080000 - 0:54:54.480000::For the longest time, I would try to read books
0:54:54.480000 - 0:54:55.280000::that were cool.
0:54:55.280000 - 0:54:56.240000::Made me look sick.
0:54:57.040000 - 0:54:58.640000::They weren't reading for the sake of reading.
0:54:58.640000 - 0:54:59.920000::They were reading for the sake

0:55:00 - 0:55:08.720000::of accessories or the flies a little different. That was a masterpiece. But the books that I've
0:55:08.720000 - 0:55:15.280000::been reading in this last year, whatever I'd say eight months, I'm going for just whatever looks
0:55:15.280000 - 0:55:20.720000::fun. I'm going for the mysteries, the sci-fi, the short novels about time travel. So you've trained
0:55:20.720000 - 0:55:26.640000::in quality by my same end of I thought that was pretty okay. But you know what I mean? That's why
0:55:26.640000 - 0:55:32.640000::I think audiobooks let them in book lovers. Let them in. If you don't like the reader, that's okay.
0:55:32.640000 - 0:55:38.400000::Turn it off. But if but sometimes I feel like I'm getting more information from listening because
0:55:38.400000 - 0:55:42.880000::sometimes if I'm reading I skim through some stuff on accident, but you got to listen to the whole
0:55:42.880000 - 0:55:48.160000::thing. That's what I was hearing. I was hearing recently that reading a book is actually that is about
0:55:48.160000 - 0:55:56.240000::to be made old school kind of like using a using a fire instead of a microwave. Why? Because it's so
0:55:56.240000 - 0:55:59.840000::wildly inefficient all the different words you don't need and this and that unless you're reading it
0:55:59.840000 - 0:56:03.600000::for artistic sense, if you're just reading for information, if you're reading philosophy,
0:56:03.600000 - 0:56:08.720000::if you're reading this and that, it's soon to be outdated. That's a shame. Well, it is what it is.
0:56:08.720000 - 0:56:13.760000::That is a damn shame. I accept all growth. What gave you George? I forgot. All right, should I try and
0:56:13.760000 - 0:56:21.200000::make a book themed? Yes. If you could. If you could, that would be amazing. But no pressure.
0:56:21.200000 - 0:56:28.640000::Oh God. You have a hell could I talk about a book this week? I got joy. You know what? This week,
0:56:28.640000 - 0:56:34.320000::I got joy from not reading. I feel like I've been trying to read that's amazing too. I've been trying
0:56:34.320000 - 0:56:39.840000::to I've been spending this whole year. It took me about two months to read about 180 pages and I was
0:56:39.840000 - 0:56:45.520000::doing it every single day. And to have this week where I would make it a part of my morning routine
0:56:45.520000 - 0:56:52.640000::and now my morning routine is more freed up to do things like word unscramble. That yeah,
0:56:52.640000 - 0:56:57.760000::has just made me made me feel a little more fresh. The duality of reading. The reading. Yeah.
0:56:57.760000 - 0:57:03.440000::So interesting. Yeah, by the way, by the way, we are about to drop the joy tactics.
0:57:03.920000 - 0:57:09.760000::Essential reading book club. Essential reading lists list on sign. I think on the Patreon.
0:57:09.760000 - 0:57:14.800000::We need to do it. That'll be at the $100 level. The only people that get this is if you give us
0:57:14.800000 - 0:57:19.360000::a hundred a month. If not, and if you share the list, if you're not in the from the hundred
0:57:19.920000 - 0:57:24::a hundred dollars here, you will be banned and blocked. And if you're for the read for the
0:57:25.680000 - 0:57:29.280000::for the non readers out there, I'm also going to make a list of the most interesting geography
0:57:29.280000 - 0:57:35.360000::YouTube videos about how Mexico's population is, you know, in like a belt basically across
0:57:35.360000 - 0:57:41.200000::the middle of the country. 51% of it is 80% of it. Yeah. Can I say this real quick, Eric, you brought
0:57:41.200000 - 0:57:46.560000::this up for the $100 Patreon tiers. We have, you know, several tiers that you can tap in at
0:57:46.560000 - 0:57:52.720000::$5, $10. And we have one that's $100. Don't we have a $20 as well? We have a $20 that's
0:57:52.720000 - 0:57:59.760000::whatever. We have a hundred dollar. And I just find it so peculiar. That's peculiar peculiar.
0:57:59.760000 - 0:58:07.360000::That we do not have one single person. So you're telling me that we are not worth a hundred
0:58:07.360000 - 0:58:12.320000::dollars a month. Are you fucking kidding me? We don't have that tier yet. I thought we did have a
0:58:12.320000 - 0:58:16.960000::tier for a hundred dollars. No, we just have 20. Yeah. Oh, we don't. We don't. Yeah. No, I don't think
0:58:16.960000 - 0:58:22.080000::we know that's why. So that value yourself. You don't value yourself as a hundred dollars.
0:58:22.080000 - 0:58:28.640000::I don't have a hundred dollars. My ass hurts. So my ass hurts from sitting on the steel still so
0:58:28.640000 - 0:58:33.520000::fucking. I know how's your hands like? Well, my hand actually got used to it. You know, like that guy
0:58:33.520000 - 0:58:37.200000::who held the hand above his head for 40 years. I got all curled up. Well, you should try being a
0:58:37.200000 - 0:58:40.960000::puppeteer if you think that's hard. Because that's right. You know that, well, you know, if you have
0:58:40.960000 - 0:58:48.640000::an hour long stand-up special, which you, which you will very soon, you're going to be having to
0:58:48.640000 - 0:58:54.240000::hold the microphone for, you know, you won't be a problem because I've been working out.
0:58:55.120000 - 0:58:59.440000::Well, we kind of did it again, didn't we? Thanks for listening. God bless you all.
