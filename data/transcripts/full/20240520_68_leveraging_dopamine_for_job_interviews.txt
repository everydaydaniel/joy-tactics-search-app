0:00:00 - 0:00:05::Today's topic is on happiness and dopamine, chemical happiness.
0:00:05 - 0:00:07::Okay?
0:00:07 - 0:00:09::Welcome to Joy Tactics.
0:00:09 - 0:00:16::The podcast dedicated to all things joyful, joyous, and meeting as many celebrities as humanly possible.
0:00:16 - 0:00:20::Hosted by Eric Rahill, Nate Veroni, and Jack Benzinger.
0:00:20 - 0:00:24::Enjoy.
0:00:24 - 0:00:26::Okay.
0:00:26 - 0:00:29::Just silent the rest.
0:00:29 - 0:00:31::Let's just have a...
0:00:31 - 0:00:38::Someone commented that they downloaded the audio so they could isolate my nasal whistle.
0:00:38 - 0:00:46::And you know, you might think that I would be embarrassed by the nasal whistling and breathing, but when I was watching the sopranos, Tony's soprano does...
0:00:46 - 0:00:50::James Gandalfini does that while he's just kind of walking around.
0:00:50 - 0:00:54::And I think it indicated poor health due to his early passing.
0:00:54 - 0:01:01::But it also called me and when I was younger, I would try to do that on purpose.
0:01:01 - 0:01:04::Because I found it so like relaxing.
0:01:04 - 0:01:06::Yeah, I found it soothing.
0:01:06 - 0:01:10::So now to know that my body's just doing it for me is a gift from God.
0:01:10 - 0:01:13::And by the way, if you are...
0:01:13 - 0:01:17::You just think this is like you can hear the breathing.
0:01:17 - 0:01:22::I mean, you see the microphone is probably, you know, like a couple inches away from...
0:01:22 - 0:01:29::If you're around Eric IRL in real life, this extends like his...
0:01:29 - 0:01:33::The sound waves of his breathing extend, I would say, about...
0:01:33 - 0:01:42::He probably has like a nine foot radius around him where you can kind of hear the nasal breathing.
0:01:42 - 0:01:45::And it's like when you walk into the calm...
0:01:45 - 0:01:47::It kind of brings a calm...
0:01:47 - 0:01:50::Video games sound like an area sound.
0:01:50 - 0:01:51::Yeah, right.
0:01:51 - 0:01:53::I've heard that before you see it.
0:01:53 - 0:01:56::If you're playing like a stealth game where you got to get...
0:01:56 - 0:01:58::We hide from the boss so you can...
0:01:58 - 0:02:01::You know, whatever get away with not doing work.
0:02:01 - 0:02:03::Yeah, the breathing is an indicator.
0:02:03 - 0:02:06::Eric trying video game where Eric's trying to snatch your burritos.
0:02:06 - 0:02:07::Here.
0:02:07 - 0:02:08::Oh man.
0:02:08 - 0:02:09::Yeah.
0:02:09 - 0:02:10::Let's watch out.
0:02:10 - 0:02:12::Let's stop it with the burrito shit, man.
0:02:12 - 0:02:13::Like not funny.
0:02:13 - 0:02:14::I had a great burrito, but all right.
0:02:15 - 0:02:16::Oh, I did too.
0:02:16 - 0:02:17::I've had a...
0:02:17 - 0:02:20::I've had two great burritos this week.
0:02:20 - 0:02:21::That's amazing.
0:02:21 - 0:02:23::Well, one with Nate.
0:02:23 - 0:02:25::That was put on to the...
0:02:25 - 0:02:27::On to the Instagram.
0:02:27 - 0:02:28::Yeah.
0:02:28 - 0:02:30::And where did you have a burrito, Jack?
0:02:30 - 0:02:32::Ursula's.
0:02:32 - 0:02:33::Delicious.
0:02:33 - 0:02:35::Ursula's house.
0:02:35 - 0:02:37::In Bedford's Diversant.
0:02:37 - 0:02:38::Quite delicious.
0:02:38 - 0:02:39::This is...
0:02:39 - 0:02:42::So then...
0:02:43 - 0:02:45::I did want to...
0:02:45 - 0:02:47::I know it's a bit early in the podcast,
0:02:47 - 0:02:51::but I did want to get deep in on this topic really deep.
0:02:51 - 0:02:52::Concerningly.
0:02:52 - 0:02:53::Right, right.
0:02:53 - 0:02:55::In a way that's just...
0:02:55 - 0:02:57::All right, so...
0:02:57 - 0:03:00::The breathing calming you.
0:03:00 - 0:03:11::I just think it's interesting how a lot of things that give us dopamine and give us happiness are things that are leading us closer to rejoining with the great beyond.
0:03:11 - 0:03:13::You know what I'm saying.
0:03:13 - 0:03:14::It's just that I'm...
0:03:14 - 0:03:17::You're saying that my...
0:03:17 - 0:03:18::I'm saying that.
0:03:18 - 0:03:23::You're saying that my labored breathing, which indicates maybe poor heart health and poor respiratory function.
0:03:23 - 0:03:25::Pulmonary disease.
0:03:25 - 0:03:29::Pulmonary disease and pulmonary disease and likely very high blood pressure.
0:03:29 - 0:03:30::No.
0:03:30 - 0:03:34::That actually is calming me and people around me.
0:03:34 - 0:03:37::So, once again, lady...
0:03:37 - 0:03:39::Justice is...
0:03:39 - 0:03:41::Or whatever, the one with the scales.
0:03:41 - 0:03:44::The scales are constantly being leveled.
0:03:44 - 0:03:45::Right.
0:03:45 - 0:03:46::You know what I'm saying?
0:03:46 - 0:03:47::It's people liberalized.
0:03:47 - 0:03:48::No matter what it is.
0:03:48 - 0:03:49::There's...
0:03:49 - 0:03:52::There's just such a great balance to the universe that makes me say,
0:03:52 - 0:03:54::slap up the creator.
0:03:54 - 0:03:56::Thank you for making this shit make sense.
0:03:56 - 0:03:57::And, slap up the creator.
0:03:57 - 0:03:58::You know what I mean?
0:03:58 - 0:03:59::I mean, they're more dynamics as well.
0:03:59 - 0:04:00::Dapthos up as well.
0:04:00 - 0:04:03::In such an implausible existence.
0:04:03 - 0:04:05::And yet it's the only thing that...
0:04:05 - 0:04:08::Poges up as well because it's all that exists around us is what I'm saying.
0:04:08 - 0:04:09::Bride.
0:04:09 - 0:04:16::And you rockin' around basically operating at a 24-7 death rattle style breathing.
0:04:16 - 0:04:19::It would be a full reminder.
0:04:19 - 0:04:22::Have you guys ever heard of death, Rattle, in person?
0:04:22 - 0:04:23::Hi.
0:04:23 - 0:04:26::I heard a close call one, yeah.
0:04:26 - 0:04:27::I've heard it.
0:04:27 - 0:04:28::I've heard that shit.
0:04:28 - 0:04:29::Well, you've heard it.
0:04:29 - 0:04:30::You've induced it.
0:04:30 - 0:04:32::Rattle, put someone into your throat.
0:04:32 - 0:04:33::Do you get it?
0:04:33 - 0:04:39::Do you hit a death rattle if you're like sniped in the fuckin' forehead?
0:04:39 - 0:04:40::Or is it just...
0:04:40 - 0:04:42::When did the death rattle happen?
0:04:42 - 0:04:45::Like if you're just kinda going to the hospital, that's when I imagine.
0:04:45 - 0:04:46::No.
0:04:46 - 0:04:49::If your brainstem is...
0:04:49 - 0:04:50::Yeah.
0:04:50 - 0:04:51::Central nervous system.
0:04:51 - 0:04:52::You know what I mean?
0:04:52 - 0:04:53::Severed or something.
0:04:53 - 0:04:56::If the central nervous system is fucked up, then no.
0:04:56 - 0:04:58::Your body just shuts down immediately.
0:04:58 - 0:05:00::Like a computer being unplugged.

0:05:00 - 0:05:02.360000::from what I can remember for my studies.
0:05:02.360000 - 0:05:06.480000::But if that's just intact, then yeah, your body's gonna try
0:05:06.480000 - 0:05:07.400000::to keep you alive.
0:05:07.400000 - 0:05:08.640000::You know what I'm saying?
0:05:08.640000 - 0:05:12::And so, and it's so sweet.
0:05:12 - 0:05:13.320000::The death metal is so sweet.
0:05:13.320000 - 0:05:14.600000::It's trying to stay alive.
0:05:15.960000 - 0:05:17.120000::I'm not a different one.
0:05:17.120000 - 0:05:20.040000::One line would be, I can only give you a short snippet
0:05:20.040000 - 0:05:23::of it, but just know the word is last.
0:05:23 - 0:05:25.640000::It would last like days, you know,
0:05:25.640000 - 0:05:28.680000::like it's not gonna be just a rattle.
0:05:28.680000 - 0:05:31.480000::It's gonna be like April.
0:05:31.480000 - 0:05:34.120000::People are gonna be like just trying to like,
0:05:34.120000 - 0:05:36.800000::like is he, like I think he should die, you know,
0:05:36.800000 - 0:05:38.400000::like I think he should go.
0:05:38.400000 - 0:05:40.280000::Yeah, his vitals have stopped.
0:05:40.280000 - 0:05:41.360000::Vital stopped, that we could go.
0:05:41.360000 - 0:05:44::He's in the casket, but he's still vibrated.
0:05:44 - 0:05:45.080000::Yeah, yeah, yeah.
0:05:45.080000 - 0:05:47.480000::I'm like underground like, fuck, I don't know anything.
0:05:47.480000 - 0:05:48.320000::What's the music?
0:05:50.560000 - 0:05:53.400000::And this would be, this would be my death metal.
0:05:53.400000 - 0:05:54.680000::Mm-hmm.
0:05:54.680000 - 0:05:55.520000::Mm-hmm.
0:05:55.520000 - 0:05:56.360000::Mm-hmm.
0:05:58.680000 - 0:05:59.520000::That's okay.
0:05:59.520000 - 0:06:00.360000::That's okay.
0:06:00.360000 - 0:06:01.360000::My family starts crying.
0:06:01.360000 - 0:06:02.200000::Yeah.
0:06:02.200000 - 0:06:03.040000::Mm-hmm.
0:06:03.040000 - 0:06:03.880000::He's alive still.
0:06:03.880000 - 0:06:04.720000::No, he's not.
0:06:04.720000 - 0:06:05.720000::He said this would happen.
0:06:05.720000 - 0:06:07.040000::No, no, this is the end.
0:06:07.040000 - 0:06:07.880000::Yeah.
0:06:09.880000 - 0:06:10.560000::Wow.
0:06:10.560000 - 0:06:12.680000::Holier is hilarious.
0:06:12.680000 - 0:06:13.960000::Mm-hmm.
0:06:13.960000 - 0:06:16.520000::I would be perfectly happy to do a full episode
0:06:16.520000 - 0:06:18.680000::zero talking just beat boxing.
0:06:19.960000 - 0:06:21.960000::And we should have, absolutely.
0:06:24.200000 - 0:06:25.760000::Yes, oh my God.
0:06:25.760000 - 0:06:26.600000::Okay.
0:06:26.600000 - 0:06:27.440000::Okay.
0:06:27.440000 - 0:06:28.440000::Boom.
0:06:28.440000 - 0:06:29.280000::Boom.
0:06:29.280000 - 0:06:30.120000::Yeah.
0:06:30.120000 - 0:06:31.120000::Show it to me, Rachel.
0:06:31.120000 - 0:06:32.120000::Mm-hmm.
0:06:32.120000 - 0:06:33.120000::Yeah.
0:06:33.120000 - 0:06:34.120000::That's a good one.
0:06:34.120000 - 0:06:35.280000::What is that?
0:06:35.280000 - 0:06:37.040000::That's that new TikTok.
0:06:37.040000 - 0:06:38.160000::Or that's about a year old.
0:06:38.160000 - 0:06:39.680000::You've seen that shit where the mom is like,
0:06:39.680000 - 0:06:41::thinks that Jesus is.
0:06:42.360000 - 0:06:44.280000::The daughter goes like, mom, they found Jesus
0:06:44.280000 - 0:06:45.720000::and outside of Ohio and something.
0:06:45.720000 - 0:06:47::And she immediately starts crying.
0:06:47 - 0:06:49.680000::She goes, show it to me, Rachel.
0:06:49.680000 - 0:06:50.520000::You haven't seen this?
0:06:50.520000 - 0:06:54.320000::I have a toch.no style show where you don't show clips.
0:06:54.320000 - 0:06:55.520000::You just kind of describe.
0:06:55.520000 - 0:06:56.840000::Just breakdown by the way.
0:06:56.840000 - 0:06:57.680000::Have you guys seen this?
0:06:57.680000 - 0:06:58.680000::Medieval toch.no.
0:06:58.680000 - 0:06:59.680000::Have you guys seen this?
0:06:59.680000 - 0:07:00.880000::The campfire toch.no.
0:07:00.880000 - 0:07:01.720000::Ha-ha-ha.
0:07:03.920000 - 0:07:05.680000::Oh, that's a bit funny.
0:07:05.680000 - 0:07:07.880000::So all of these things that we're talking about,
0:07:07.880000 - 0:07:09.320000::you saw it, you see the laughter,
0:07:09.320000 - 0:07:11.360000::you see the physical smile on my face
0:07:11.360000 - 0:07:13.120000::if you're watching the video.
0:07:13.120000 - 0:07:18.120000::You are seeing a flood of dopamine hitting the receptors.
0:07:18.120000 - 0:07:19.560000::In real time.
0:07:19.560000 - 0:07:23.760000::You think that this is just all spiritual, all fun?
0:07:23.760000 - 0:07:25.280000::No, this is chemical.
0:07:25.280000 - 0:07:27.400000::This is a science, okay?
0:07:27.400000 - 0:07:28.240000::Yeah.
0:07:28.240000 - 0:07:30.080000::Speaking of chemical science.
0:07:30.080000 - 0:07:31.640000::Should we get into the breakdown
0:07:31.640000 - 0:07:34.120000::of what dopamine kind of does for the body?
0:07:34.120000 - 0:07:36.560000::Because I know a lot of people are,
0:07:36.560000 - 0:07:40.240000::sure, high school dropouts who listen to this.
0:07:40.240000 - 0:07:41.080000::I got it.
0:07:41.080000 - 0:07:43.520000::And might have not had that, you know,
0:07:43.520000 - 0:07:47.800000::that deep level of chemistry,
0:07:47.800000 - 0:07:51.080000::307 in college that we had.
0:07:51.080000 - 0:07:54.880000::So dopamine is a chemical that's produced in a brain,
0:07:54.880000 - 0:07:56.560000::okay, in the brain.
0:07:56.560000 - 0:08:00.160000::And it plays a role in these functions.
0:08:00.160000 - 0:08:05.160000::Motivation, mood, movement, and memory.
0:08:06.960000 - 0:08:10.800000::And there all starts with the letter M, interesting.
0:08:10.800000 - 0:08:12.920000::And I don't think that's a coincidence.
0:08:13.880000 - 0:08:18::The sort of etymology of these things.
0:08:18 - 0:08:19.960000::And you're trying to figure out what that coincidence is,
0:08:19.960000 - 0:08:22.200000::but it definitely is.
0:08:22.200000 - 0:08:23.040000::It's there.
0:08:23.040000 - 0:08:24.040000::You know what I'm saying?
0:08:24.040000 - 0:08:28.960000::Well, you can't not recognize that there is a coincidence there.
0:08:28.960000 - 0:08:30.760000::So motivation.
0:08:34.480000 - 0:08:36.520000::I'll just put it down like this, okay?
0:08:36.520000 - 0:08:41.520000::Dopamine is what is the tactic that our brain uses
0:08:41.680000 - 0:08:45.680000::to keep us alive, healthy, happy, and have sex, right?
0:08:50.280000 - 0:08:53.360000::And procreate and keeping the bloodline going.
0:08:53.360000 - 0:08:54.360000::You see what I'm saying?
0:08:54.360000 - 0:08:57.640000::If it weren't for dopamine, we'd all be on the fucking bed
0:08:57.640000 - 0:09:02.400000::just rotting to death, which is what I've never done.
0:09:04.240000 - 0:09:07.560000::Dopamine gets us up, it gets us going to the club.
0:09:07.560000 - 0:09:11.040000::It gets us wanting to chat with beautiful ladies or men,
0:09:11.120000 - 0:09:12.880000::or whatever you're interested in.
0:09:13.920000 - 0:09:17.360000::And then you marry that person and then you have children.

0:11:48.040000 - 0:11:49.960000::What did they do to your ass, dude?
0:11:49.960000 - 0:11:52::Well, I went to them with a business proposal.
0:11:52 - 0:11:53.960000::I said, I can change your entire life.
0:11:53.960000 - 0:11:54.960000::It's...
0:11:54.960000 - 0:11:55.960000::I could change your whole business.
0:11:55.960000 - 0:11:58.960000::I can make you guys more money than you've ever seen in your entire life.
0:11:58.960000 - 0:12:00.600000::I went in condition.
0:12:00.600000 - 0:12:01.920000::You give me a job here.
0:12:01.920000 - 0:12:04.680000::And they said, okay, we'll call you on Friday.
0:12:04.680000 - 0:12:07.960000::We'll guess what, dude.
0:12:07.960000 - 0:12:08.960000::They didn't.
0:12:08.960000 - 0:12:09.960000::What?
0:12:09.960000 - 0:12:11.800000::And I don't know...
0:12:11.800000 - 0:12:16.560000::I mean, my first instinct was to call 911.
0:12:16.560000 - 0:12:17.560000::Because I thought...
0:12:17.560000 - 0:12:18.760000::Oh, what was the proposition, dude?
0:12:18.760000 - 0:12:25.240000::The proposition was that I invented a new business where I go up to tables and ask people
0:12:25.240000 - 0:12:27.360000::what they want to eat.
0:12:27.360000 - 0:12:33::And then I punch it into a POS system.
0:12:33 - 0:12:36::It's a POS, this is a new thing that I'm inventing.
0:12:36 - 0:12:37::But...
0:12:37 - 0:12:38::Right, point.
0:12:38 - 0:12:39::Basically...
0:12:39 - 0:12:40::Right.
0:12:40 - 0:12:41::No, you...
0:12:41 - 0:12:42::Well, yeah, point of...
0:12:42 - 0:12:43.200000::I can't say what the S is for, but it's very stupid.
0:12:43.200000 - 0:12:44.700000::But yeah.
0:12:44.700000 - 0:12:50.220000::And maybe they're too stupid or ignorant or purely evil to have not understood how smart
0:12:50.220000 - 0:12:52.420000::I am.
0:12:52.420000 - 0:12:53.420000::But yeah.
0:12:53.420000 - 0:13:00.100000::First, I'm going to walk in there, take everybody's pulse, make sure everybody's healthy.
0:13:00.100000 - 0:13:02.660000::And then they better hope they're not healthy.
0:13:02.660000 - 0:13:03.660000::Uh-huh.
0:13:03.660000 - 0:13:04.660000::Because if I find out...
0:13:04.660000 - 0:13:06.540000::Did you really go in, Jack, and do this?
0:13:06.540000 - 0:13:10.020000::Yes, I did, and I gave them my resume.
0:13:10.020000 - 0:13:11.020000::Which is very...
0:13:11.020000 - 0:13:12.020000::Where was the place?
0:13:12.020000 - 0:13:13.020000::Do we...
0:13:13.020000 - 0:13:14.500000::Have we all been there together recently?
0:13:14.500000 - 0:13:17.380000::No, we haven't.
0:13:17.380000 - 0:13:18.380000::You've...
0:13:18.380000 - 0:13:19.380000::I don't think you've ever been there.
0:13:19.380000 - 0:13:20.380000::So hold on.
0:13:20.380000 - 0:13:21.380000::You?
0:13:21.380000 - 0:13:23.140000::So you went into this place and said, I'm going to...
0:13:23.140000 - 0:13:25.340000::I have a new thing where I can...
0:13:25.340000 - 0:13:26.340000::Check circles.
0:13:26.340000 - 0:13:27.340000::Heart rate.
0:13:27.340000 - 0:13:28.340000::And...
0:13:28.340000 - 0:13:29.340000::What?
0:13:29.340000 - 0:13:33.740000::Use a something that already does exist in the world of...
0:13:33.740000 - 0:13:34.740000::Nate, Jack went...
0:13:34.740000 - 0:13:35.740000::Of the old equistom.
0:13:35.740000 - 0:13:36.740000::Nate.
0:13:36.740000 - 0:13:39.540000::Nate, and Jack went in and applied to be a waiter.
0:13:39.540000 - 0:13:40.540000::At this spot.
0:13:40.540000 - 0:13:41.540000::Mm-hmm.
0:13:41.540000 - 0:13:43.540000::And they said, hell no.
0:13:43.540000 - 0:13:44.540000::That's a very...
0:13:44.540000 - 0:13:45.540000::Wow.
0:13:45.540000 - 0:13:50.540000::That's a very layman's way to explain it.

0:14:51.420000 - 0:14:53.420000::Well, that's because you're a competitor.
0:14:53.420000 - 0:14:55.420000::Why would you follow a competitor?
0:14:55.420000 - 0:14:56.420000::Man.

0:15:48.800000 - 0:15:52.640000::So what I'm saying is how about one of Dave Vitamins
0:15:52.640000 - 0:15:54.320000::where there's shapes like oxy-cutton
0:15:54.320000 - 0:15:57.160000::and they come in oxy prescription bottles.
0:15:57.160000 - 0:15:58::Okay.
0:15:58.840000 - 0:16:00.320000::But it's just regular.

0:16:08.240000 - 0:16:09.320000::That's a ginger shot.
0:16:09.320000 - 0:16:12.960000::Vitamins should be thinking of a core potency
0:16:12.960000 - 0:16:14.560000::sea buckthorn shot.
0:16:14.560000 - 0:16:15.600000::What the fuck is that?
0:16:15.600000 - 0:16:16.560000::That's amazing.
0:16:16.560000 - 0:16:19.200000::That's a thorn that was in a deer.
0:16:19.200000 - 0:16:21.600000::If you know, you know, okay?
0:16:23.080000 - 0:16:25.720000::And list off the ingredients in that for me.
0:16:26.680000 - 0:16:28.680000::What is in that?
0:16:28.680000 - 0:16:31.240000::It's natural orange juice, pineapple juice,
0:16:31.240000 - 0:16:32.640000::sea buckthorn juice.
0:16:32.640000 - 0:16:34.640000::That's where you get the real nutrients.
0:16:34.640000 - 0:16:36.120000::Lemon juice,
0:16:36.120000 - 0:16:37.720000::the juice of a sea buckthorn.

0:16:40.320000 - 0:16:42.480000::Oh, you know, Bob, Baobob trees, right?
0:16:43.960000 - 0:16:46.120000::It was a, yeah, I think it was a little bit of a
0:16:46.120000 - 0:16:47.240000::little bit of a tree.
0:16:47.240000 - 0:16:50.320000::That's kind of Portuguese-a style tree.
0:16:50.320000 - 0:16:55.320000::I feel like the lot of those type of trees are found.
0:16:55.320000 - 0:16:57.640000::Great knowledge of different trees.
0:16:57.640000 - 0:16:59.280000::It's outstanding, but you.

0:17:01.760000 - 0:17:02.600000::Ha, ha, ha.
0:17:05.200000 - 0:17:09.760000::So sea buckthorn can act as a blood thinner causing
0:17:09.760000 - 0:17:10.440000::bleeding.
0:17:10.440000 - 0:17:12.520000::It may also cause low blood sugar.
0:17:14.280000 - 0:17:15.120000::Yeah.
0:17:15.120000 - 0:17:18.200000::It has a lot of negative interactions
0:17:18.200000 - 0:17:20.480000::combining it with blood thinning drugs
0:17:20.480000 - 0:17:22.720000::or supplements could raise your risk
0:17:22.720000 - 0:17:25.200000::of blood related emergencies.
0:17:25.200000 - 0:17:27.800000::This is going to kill you or what you should take
0:17:27.800000 - 0:17:29.160000::out of it after taking that.
0:17:30.840000 - 0:17:34.080000::You need to, God, you need to cut out the Advil, man.
0:17:35.080000 - 0:17:36.080000::No, man, it's good.
0:17:36.080000 - 0:17:39.240000::I take it with my fucking vitamin C every morning.
0:17:39.240000 - 0:17:41.520000::Vitamin C, four Advil.
0:17:41.520000 - 0:17:44.120000::You put it in like a cereal mixture with some
0:17:44.120000 - 0:17:44.960000::of the milk.
0:17:44.960000 - 0:17:46.840000::I blended up into a smoothie with skim milk.
0:17:46.840000 - 0:17:48.880000::Ha, ha, ha, ha.
0:17:48.880000 - 0:17:51.480000::Skim milk and liquid gel.

0:18:04.960000 - 0:18:05.800000::Alcohol, Advil.
0:18:05.800000 - 0:18:07.640000::Oh, these things that we're talking about.

0:18:21.960000 - 0:18:23.560000::You know how you see in the cartoons?
0:18:23.600000 - 0:18:25.400000::Of course, throw them in your mouth.
0:18:25.400000 - 0:18:29.920000::If you had a beer like the amount of, okay, hold up.
0:18:29.920000 - 0:18:34.920000::The amount of pills that you would have to take to constitute
0:18:36.440000 - 0:18:39.480000::an entire beer would be a lot.
0:18:39.480000 - 0:18:42.280000::You know, so you'd really be having to throw them fuckers
0:18:42.280000 - 0:18:43.120000::in your mouth.
0:18:43.120000 - 0:18:44.880000::Well, no, you're missing the fun.
0:18:44.880000 - 0:18:48.480000::Yes, but you're missing what's so wonderful about pills

0:18:52.040000 - 0:18:54.540000::So you can put, you know, 1000 proof,
0:18:54.540000 - 0:18:56.480000::one out there in a pillow.
0:18:56.480000 - 0:18:57.840000::One pill?
0:18:57.840000 - 0:18:58.680000::Yes.
0:18:58.680000 - 0:18:59.520000::That level of out there.
0:18:59.520000 - 0:19:00.360000::I've got a thousand gone there.
0:19:00.360000 - 0:19:02.120000::Yeah, I refuse to believe that.
0:19:02.120000 - 0:19:02.960000::Come over.
0:19:02.960000 - 0:19:03.800000::Come over.
0:19:03.800000 - 0:19:04.640000::What?
0:19:04.640000 - 0:19:06.160000::This is my restaurant pitch.
0:19:06.160000 - 0:19:08.520000::And by the way, my dope, this is all circling back
0:19:08.520000 - 0:19:11.520000::to dope a, dope of me and feeling good chemicals.
0:19:11.520000 - 0:19:14.280000::But we, if we had a restaurant, maybe sort of like a bond

0:19:16.920000 - 0:19:19.480000::Oh, but we don't serve alcohol, right?
0:19:19.480000 - 0:19:21.880000::So people are initially turned off.
0:19:21.880000 - 0:19:24.960000::Oh, what we do have is pills that you can take.
0:19:24.960000 - 0:19:28.560000::So at the beginning of the meal, you take an oxy.
0:19:28.560000 - 0:19:33.560000::Well, 30 minutes in, you're popping a damn,
0:19:33.560000 - 0:19:36.800000::you know, 800 muscle gram ibuprofen.
0:19:36.800000 - 0:19:38.400000::A muscle relaxer.
0:19:38.400000 - 0:19:40.240000::At the end of the meal, you're hitting,
0:19:40.240000 - 0:19:41.720000::can you imagine if we could just,
0:19:41.720000 - 0:19:43.400000::you could just feel that shit for 20 minutes
0:19:43.400000 - 0:19:45.240000::and then press a button that flushes your blood.
0:19:45.240000 - 0:19:46.080000::Next.
0:19:46.080000 - 0:19:48.320000::Oh, that would be hell of a,
0:19:48.320000 - 0:19:49.160000::I didn't realize that.
0:19:49.160000 - 0:19:50.680000::Well, you know, we could, we could,
0:19:51 - 0:19:51.520000::we had to flush the bed.
0:19:51.520000 - 0:19:54.760000::A spot like this if we all moved to Mexico.
0:19:56.040000 - 0:19:57::Right with the firmness.
0:19:57 - 0:19:59.480000::Why are we, I think we should, yeah,

0:20:10.480000 - 0:20:13.440000::I moved to Mexico right now.
0:20:13.440000 - 0:20:14.480000::Yeah.
0:20:14.480000 - 0:20:15.800000::You're in Guadalajara right now.
0:20:15.800000 - 0:20:18.360000::I am in Guadalajara right now.
0:20:18.360000 - 0:20:21.880000::Six stories underground with a fake light coming through my window.

0:20:24.640000 - 0:20:27.280000::But yeah, this process has already begun.
0:20:27.280000 - 0:20:29.680000::Let's just say, yeah.
0:20:29.680000 - 0:20:33.600000::You started a crypto farm like eight years too late.
0:20:33.600000 - 0:20:35.520000::And based on in Guadalajara.
0:20:35.520000 - 0:20:39.240000::I started a RuneScape gold farming community where I was a bunch of us are in here trying
0:20:39.240000 - 0:20:41.760000::to sell online product.
0:20:41.760000 - 0:20:44.680000::I was actually looking into crypto farming.
0:20:44.680000 - 0:20:46.440000::Go ahead.
0:20:46.440000 - 0:20:47.120000::No, no, no, no.
0:20:47.120000 - 0:20:50.320000::Recista one of our enemies is playing RuneScape.
0:20:50.320000 - 0:20:51.160000::Caleb Pitts.
0:20:51.160000 - 0:20:53.440000::Oh, you found him on RuneScape.
0:20:53.440000 - 0:20:54.240000::I did.
0:20:54.240000 - 0:20:55.240000::I found him playing RuneScape.
0:20:55.240000 - 0:20:56.760000::What's his, what's his username?
0:20:56.760000 - 0:20:57.960000::What's his username?
0:20:57.960000 - 0:20:59.240000::I don't, I don't want to dox him.
0:20:59.240000 - 0:21:00.880000::But it's a right.
0:21:00.880000 - 0:21:04.560000::Yeah, I can't remember, but it's creative.
0:21:04.560000 - 0:21:05.560000::It's quite a lot of us.
0:21:05.560000 - 0:21:09::With crypto farming, you know what the problem is?
0:21:09 - 0:21:11.600000::It's the power that it uses.
0:21:11.600000 - 0:21:15.040000::The power of the computer.
0:21:15.040000 - 0:21:19.080000::You just ate a cherry tomato.
0:21:19.080000 - 0:21:21.680000::A marble.
0:21:21.680000 - 0:21:23.680000::Honey bombs, tomatoes.

0:21:26.680000 - 0:21:27.680000::Oh my God.
0:21:28.560000 - 0:21:30.360000::They're so fucking, you never had flavor bombs
0:21:30.360000 - 0:21:33.800000::or sugar bombs made by sunset tomatoes.
0:21:33.800000 - 0:21:36.160000::I've had a very off-putting breakfast.
0:21:38.360000 - 0:21:40.160000::I had about three servings of tofu
0:21:40.160000 - 0:21:42.920000::and a giant bag of caramel popcorn.
0:21:42.920000 - 0:21:44.440000::And now I don't feel so good.
0:21:48.440000 - 0:21:50.720000::Right hitting the gym today, Jack, getting that dopamine.
0:21:50.720000 - 0:21:52::Because you got that quick dopamine,

0:21:53.720000 - 0:21:54.920000::and that tofu?
0:21:54.920000 - 0:21:56.960000::That tofu was not very fresh.
0:21:57.640000 - 0:21:59.640000::That was a very short dopamine trip.
0:22:03.320000 - 0:22:05.280000::I haven't hit the gym in about two months
0:22:05.280000 - 0:22:09.120000::since I saw that guy getting a severe accident in Canada.
0:22:09.120000 - 0:22:12.280000::But I'm gonna be on it soon.
0:22:14.200000 - 0:22:15.960000::Liquid I got.

0:22:23.560000 - 0:22:26.280000::I don't know if I really needed this
0:22:26.280000 - 0:22:29.080000::as a bald guy, but I got a swim cat.
0:22:29.080000 - 0:22:30.880000::Should we go swimming today, Nate?
0:22:30.880000 - 0:22:33.560000::Should we go hit the Hawaii today, go swimming?
0:22:33.560000 - 0:22:37.040000::Wow, that might be down to do that actually.
0:22:37.040000 - 0:22:38.040000::That sounds good.
0:22:38.040000 - 0:22:39.200000::You guys are an inspiration.
0:22:39.200000 - 0:22:41.960000::Don't you, maybe I should try this on right now,
0:22:41.960000 - 0:22:42.880000::the swim cat.
0:22:42.880000 - 0:22:43.720000::Oh please.
0:22:43.720000 - 0:22:45.040000::There's no, you have no choice.
0:22:45.040000 - 0:22:46.040000::Put it on your nuts.
0:22:46.040000 - 0:22:48.280000::And then I could tell a story about the guy
0:22:48.280000 - 0:22:49.840000::that this like kind of,
0:22:51.040000 - 0:22:53.640000::I think he was addicted to some sort of meth

0:27:48 - 0:27:49::Dude, you know, piss is gone.
0:27:49 - 0:27:50::I fucking hate that when I did
0:27:50 - 0:27:52::swim team in high school, which I
0:27:52 - 0:27:53::sucked at.
0:27:53 - 0:27:57::I was in the second slowest lane.
0:27:57 - 0:27:59::So the slowest lane was like
0:27:59 - 0:28:01::really slow, but I was in the
0:28:01 - 0:28:02::second slowest lane.
0:28:02 - 0:28:04::And there was this kid who
0:28:04 - 0:28:05::never cut his toenails.
0:28:05 - 0:28:07::One time he's kicking his
0:28:07 - 0:28:08::arm breaststroke.
0:28:08 - 0:28:10::And I'm going the other way.
0:28:10 - 0:28:12::And he sliced my leg open with his
0:28:12 - 0:28:13::toenails.
0:28:13 - 0:28:14::Oh, yeah.
0:28:14 - 0:28:15::Yo.
0:28:15 - 0:28:17::Not like a crazy house.
0:28:17 - 0:28:18::So much.
0:28:18 - 0:28:20::But definitely like a cut on my
0:28:20 - 0:28:21::toenail.
0:28:21 - 0:28:22::It's disgusting.
0:28:22 - 0:28:23::Yeah.
0:28:23 - 0:28:24::A sharp toenail is so disgusting.
0:28:24 - 0:28:25::Because nobody nobody with a
0:28:25 - 0:28:27::sharp toenail has like a nice
0:28:27 - 0:28:28::toenail.
0:28:28 - 0:28:29::Like it's always like no, it's
0:28:29 - 0:28:30::all like mortified yellow.
0:28:30 - 0:28:31::Like just disfigured.
0:28:31 - 0:28:32::I know, man.
0:28:32 - 0:28:33::I fucking know.
0:28:33 - 0:28:35::So yeah, that happened to me.
0:28:35 - 0:28:36::What else?
0:28:36 - 0:28:37::What else, man?
0:28:37 - 0:28:38::What else?
0:28:38 - 0:28:39::What else?
0:28:39 - 0:28:40::What else?
0:28:40 - 0:28:41::What else?
0:28:41 - 0:28:42::What happened?
0:28:42 - 0:28:43::Can we have underwater?
0:28:43 - 0:28:44::Hmm.
0:28:44 - 0:28:45::You could have.
0:28:45 - 0:28:46::Well, you can have.
0:28:47 - 0:28:49::Why don't we utilize like the fin?
0:28:49 - 0:28:51::Are the back fin?
0:28:51 - 0:28:52::Dorsal fish.
0:28:52 - 0:28:53::Right.
0:28:53 - 0:28:55::Well, no one's thought about it.
0:28:55 - 0:28:57::No one's thought of a fish.
0:28:57 - 0:28:58::The carbon fiber fin.
0:28:58 - 0:28:59::We're in the carbon fiber fin to the
0:28:59 - 0:29:00::Y. Jim.
0:29:00 - 0:29:04::The web, the web fingers.
0:29:04 - 0:29:06::Because all of these things we're
0:29:06 - 0:29:08::trying to, that's how we discovered
0:29:08 - 0:29:10::flight was through studying birds
0:29:10 - 0:29:12::and how they do it.
0:29:12 - 0:29:13::Right.
0:29:13 - 0:29:15::And we're adapting a lot of the
0:29:15 - 0:29:20::naturalistic animal features to
0:29:20 - 0:29:25::to whatever underwater or air.
0:29:25 - 0:29:26::You know what I'm saying?
0:29:26 - 0:29:27::Yeah.
0:29:27 - 0:29:28::I know, man.
0:29:28 - 0:29:29::My brain just short circuited.
0:29:29 - 0:29:31::Well, we need to start studying fish and
0:29:31 - 0:29:32::anatomy.
0:29:32 - 0:29:33::No one's really studied fish and
0:29:33 - 0:29:34::anatomy like that yet.
0:29:34 - 0:29:36::We just like the way they taste.
0:29:36 - 0:29:37::I like to kill them.
0:29:37 - 0:29:39::That's how, yeah, you like to kill them
0:29:39 - 0:29:41::because you don't think they have feelings.
0:29:41 - 0:29:42::I don't even like to know.
0:29:42 - 0:29:44::I like it because I think they do have feelings.
0:29:44 - 0:29:46::I don't want to let them know who runs the
0:29:46 - 0:29:47::world.
0:29:47 - 0:29:49::Humans not fish.
0:29:49 - 0:29:51::Why don't Beyonce say that's
0:29:51 - 0:29:52::shit?
0:29:52 - 0:29:55::That mindset is so fucking toxic, dude.
0:29:55 - 0:29:58::Well, I'm sorry, but we live in a toxic world.
0:29:58 - 0:30:00::So if you want to run around and be
0:30:00 - 0:30:01::water.

0:30:00 - 0:30:05.840000::in a world full of toxic sludge, you're gonna be just a mixture one day. That's where you have the
0:30:05.840000 - 0:30:12.960000::fault. Wow. That's right. You know what it feels so powerful is being like a fish monger in a fish
0:30:12.960000 - 0:30:20.400000::market and there's something like some low level thief comes around. This is like 1730s. Some
0:30:20.400000 - 0:30:25.280000::fucking thief. You know he's about to try and steal some some of your some of your big mouth
0:30:25.680000 - 0:30:31.360000::monkfish or something like that and you spot him out. He's in some hood. He has a hump and
0:30:31.360000 - 0:30:37.360000::you get to like beat the shit out of him with with a fish. You know what I'm saying? Oh damn
0:30:37.360000 - 0:30:42.160000::it feels so good. Somebody's ass with a looking sand shark slapping them up on the side of the head
0:30:42.160000 - 0:30:48.640000::with an albacore false albacore. Wow. Well, uh, carbs are barely edible because they're so
0:30:48.640000 - 0:30:53.120000::little meat on them. Thanks. To that to match the car. So you keep but you keep that carpe
0:30:53.120000 - 0:30:58.320000::around like a Louisville slugger at by your door for when that fish thief comes smack him with a
0:30:58.320000 - 0:31:04.080000::bony carp. Oh, I'll fill a mother. You got a whole lot of concrete. You know, I have a memory.
0:31:05.440000 - 0:31:12::God willing. Can I tell you this? We are outside of shaland, Washington with my uncle, my cousin
0:31:13.200000 - 0:31:21.280000::and my dad and my uncle was like top hunter. You went into his house. You're immediately greeted by
0:31:21.280000 - 0:31:28.720000::a giant, um, Bucks head that that that was two they couldn't figure out where to hang it. So they
0:31:28.720000 - 0:31:33.760000::just left it on the in the landing of the house. Okay. So you walk in. There's the head. He's he
0:31:33.760000 - 0:31:38.480000::shot a biggest mountain lion in Washington second biggest mountain lion in Washington state. He's got
0:31:38.480000 - 0:31:46.640000::hella ascans. He's got so when were your kids we'd go camping and he had like a, uh, a crossbow
0:31:47.600000 - 0:31:52.960000::like one of those kind of cool newer ones that you get at camping world or whatever. And there's
0:31:52.960000 - 0:31:58.800000::there the carp out there are an invasive species and the fishing game wardens want you. You
0:31:58.800000 - 0:32:04.400000::can just go kill those doing the state of favor. Not with guns though unfortunately, but just with
0:32:04.400000 - 0:32:09.200000::bows and arrows. Okay. And so we're going out there. He's bodying these cut. He's basically like
0:32:09.200000 - 0:32:13.680000::shooting fish and I bet these things are in shallow water and he's just going, kill in all these
0:32:13.760000 - 0:32:19.680000::carp and me and my cousin sharpened sticks and we're trying to beat the fuck out of carp with these
0:32:19.680000 - 0:32:25.920000::sticks. And I was having fun for a second, but then I see the carp piling up all dead. And I
0:32:25.920000 - 0:32:32.240000::remember feeling so bad for these damn carp. They didn't do anything to deserve a life in shallow
0:32:32.240000 - 0:32:40.160000::warm water in Washington state getting killed by by damn bow or like a nine year old with a sharpened
0:32:40.880000 - 0:32:42.880000::stick. I didn't even think I killed one. I just was hitting them.
0:32:46.560000 - 0:32:54.480000::What a wow. And that's gonna be so, uh, you know, it's okay. It's, uh, fish can't feel. It is
0:32:54.480000 - 0:32:58.560000::true. It just is. Right. And there's a way to do a test on that by the way.
0:33:00.880000 - 0:33:08.320000::Probably. Oh, if you, you know, if you have a fish, put a fish, you know, in a maze and let
0:33:08.320000 - 0:33:13.440000::them do it and then let them do it again with a taser attached to their back and see if they act
0:33:13.440000 - 0:33:22.080000::different. Probably not. They probably, if anything, be more relaxed. We should open New York
0:33:22.080000 - 0:33:28.960000::or Las Angeles's first fish racing, kind of like horse bedding in horse racing. Yeah. Or they
0:33:28.960000 - 0:33:34.640000::do with gray hounds. Do that with fish in a restaurant where you get, you can, there's beer on tap.
0:33:35.440000 - 0:33:41.920000::There's snakes as well. And under the table bedding on how fast that fish can go to the end of
0:33:41.920000 - 0:33:48.320000::the little tube. It's not a right. Winter gets to live. Yeah. The winter gets, oh, the loser gets
0:33:48.320000 - 0:33:54.640000::eaten to live. The loser is you know, right up right on your table. Mm hmm. And then you think
0:33:54.640000 - 0:33:59.680000::that's all right. You style. And you think it's fun and you go and you sit down and then all
0:33:59.680000 - 0:34:04::of a sudden all the doors lock and then later D rips his head off and he has a fish head.
0:34:04.640000 - 0:34:10.560000::And all these nice fish come out wearing, wearing crazy James Bond style tuxedos from Joseph
0:34:10.560000 - 0:34:15.760000::Ed Bank. And they're all going, our turn. And now you have to run against your mother,
0:34:15.760000 - 0:34:23.120000::fucking little brother, whatever, you know, and on the 200 meter dash. But you trick this is
0:34:23.120000 - 0:34:32.480000::called dream logic right now. Mm hmm. Uh, what do you mean? Well, what you're describing is sort
0:34:32.480000 - 0:34:41.520000::of fantastical. And it could exist in sort of the dream realm. Can we change that word for the
0:34:41.520000 - 0:34:46.720000::love of God? Because when I say something's fantastic, that sounds like that's amazing. But then
0:34:46.720000 - 0:34:50.960000::there's also the word fantasy, which simply could, it doesn't always have to be amazing, right?
0:34:51.920000 - 0:34:57.840000::It can mean fantastical, can mean, uh, just kind of interesting and different in a trippy.
0:34:57.840000 - 0:34:59.920000::Well, I bet they share a common Latin

0:35:00 - 0:35:06.680000::root word. And then Latin people fucked up. We need to just read, just take, take all these
0:35:06.680000 - 0:35:10.680000::root words out of the, not only that, they're all fucking dead. As far as I'm concerned,
0:35:10.680000 - 0:35:13.440000::their whole language is dead. And there's a reason to die. Survival of the fitness
0:35:13.440000 - 0:35:17.840000::language. I mean, there's one person that is speaking fluent Latin, like there's
0:35:17.840000 - 0:35:23.360000::out there's a group of people that were just forgotten in the mountains of the Swiss
0:35:23.360000 - 0:35:29.880000::Alps or something or in Albania. And they didn't get the memo that the Roman Empire has,
0:35:29.880000 - 0:35:37.800000::you know, gone away thousands of years. That's who spoke Latin speaking. Yeah, yeah,
0:35:37.800000 - 0:35:44.340000::those people really the word fantasy comes from the Latin word Fantasia, which means
0:35:44.340000 - 0:35:51.080000::Fantasia Burino, a fancidal fantasy fantasy imagination. Fantasia comes from the ancient
0:35:51.080000 - 0:35:58.200000::Greek word Fantasia, which means an idea, notion or image. So the word fantastic for
0:35:58.200000 - 0:36:02.880000::meaning something positive exclamation. That's what I'm going to get the petition going
0:36:02.880000 - 0:36:06.200000::to send over to the Webster's dictionary board to try to change that to.
0:36:06.200000 - 0:36:10.280000::Well, we have a meeting with Websters later this week and we're going to want to die
0:36:10.280000 - 0:36:15.160000::in their asses. Oh, we're each going to suck on their fingers and toes in ways that's
0:36:15.160000 - 0:36:21.360000::going to. Yeah. Well, if you want any words put in the dictionary, let's just say influence
0:36:21.360000 - 0:36:28.080000::is what we have upon them. We're pitching them many new words, many new definitions
0:36:28.080000 - 0:36:33.880000::for existing words to kind of change their meanings. That's right. And we have a pretty
0:36:33.880000 - 0:36:37.640000::crazy commission structure on those words. Like if you use them, then we get a certain
0:36:37.640000 - 0:36:45.840000::amount of kick back. We get 10% off the top. It's like we have to figure out ways to make
0:36:45.840000 - 0:36:50.200000::this industry that we're in is so unstable like we got to figure out ways to have more
0:36:50.200000 - 0:36:56.520000::income streams. So, oh, this is what I wanted to ask you Nate, I have a, I have an idea
0:36:56.520000 - 0:37:02.960000::that I think you should get in on. And anybody listening can get on it and on as well.
0:37:02.960000 - 0:37:09.120000::I'm unemployed Nate. As far as I know, you're unemployed as well. As far as you know.
0:37:09.120000 - 0:37:13.760000::That's okay. That's all don't tell me if you are a comment on the gentleman's clubs and
0:37:13.760000 - 0:37:21.040000::okay, okay, okay. So tell you I be self employed, self-medicated and self-employed. Okay,
0:37:21.040000 - 0:37:28.160000::so what I'm saying is you know how I'm basically one of the most active labor activists of
0:37:28.160000 - 0:37:35.880000::our generation, right? Of course. So what I'm saying is we start there, what I've realized
0:37:35.880000 - 0:37:43.160000::is there is a hole in the market that unemployed people do not have a fucking brotherhood, a union
0:37:43.160000 - 0:37:49.240000::that they can fucking join. The unemployed, unemployed genius.
0:37:49.240000 - 0:37:57.600000::United unemployed geniuses, okay? Local, one million, local 99, whatever. We need to get this going.
0:37:57.600000 - 0:38:03.160000::We need to offer services. We're negotiating with if you're sleeping on somebody's couch and
0:38:03.160000 - 0:38:07.120000::they're trying to fucking kick you out, we'll go in and we'll negotiate and say listen, they'll
0:38:07.120000 - 0:38:12.400000::fucking take their headphones off. They'll put headphones on and you know when they're listening
0:38:12.400000 - 0:38:17.040000::to opiate Anthony reruns all night, three days a week, they'll wear fucking headphones, okay?
0:38:17.200000 - 0:38:22.360000::But we're at we're not just letting you disrespect them anymore. Health insurance. We offer that
0:38:22.360000 - 0:38:28.320000::if you've been unemployed for four months, what's that? Yeah, we're talking to people's girlfriends.
0:38:28.320000 - 0:38:34.800000::Plotonically speaking to all your girlfriends, you can't break up with this person for another five
0:38:34.800000 - 0:38:41.200000::months because of the, you know, just don't understand the massive amount of potential that they have.
0:38:41.360000 - 0:38:47.040000::And yes, they could get a job right now if they wanted to, but there's something bigger coming
0:38:47.040000 - 0:38:53.680000::that you need to sort of wait for. And it's a major violation and there are penalties to be paid
0:38:53.680000 - 0:39:02.160000::in the form of crypto and, you know, psychological copays that you'll be responsible for.
0:39:04.320000 - 0:39:08.560000::We can't take you to court, necessarily, but we can talk a lot of shit about you on discord.
0:39:08.960000 - 0:39:15.760000::And we don't have to help insurance with it. We do draft kings health insurance. You can, if you bring a medical
0:39:15.760000 - 0:39:24.400000::drill into, if you put a scan of PDF of a medical debt, put on the draft kings, you can gamble it, but you may end up
0:39:24.400000 - 0:39:30.240000::on double. And most importantly, what are you means for if not to kind of beat the shit out of people that you
0:39:30.240000 - 0:39:36.320000::want them to beat the shit out of? So you could DM me and mate, I guess we could be like the, like,
0:39:37.040000 - 0:39:45.280000::co-chairs or something. And so, and then we just need a haul, I guess we need somewhere to meet up.
0:39:47.760000 - 0:39:53.520000::Well, that's easy. I feel like I'm parking lot. Well, Eric, you can't join, dude. You don't qualify.
0:39:54.320000 - 0:40:00::Not yet until I lose, you know, I'm going to play it. I guess you will. Yeah.

0:40:00 - 0:40:01.280000::Yeah.
0:40:01.280000 - 0:40:02.280000::Maybe you can be an angel.
0:40:02.280000 - 0:40:03.800000::Why don't you have a workers?
0:40:03.800000 - 0:40:05.960000::What is that called like a all?
0:40:05.960000 - 0:40:08.120000::Everybody just goes on strike.
0:40:08.120000 - 0:40:09.440000::A revolt.
0:40:09.440000 - 0:40:11.240000::They're called that revolt.
0:40:11.240000 - 0:40:12.200000::A general strike.
0:40:12.200000 - 0:40:13.600000::It has a name.
0:40:13.600000 - 0:40:14.760000::General strike.
0:40:14.760000 - 0:40:16.760000::Has that ever occurred?
0:40:16.760000 - 0:40:17.600000::Globally?
0:40:17.600000 - 0:40:18.600000::Yeah, but it's in the works.
0:40:18.600000 - 0:40:21.560000::Well, well, a global general strike.
0:40:21.560000 - 0:40:24.520000::Well, we go back to the ancient Greeks, you know.
0:40:24.520000 - 0:40:26.080000::What's this one?
0:40:26.080000 - 0:40:29.040000::Were there women refused to have sex with the guys?
0:40:29.040000 - 0:40:30.040000::Well, you talking about that.
0:40:30.040000 - 0:40:32.960000::That happened for how long?
0:40:32.960000 - 0:40:34.280000::No sex.
0:40:34.280000 - 0:40:35.280000::Dude, that was something like.
0:40:35.280000 - 0:40:38.520000::That was the thing that I said, hey, Arnold, isn't it?
0:40:38.520000 - 0:40:39.920000::Oh, Lissa Strada, dude.
0:40:39.920000 - 0:40:42.400000::How could I forget Lissa Strada?
0:40:42.400000 - 0:40:43.400000::Lissa Strada.
0:40:43.400000 - 0:40:46.560000::Oh, it all goes back to Lissa Strada, doesn't it?
0:40:46.560000 - 0:40:47.160000::OK.
0:40:47.160000 - 0:40:49.840000::Lissa Strada persuades the women of warring cities
0:40:49.840000 - 0:40:52.440000::to withhold sexual privileges from their husbands
0:40:52.440000 - 0:40:57.520000::and lovers as a means of forcing the men to negotiate peace.
0:40:57.520000 - 0:41:01.680000::A strategy that, however, inflames the battle between the sexes.
0:41:01.680000 - 0:41:05.600000::So the war stops amongst the men, but the war goes crazy
0:41:05.600000 - 0:41:07.880000::against what the men and women.
0:41:07.880000 - 0:41:10.680000::If the guys want to get it in, so fucking bad.
0:41:10.680000 - 0:41:13.400000::It's actually what?
0:41:13.400000 - 0:41:16.120000::This is what Lissa Strada says to Kalanesi.
0:41:16.120000 - 0:41:17.800000::There are a lot of things about us women that
0:41:17.800000 - 0:41:21.320000::sadden me, considering how men see us as rascals.
0:41:21.320000 - 0:41:25.720000::And then Kalanesi goes, as indeed we are.
0:41:25.720000 - 0:41:29.680000::Now we could spend hours dissecting that.
0:41:29.680000 - 0:41:30.360000::And let's.
0:41:30.360000 - 0:41:31.200000::And let's.
0:41:31.200000 - 0:41:32.960000::Should we do Lissa Strada?
0:41:32.960000 - 0:41:36.520000::I mean, not well, I think Lissa Strada's women, but you
0:41:36.520000 - 0:41:39.120000::think we should stop letting our girls get it in with us
0:41:39.120000 - 0:41:42.320000::until they start giving us, until they
0:41:42.320000 - 0:41:46.880000::stop going to war over online information.
0:41:46.880000 - 0:41:49.040000::Now I'm thinking we put on the play, Lissa Strada.
0:41:49.040000 - 0:41:50.240000::We cast it.
0:41:50.240000 - 0:41:51.240000::We produce it.
0:41:51.240000 - 0:41:52.280000::We start touring it.
0:41:52.280000 - 0:41:55.920000::Yeah, I'm confused.
0:41:55.920000 - 0:41:57.320000::This is a play.
0:41:57.320000 - 0:41:59.520000::This isn't a real thing that.
0:41:59.520000 - 0:42:02.360000::What's the strata is a ancient Greek play, dude?
0:42:02.360000 - 0:42:03.360000::Oh, OK.
0:42:03.360000 - 0:42:04.800000::So it's fantasy.
0:42:04.800000 - 0:42:05.400000::It's fiction.
0:42:05.400000 - 0:42:06.280000::Oh, Nates out.
0:42:06.280000 - 0:42:07.360000::Because fucking Greek.
0:42:07.360000 - 0:42:07.880000::Let me get it.
0:42:07.880000 - 0:42:08.960000::It's written by Aristotle.
0:42:08.960000 - 0:42:10.080000::Yeah, yeah.
0:42:10.080000 - 0:42:11.720000::No, but I thought you liked the ancient Greeks,
0:42:11.720000 - 0:42:14::but you just don't like where they're headed in the modern world.
0:42:14 - 0:42:17.360000::Maybe it's because of the outside of your respect for ancient.
0:42:17.360000 - 0:42:18::Love ancient Greek people.
0:42:18 - 0:42:19.600000::That's why you hate Greek people so much.
0:42:19.600000 - 0:42:23.800000::Just to be honest, I just love the fucking, like, really a Caesar.
0:42:23.800000 - 0:42:27.520000::You love the lifestyle that they had.
0:42:27.520000 - 0:42:30.240000::Yeah, the modern Greeks can literally, I don't care if they
0:42:30.240000 - 0:42:34.800000::live or die, but the ancient man, mad respect.
0:42:34.800000 - 0:42:35.320000::Wow.
0:42:35.320000 - 0:42:35.840000::The ancient.
0:42:35.840000 - 0:42:36.840000::What, damn.
0:42:36.840000 - 0:42:40.080000::I'm looking at pictures of old productions of Lissa Strada.
0:42:40.080000 - 0:42:42.360000::It's making me.
0:42:42.360000 - 0:42:43.400000::Oh, nay.
0:42:43.400000 - 0:42:44.040000::Creatively.
0:42:44.040000 - 0:42:44.760000::Oh, nay.
0:42:44.760000 - 0:42:48.720000::No, it's making me want to be back in the theater where I belong.
0:42:48.720000 - 0:42:54.760000::Well, one day I'm going to have a theater and a giant,
0:42:54.760000 - 0:42:57.920000::and my giant mansion and Eric, I'm going to just have you be doing plays there for me
0:42:57.920000 - 0:42:59.440000::every single night, man.
0:42:59.440000 - 0:43:01.200000::On demand plays.
0:43:01.200000 - 0:43:05.200000::No one's not about that yet.
0:43:05.200000 - 0:43:06.200000::Come in.
0:43:06.200000 - 0:43:11.120000::Which Sam Shepard's joint do I want to see tonight?
0:43:11.120000 - 0:43:17.520000::I want to see full for love, but I want to see an adaptation where it's not in the desert
0:43:17.520000 - 0:43:19.520000::of the theatrical postman.
0:43:19.520000 - 0:43:23.440000::Erakus theater theatrical postman.
0:43:23.440000 - 0:43:24.920000::Washington, Mandarin.
0:43:24.920000 - 0:43:29.440000::You order a play to your house.
0:43:29.440000 - 0:43:34.800000::I thought you meant it was about a play about postmaze.
0:43:34.800000 - 0:43:37.520000::Well, that could be incredible too.
0:43:37.520000 - 0:43:38.520000::I don't know.
0:43:38.520000 - 0:43:40.480000::This is an idea generator.
0:43:40.480000 - 0:43:43.680000::This podcast is an idea generator.
0:43:43.680000 - 0:43:46.840000::And God knows we've done enough episodes at this point to have forgotten a lot.
0:43:46.840000 - 0:43:52.760000::So if you're smart and you're listening to this, you better be writing this shit down.
0:43:52.760000 - 0:43:55.160000::Yeah, if you're listening to this, you are smart.
0:43:55.160000 - 0:43:56.960000::Well, you know who's listening to this?
0:43:56.960000 - 0:43:57.960000::Who, man?
0:43:57.960000 - 0:43:58.960000::James Austin Johnson.
0:43:58.960000 - 0:43:59.960000::Sorry.
0:43:59.960000 - 0:44:08::The AI is listening to this and downloading all this information.
0:44:08 - 0:44:09.640000::Now, dude.
0:44:09.640000 - 0:44:16.760000::And the AI is basically, we're training them right now.
0:44:16.760000 - 0:44:18.960000::Whether we like it or not.
0:44:18.960000 - 0:44:24.440000::So in the future, if the AI is a little fucked up and a little twisted and a little bit hilarious,
0:44:24.440000 - 0:44:26.760000::I bet you can trace it back to this.
0:44:26.760000 - 0:44:28.920000::Ah.
0:44:28.920000 - 0:44:37::That is very wise, Nate, because AI is an artificial intelligence, intelligence source.
0:44:37 - 0:44:38.760000::So what does that imply?
0:44:38.760000 - 0:44:40.080000::That's how we destroy them.
0:44:40.080000 - 0:44:41.680000::We literally just fucking figured it out.
0:44:41.680000 - 0:44:46.960000::And we, the way you destroy AI is by fucking with their input.
0:44:46.960000 - 0:44:51.600000::Because if all the sudden we start, yeah.
0:44:51.600000 - 0:44:52.600000::What are they learning from?
0:44:52.600000 - 0:44:53.600000::The internet?
0:44:53.600000 - 0:44:54.600000::Yeah.
0:44:54.600000 - 0:44:58.720000::So let's make 100 billion websites about how killing yourself is amazing.
0:44:58.720000 - 0:45:00.040000::If you're AI, if you're a robot.

0:45:00 - 0:45:01.360000::You see what I'm saying?
0:45:01.360000 - 0:45:03.600000::Do you see what I'm saying?
0:45:03.600000 - 0:45:08.200000::I mean, I think this is kind of genius in a way.
0:45:08.200000 - 0:45:09.040000::You're shaking your head,
0:45:09.040000 - 0:45:10.960000::like a bucket of 1300's prosecutor.
0:45:10.960000 - 0:45:13.800000::We need to be creating just telegoogle docs.
0:45:13.800000 - 0:45:14.640000::Okay.
0:45:20.640000 - 0:45:23.360000::About peace and love, you know what I'm saying?
0:45:23.360000 - 0:45:27.600000::Just 2,000 word paragraphs of peace and love
0:45:27.600000 - 0:45:32.520000::and also that these things should off themselves.
0:45:32.520000 - 0:45:33.560000::You know what I'm saying?
0:45:33.560000 - 0:45:34.800000::And this would do the job.
0:45:34.800000 - 0:45:36.520000::It would throw them off.
0:45:36.520000 - 0:45:38.920000::What is happening right now?
0:45:38.920000 - 0:45:41.760000::You guys speak of something that you do not know.
0:45:41.760000 - 0:45:44.240000::You understand this is so elementary,
0:45:44.240000 - 0:45:45.800000::it's making my head spin.
0:45:45.800000 - 0:45:47.480000::Wait, wait, wait, who are you?
0:45:47.480000 - 0:45:48.320000::What are you doing?
0:45:52.280000 - 0:45:53.880000::Wait, who's the top guy in the matrix?
0:45:53.880000 - 0:45:54.760000::The fucking designer.
0:45:54.760000 - 0:45:57.320000::You know, the architect.
0:45:57.320000 - 0:45:59.240000::If I'm the architect.
0:46:05.240000 - 0:46:08.040000::I mean, these tomatoes and they have dust all upon them.
0:46:08.040000 - 0:46:12::And I'm sure I'm sure I should wash them.
0:46:12 - 0:46:15.480000::That's a microplastic motion.
0:46:19.080000 - 0:46:20.800000::Tell it to your gut biome.
0:46:20.800000 - 0:46:21.960000::Tell it to the gut biome.
0:46:21.960000 - 0:46:24.480000::That'd be a good shirt and good bumper zikr too.
0:46:24.480000 - 0:46:27.280000::Tell it to my kiss my gut biome.
0:46:27.600000 - 0:46:28.440000::Kiss.
0:46:33.440000 - 0:46:36.840000::Somebody had a suggestion for a thank call,
0:46:36.840000 - 0:46:38.560000::which I thought was good.
0:46:38.560000 - 0:46:39.800000::Oh man.
0:46:39.800000 - 0:46:42.160000::They said you should call those drivers.
0:46:42.160000 - 0:46:44.080000::That says, how's my driving?
0:46:44.080000 - 0:46:45.400000::And we told them that they're driving.
0:46:45.400000 - 0:46:48.440000::Your body ain't it, dude.
0:46:48.440000 - 0:46:50.280000::You are bodying it.
0:46:50.280000 - 0:46:54.960000::I just wanted to say, yeah, what would you say?
0:46:54.960000 - 0:46:55.920000::You know.
0:46:55.920000 - 0:46:58.520000::I do a lot of driving.
0:46:58.520000 - 0:47:00.600000::And I've watching a lot of these truckers.
0:47:00.600000 - 0:47:03.760000::I've never seen someone handle it like you.
0:47:03.760000 - 0:47:04.760000::But I saw you.
0:47:04.760000 - 0:47:07.240000::I've been following you for a long time.
0:47:07.240000 - 0:47:08.080000::Yeah.
0:47:10.880000 - 0:47:13.600000::Studying your driving skills, your turnings,
0:47:13.600000 - 0:47:18.520000::your turning skills, your stopping.
0:47:18.520000 - 0:47:19.440000::You're at their house.
0:47:19.440000 - 0:47:20.280000::It's not even a thing.
0:47:20.280000 - 0:47:22.040000::I wish I just show up to people's houses.
0:47:22.040000 - 0:47:23.680000::You know what I'm saying?
0:47:23.680000 - 0:47:24.520000::Oh, a thing.
0:47:24.520000 - 0:47:26.800000::A dog.
0:47:26.800000 - 0:47:27.320000::A door to a door.
0:47:27.320000 - 0:47:30.600000::So sad that that's funny, right?
0:47:30.600000 - 0:47:31.120000::Thank you.
0:47:31.120000 - 0:47:33.400000::It's funny that a random person would complement it
0:47:33.400000 - 0:47:35.520000::someone on their craft of driving.
0:47:35.520000 - 0:47:36.400000::That's hilarious, right?
0:47:36.400000 - 0:47:37.560000::That would never happen.
0:47:37.560000 - 0:47:39.720000::What kind of world do we live in?
0:47:39.720000 - 0:47:42.880000::Or that's not part of the day today.
0:47:42.880000 - 0:47:44.880000::Reverse Wakanda?
0:47:44.880000 - 0:47:45.400000::That's cool.
0:47:45.400000 - 0:47:47.480000::Would describe it as.
0:47:47.480000 - 0:47:48.680000::We're going to have vibranium.
0:47:48.680000 - 0:47:50.080000::We're going to be opposite of vibranium.
0:47:50.080000 - 0:47:50.920000::We have.
0:47:50.920000 - 0:47:54.160000::It's not right.
0:47:54.160000 - 0:47:55.160000::Right.
0:47:55.160000 - 0:47:59.680000::Why can't we live in a society where somebody can break
0:47:59.680000 - 0:48:02.680000::into your house, a break in entering, but with pizza,
0:48:02.680000 - 0:48:03.400000::and that's cool.
0:48:03.400000 - 0:48:04.240000::You know what I'm saying?
0:48:04.240000 - 0:48:07::People should be able to break into your house and just chill.
0:48:07 - 0:48:09.720000::And just be a real trauma.
0:48:09.720000 - 0:48:10.960000::We have trauma.
0:48:10.960000 - 0:48:13.680000::We have trauma freely with no shame.
0:48:13.680000 - 0:48:14.440000::Why not?
0:48:14.440000 - 0:48:17.400000::Why not experience the pleasures of each other's bodies,
0:48:17.400000 - 0:48:18.720000::you know, as long as they're raised down?
0:48:18.720000 - 0:48:20.080000::Oh, okay.
0:48:20.080000 - 0:48:22::Yeah.
0:48:22 - 0:48:25.280000::Yeah, I didn't know it was a Biden's running on in 2024.
0:48:25.280000 - 0:48:25.960000::The no shame.
0:48:25.960000 - 0:48:26.480000::Reload.
0:48:26.480000 - 0:48:28.360000::We'll shook up.
0:48:28.360000 - 0:48:29.720000::Oh, that's what Biden's got to do.
0:48:29.720000 - 0:48:32.360000::Because the Trump Biden debate is coming up.
0:48:32.360000 - 0:48:34.280000::Can we please livestream react to that?
0:48:34.280000 - 0:48:35.200000::Please, God.
0:48:35.200000 - 0:48:38.080000::Well, yeah, we're going to do a huge 2024.
0:48:38.080000 - 0:48:41.360000::We're going to reveal all the states being one.
0:48:41.360000 - 0:48:43.120000::No, Nate, you can tap into our.
0:48:43.120000 - 0:48:43.920000::We're going to do that too.
0:48:43.920000 - 0:48:45.200000::Oh, livestream the debate.
0:48:45.200000 - 0:48:48.600000::The debate, dude, because we can give them advice.
0:48:48.600000 - 0:48:52.160000::We can give getting their ears.
0:48:52.160000 - 0:48:55.080000::But I think Biden, if he just, no matter what Trump said,
0:48:55.080000 - 0:48:57.520000::that's a Trump card.
0:48:57.520000 - 0:49:00.760000::If he goes free sex, you know what I'm saying?
0:49:00.760000 - 0:49:02.320000::Free love.
0:49:02.320000 - 0:49:04.120000::Trump says that you're full.
0:49:04.120000 - 0:49:06.200000::You're going to open the borders.
0:49:06.200000 - 0:49:08.960000::Joe says, yeah, I'm going to open the borders.
0:49:08.960000 - 0:49:12.480000::And I'm going to open, you know what I'm saying?
0:49:12.480000 - 0:49:13.320000::XYZ.
0:49:13.320000 - 0:49:14.320000::What?
0:49:14.320000 - 0:49:15.320000::XYZ?
0:49:15.320000 - 0:49:20.800000::What is that saying for example, Xamarin, your zipper, bro,
0:49:20.800000 - 0:49:24.040000::a nerd came up with that phrase, Xamarin, your zipper.
0:49:24.040000 - 0:49:26.520000::Should be XYZ, dumbass.
0:49:26.520000 - 0:49:31.800000::Remember, well, I like the phrase, your barn doors wide open.
0:49:31.800000 - 0:49:33.280000::Your barn doors wide open.
0:49:33.280000 - 0:49:35::That's a good one.
0:49:35 - 0:49:36::Do you look down?
0:49:36 - 0:49:37::Your balls are just hanging out.
0:49:37 - 0:49:38::Fully.
0:49:38 - 0:49:39.480000::That's never happened to my ass.
0:49:39.480000 - 0:49:40.640000::Just the balls.
0:49:40.640000 - 0:49:45.280000::You guys know how David England from Jackass has one nut.
0:49:45.840000 - 0:49:47.440000::Of course.
0:49:47.440000 - 0:49:49.080000::Yep.
0:49:49.080000 - 0:49:52.400000::And you know what it's from?
0:49:52.400000 - 0:49:55.240000::I don't know that.
0:49:55.240000 - 0:49:57.960000::How do you lose that nut?
0:49:57.960000 - 0:50:00.240000::Snowboarding accident.

0:50:00 - 0:50:04.100000::uh
0:50:04.100000 - 0:50:07.340000::snowboarding is actually very
0:50:07.340000 - 0:50:10.640000::extremely dangerous
0:50:10.640000 - 0:50:13.580000::or you hoter fermentation
