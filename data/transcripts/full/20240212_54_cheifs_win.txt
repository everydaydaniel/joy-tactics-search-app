0:11:39.880000 - 0:11:43.160000::Do you know who Charlie of the Chocolate Factory is?
0:11:43.160000 - 0:11:44::Yeah.
0:11:48.120000 - 0:11:49.520000::Never mind.
0:11:49.520000 - 0:11:50.280000::All right.
0:11:50.280000 - 0:11:51.120000::Save it for later.
0:11:51.120000 - 0:11:52.160000::Save it for what you're doing.
0:11:52.160000 - 0:11:53::I'm gonna say no.
0:11:53 - 0:11:54::Because I know you're gonna wanna bring out a...
0:11:54 - 0:11:57.520000::Six months from now, I'm gonna slip it into a conversation.
0:11:57.520000 - 0:11:58.680000::It'll be okay.
0:11:58.680000 - 0:11:59.720000::That sneaky.
0:11:59.720000 - 0:12:00.560000::That's how it works.
0:12:00.560000 - 0:12:01.760000::That's something so amazing.
0:12:01.760000 - 0:12:02.760000::Something so...
0:12:02.760000 - 0:12:03.600000::Picking amazing.
0:12:03.600000 - 0:12:04.800000::Was it about food?
0:12:04.800000 - 0:12:05.720000::Was it about...
0:12:05.720000 - 0:12:07.080000::Or was it about, man, dig deep.
0:12:07.080000 - 0:12:07.920000::You crane.
0:12:07.920000 - 0:12:08.760000::I mean, you mean new childhoods.
0:12:08.760000 - 0:12:09.720000::Oh, oh, oh.
0:12:09.720000 - 0:12:12.920000::Here's, Nate, you're saying how you wouldn't be surprised
0:12:12.920000 - 0:12:14.680000::if there's a clone.
0:12:14.680000 - 0:12:18.400000::I think I'm getting up to a point in this life where...
0:12:18.400000 - 0:12:19.520000::I used to be when I was a kid.
0:12:19.520000 - 0:12:20.920000::I was very afraid of Satan.
0:12:20.920000 - 0:12:22.400000::I was very afraid of ghosts.
0:12:22.400000 - 0:12:23.800000::I was afraid of the supernatural
0:12:23.800000 - 0:12:25.920000::or something being a little weird.
0:12:25.920000 - 0:12:27.640000::Then I think even though last few years
0:12:27.640000 - 0:12:32.040000::when the simulation theory came to prominence in the media,
0:12:32.040000 - 0:12:35.280000::I was like, oh, God, this is so disturbing.
0:12:35.280000 - 0:12:39.160000::Recently, I'm kinda like whatever bring it on.
0:12:39.160000 - 0:12:41.200000::A little bit bring it on, I don't care.
0:12:41.200000 - 0:12:42.040000::I was at...
0:12:42.040000 - 0:12:43.640000::I was showering, huh?
0:12:43.640000 - 0:12:44.960000::Not necessarily death.
0:12:44.960000 - 0:12:46.280000::Even that, I'm fine with.
0:12:46.280000 - 0:12:48.860000::But just like, if something really comes in cracks,
0:12:48.860000 - 0:12:51.840000::reality, wide open, I'm ready.
0:12:51.840000 - 0:12:54.080000::I think I'm legit kind of ready because...
0:12:54.080000 - 0:12:55.960000::That's what I'm gonna do tonight.
0:12:55.960000 - 0:12:58::Oh, he's gonna fucking break the dimension,
0:12:58 - 0:12:59.600000::bring it on, like, good.
0:12:59.600000 - 0:13:00.440000::He's gonna bring it on.
0:13:00.440000 - 0:13:01.280000::He's gonna bring it on.
0:13:01.280000 - 0:13:02.120000::He's gonna bring it on.
0:13:03.080000 - 0:13:05.680000::But when I was in Montreal, we were leaving.
0:13:05.680000 - 0:13:07.520000::I was leaving for the airport and I showered
0:13:07.520000 - 0:13:09.720000::and I was a little sleep deprived.
0:13:09.720000 - 0:13:13.360000::And I looked and the door was the spacing between the door
0:13:13.360000 - 0:13:16.520000::of the bathroom was like so small, like less than an inch.
0:13:16.520000 - 0:13:19.120000::And I see something like whew, whisp out,
0:13:19.120000 - 0:13:20.720000::a gray thing whips out.
0:13:20.720000 - 0:13:22.560000::And I was like, must have been a mouse.
0:13:22.560000 - 0:13:24.120000::But then I was thinking that was way too long
0:13:24.120000 - 0:13:25.600000::to be a fucking mouse.
0:13:25.600000 - 0:13:27.560000::Just it was like a gray puff of smoke
0:13:27.560000 - 0:13:29.480000::snake through the thing.
0:13:29.480000 - 0:13:33.720000::And I think maybe it was just some dust or...
0:13:33.720000 - 0:13:35.480000::But if it was supernatural,
0:13:35.480000 - 0:13:37.120000::I just basically accepted it in the moment.
0:13:37.120000 - 0:13:39.920000::I was like, yep, that's all good.
0:13:39.920000 - 0:13:43.640000::I don't need to think that I'm broken mentally.
0:13:43.640000 - 0:13:45.400000::There probably are just things that are fucking crazy.
0:13:45.400000 - 0:13:46.240000::You know why?
0:13:46.240000 - 0:13:47.920000::Because you've been conditioned your entire life
0:13:47.920000 - 0:13:51.920000::to accept the fact that supernatural things are...
0:13:51.920000 - 0:13:53.080000::The reality.
0:13:53.080000 - 0:13:55.440000::You're watching movies, you're watching TV shows
0:13:55.440000 - 0:13:57.800000::with all these supernatural creatures with ghosts,
0:13:57.800000 - 0:13:59.920000::with aliens, with monsters.
0:13:59.920000 - 0:14:02.120000::So yeah, when you see one come in
0:14:02.120000 - 0:14:03.880000::and it does break reality,
0:14:03.880000 - 0:14:06.200000::so we're not all gonna fucking freak out.
0:14:06.200000 - 0:14:07.320000::Yeah, you did your job.
0:14:07.320000 - 0:14:10.240000::Good job, I'm a CIA American government.
0:14:10.240000 - 0:14:11.640000::Good job.
0:14:11.640000 - 0:14:14.400000::Have you seen that video from the 80s of that,
0:14:14.400000 - 0:14:16.480000::this like, news stations interviewing parents
0:14:16.480000 - 0:14:19::that brought their kids to the movie Alien?
0:14:19 - 0:14:20.760000::And they're like, do you think it was appropriate
0:14:20.760000 - 0:14:23.480000::for your son, your young son to watch Alien?
0:14:23.480000 - 0:14:26.840000::Like, is it, and this like, kind of Southern dads like?
0:14:26.840000 - 0:14:28.120000::Well, yeah, I think you should know
0:14:28.120000 - 0:14:29.160000::what's possibly out there
0:14:29.160000 - 0:14:31.040000::and what could be coming for the...
0:14:31.040000 - 0:14:32.880000::For Earth, imminently.
0:14:33.920000 - 0:14:36.200000::He kind of got it, he understood.
0:14:36.200000 - 0:14:38.520000::What about that one where they say,
0:14:38.520000 - 0:14:40::do you think that aliens exist?
0:14:40 - 0:14:42.280000::The man on the street interviews from the 60s?
0:14:42.280000 - 0:14:46::And they go, oh, I don't think about stuff like that.
0:14:46 - 0:14:47.480000::I don't think it's right to,
0:14:47.480000 - 0:14:50::I don't think you should be asking questions like that.
0:14:51 - 0:14:53.280000::That's how things should be.
0:14:53.280000 - 0:14:54.120000::That's how things should be.
0:14:54.120000 - 0:14:56.240000::This is it, or it's that because the body snatchers,
0:14:56.240000 - 0:14:59.240000::some green lizard already went up in their whole body
0:14:59.240000 - 0:15:00.080000::and took them over.

0:15:00 - 0:15:02.800000::We might be taking over already, man.
0:15:04.400000 - 0:15:06.480000::You know what I want to know so badly.
0:15:07.160000 - 0:15:08.320000::What? What's that?
0:15:09.240000 - 0:15:14.640000::Is because every every one of these like alien people that knows something.
0:15:14.800000 - 0:15:21.140000::Yeah. They're all like, like all of them are like, I know something that will
0:15:21.140000 - 0:15:23.520000::shake you to the core. You know what I'm saying? Right.
0:15:23.520000 - 0:15:26.960000::They're always holding something. They're always with holding like this crazy.
0:15:27.040000 - 0:15:30.760000::Like, oh, they they briefed the so and so on this.
0:15:30.760000 - 0:15:35.800000::And afterwards they were fucking it couldn't even like, like just they couldn't
0:15:35.800000 - 0:15:38.600000::even sleep for four months after that.
0:15:38.960000 - 0:15:42.080000::And I want to know what the hell scary could it be?
0:15:42.120000 - 0:15:44::Is the whole world about to explode?
0:15:44 - 0:15:47.960000::Oh, what sort of information would right would we live to?
0:15:48.280000 - 0:15:51.400000::We're souls being put. I know we brought this up before, but we're soul.
0:15:51.720000 - 0:15:55.800000::We're higher dimensional souls being punished for some kind of crime being strapped
0:15:55.960000 - 0:15:57.280000::on the prison colony.
0:15:57.280000 - 0:16:00.320000::Or if that he that you know about that right?
0:16:00.480000 - 0:16:01.160000::Of course.
0:16:01.160000 - 0:16:03.440000::I mean, that's the most likely thing that's happening.
0:16:03.480000 - 0:16:05.160000::But even now would be like, all right.
0:16:05.480000 - 0:16:08.280000::Okay. So what? I'm going to go to fucking McDonald's still.
0:16:09.240000 - 0:16:09.520000::Yeah.
0:16:09.520000 - 0:16:12.320000::I just want to make Donald yesterday.
0:16:12.640000 - 0:16:13.800000::Mmm. I'd go back today.
0:16:13.800000 - 0:16:15.200000::Mmm. Damn.
0:16:15.200000 - 0:16:18.400000::That's how easy it is to get stuck back in the prison system like that.
0:16:18.680000 - 0:16:21.160000::You know what I'm saying? There's so many things that can distract you.
0:16:21.160000 - 0:16:22.080000::I'm going to throw you away.
0:16:22.080000 - 0:16:23.080000::He's prison.
0:16:23.720000 - 0:16:26.200000::What if we are one fucking natural complex?
0:16:27.160000 - 0:16:28.200000::Imagine this.
0:16:28.640000 - 0:16:30.480000::Imagine that to begin of all time.
0:16:30.480000 - 0:16:33.440000::There were eight supernatural beings created equally.
0:16:33.960000 - 0:16:36.240000::Eric, you have the biggest boater in your nose right now.
0:16:36.280000 - 0:16:37.080000::Do I really?
0:16:48.760000 - 0:16:50.280000::You like snobbery.
0:16:50.960000 - 0:16:51.680000::Hey people.
0:16:51.680000 - 0:16:52.560000::Hey people. Wait.
0:16:52.560000 - 0:16:53.680000::What is going on?
0:16:53.680000 - 0:16:54.840000::Yeah. This is so worth me.
0:16:54.960000 - 0:16:58.360000::Worth me going into this is just a new theory I came up with.
0:16:58.480000 - 0:17:00.600000::There's eight supernatural beings.
0:17:00.600000 - 0:17:03.120000::So and they're on like the 10th dimension.
0:17:03.120000 - 0:17:07.160000::They're so like powerful and and vast and huge.
0:17:07.160000 - 0:17:08.560000::We can't be going to comprehend them.
0:17:08.560000 - 0:17:09.040000::Why?
0:17:09.040000 - 0:17:13.120000::One of them commits a crime kind of like Eve eating the apple and eating.
0:17:13.680000 - 0:17:18::And the other seven punish that one being to experience life on all the other
0:17:18 - 0:17:18.600000::dimensions,
0:17:18.680000 - 0:17:21.920000::nine to mention, eighth dimension, seventh dimension, all the way down to the
0:17:22.160000 - 0:17:23.320000::2D, one D dimensions.
0:17:23.800000 - 0:17:28.600000::What if we are the third dimension prison right now and all of our consciousness,
0:17:28.720000 - 0:17:34.480000::every living being in our universe is that one being but all shattered into a million different creatures.
0:17:35.120000 - 0:17:37.360000::And our goal is to reunite the entire consciousness.
0:17:37.360000 - 0:17:37.800000::And our goal.
0:17:37.800000 - 0:17:41.520000::Yeah, if we can figure out how to come together as one in peace, no more war.
0:17:41.920000 - 0:17:42.520000::No more.
0:17:42.520000 - 0:17:44.200000::We can rejoin the supernatural.
0:17:44.200000 - 0:17:44.440000::No physically.
0:17:44.440000 - 0:17:48.200000::We need to physically fuse every human being in the world together to
0:17:48.200000 - 0:17:49.640000::re configure.
0:17:49.640000 - 0:17:52.840000::You know, like the old magic, the gathering cards where it's like you need five
0:17:52.840000 - 0:17:54.760000::horse to assemble the Yugiyo monster.
0:17:55.120000 - 0:17:56.400000::That's what the beings are.
0:17:56.400000 - 0:18:00.680000::That's why we keep procreating because we need to glue each other together to reform
0:18:00.960000 - 0:18:04.880000::Olin, whatever the fucking eighth guy's name is from outer space.
0:18:04.880000 - 0:18:08.400000::Got you all in the ancient bubbler off of the forbidden stack, whatever.
0:18:08.640000 - 0:18:09.200000::You know what I'm saying?
0:18:09.560000 - 0:18:12.280000::And we eventually we're going to have to fight God.
0:18:12.400000 - 0:18:13.800000::That's what this is all leading to.
0:18:13.800000 - 0:18:15.880000::Oh, I'm prepared to fight God.
0:18:16.280000 - 0:18:18.080000::I fight God every day with my lyrics.
0:18:18.080000 - 0:18:20.360000::Man, you're going to rip that.
0:18:20.360000 - 0:18:21.200000::That little.
0:18:21.200000 - 0:18:22.200000::We are God.
0:18:22.200000 - 0:18:22.600000::God.
0:18:23.400000 - 0:18:24.280000::Out of your mouth.
0:18:24.600000 - 0:18:25.440000::Good luck, dude.
0:18:25.440000 - 0:18:28.440000::You know how they say you shouldn't say stuff on podcasts.
0:18:28.440000 - 0:18:29.800000::Podcasts are forever.
0:18:30.240000 - 0:18:31.880000::Yeah, you know who's listening to the shit?
0:18:33.120000 - 0:18:34.240000::Imagine listening.
0:18:35 - 0:18:36.480000::God, you think God's listening to this shit?
0:18:37 - 0:18:37.480000::Yeah.
0:18:39.640000 - 0:18:44.200000::Imagine where I'm cast as the new president and household cards in 20 years.
0:18:44.880000 - 0:18:50.520000::And this, this gets pulled up on an interview that I say, I want to fight God and my career.
0:18:52.800000 - 0:18:53.800000::We are God here.
0:18:53.800000 - 0:18:55.600000::Let me just tell us all listeners right now.

0:21:09.860000 - 0:21:14.460000::something you would be duped into purchasing air. I'm surprised you don't have one.

0:21:52.760000 - 0:21:59.960000::Now what is that about your all's personality because this is why I've only ever played three or four video games
0:21:59.960000 - 0:22:05.960000::about life because once I'm set with a task I can't ever admit defeat in any way.

0:22:43.760000 - 0:22:53.160000::That's why I came here that's why I downloaded Elden ring to be a great that's why I'm going to Burger King to finish the meal that's why I buy clothes to wear you know I'm saying.
0:22:53.160000 - 0:23:02.360000::Only great things deserve my undivided attention and when I find out something's not great I put it down and leave it in the dust and get it out of my life.
0:23:02.360000 - 0:23:07.160000::That's why this year I'll put Spider-Man 2.

0:35:15.400000 - 0:35:16.520000::What?
0:35:16.520000 - 0:35:17.360000::Is that what you heard?

0:35:21.760000 - 0:35:23.680000::No, we didn't say that.
0:35:23.680000 - 0:35:26.280000::And some people are saying we're not actually even going on tour.
0:35:26.280000 - 0:35:29.080000::We just have a two month prison sentence for some fines
0:35:29.080000 - 0:35:32.200000::we didn't pay and we're covering for our own.
0:35:32.200000 - 0:35:34.080000::We're going to stay tour going.
0:35:34.080000 - 0:35:35.080000::We are going.
0:35:35.080000 - 0:35:37.520000::We're not just leaving the country for a while.
0:35:37.520000 - 0:35:40.480000::And that is kind of community service, right?
0:35:40.480000 - 0:35:41.480000::Yeah.
0:35:41.480000 - 0:35:44.040000::It is, and I said, I mean, the way people feel after they come
0:35:44.040000 - 0:35:49.240000::and see these shows is sometimes like dangerous because the next day
0:35:49.240000 - 0:35:53.440000::they, this Aratone is so depleted that it's like extreme depression
0:35:53.440000 - 0:35:55.720000::after a night of extreme ecstasy.
0:35:55.720000 - 0:35:59::There's a little sense of it being, it's like an ethical right
0:35:59 - 0:36:03.640000::like, I'm giving you this pleasure, right?
0:36:03.640000 - 0:36:07.280000::And enjoyment that you should only be getting from a loved one.
0:36:07.280000 - 0:36:09.760000::And so I feel there's a question with the ethics of it.
0:36:09.760000 - 0:36:12.920000::Is it okay to fall in love with someone like me on stage?
0:36:12.920000 - 0:36:15.880000::Is it okay to feel those feelings and then go, you know,
0:36:15.880000 - 0:36:20.240000::honestly go back home and look at your partner and say, I love you still.
0:36:21.640000 - 0:36:22.240000::So, right.
0:36:22.240000 - 0:36:26.440000::Well, that's why I'm wearing, that's why lately I've been wearing such bulky clothing
0:36:26.440000 - 0:36:30.480000::on stage because if you could see my figure as well as I'm,
0:36:30.480000 - 0:36:32.920000::I'm being funny, I'm being charming.
0:36:32.920000 - 0:36:36.240000::If you could see my body too, it would be just like three strikes,
0:36:36.240000 - 0:36:38.320000::fucking these people would fall in love with me immediately.
0:36:38.320000 - 0:36:39.840000::So I'm trying to hide my shape.
0:36:39.840000 - 0:36:41.680000::All people show the last shows.
0:36:41.680000 - 0:36:42.680000::Yeah.
0:36:43.960000 - 0:36:44.720000::Yeah.
0:36:44.720000 - 0:36:49.640000::But I do think the full like Dick Tracy outfit is like distracting
0:36:49.640000 - 0:36:51.440000::in a way like the trench coat.
0:36:51.440000 - 0:36:53.960000::Well, man, if you have another idea like.
0:36:53.960000 - 0:37:00.160000::Come on stage in the full like trench like sweating so bad.
0:37:00.160000 - 0:37:07.440000::I did someone did take a video of me the other night and I was wearing a light color,
0:37:07.440000 - 0:37:11.680000::you know, sure where you could see sweat and I lifted up my arm and yeah,
0:37:11.680000 - 0:37:14.400000::you could see the sweat staying and there's almost nothing worse than that.
0:37:14.400000 - 0:37:16.800000::Human sweat, man, except for some whoever see.
0:37:16.800000 - 0:37:17.800000::Human sweat.
0:37:17.800000 - 0:37:18.800000::Yeah.
0:37:18.800000 - 0:37:19.800000::Nate, that's nothing to you.

0:37:21.280000 - 0:37:24.040000::I really don't care about that sort of stuff.
0:37:24.040000 - 0:37:25.040000::About initially.
