0:00:31.360000 - 0:00:32.240000::We're all feeling good.
0:00:32.240000 - 0:00:33.440000::We got good sleep.

0:00:37.560000 - 0:00:39.320000::that we wish we could talk about a little more.
0:00:39.320000 - 0:00:39.960000::But we can.
0:00:39.960000 - 0:00:41.880000::We all sign NDAs.
0:00:41.880000 - 0:00:42.880000::So.
0:00:42.880000 - 0:00:44.640000::And I got kidnapped.
0:00:44.640000 - 0:00:49.480000::So that's what's unfortunately somebody just caught me
0:00:49.480000 - 0:00:49.920000::slipping.
0:00:49.920000 - 0:00:51.240000::They put a bag on my head.
0:00:51.240000 - 0:00:52.440000::Oh no.
0:00:52.440000 - 0:00:52.920000::Here I am.
0:00:52.920000 - 0:00:54.440000::But yeah.
0:00:54.440000 - 0:01:00.280000::I was in a sort of basement with a bunch of kind of insulation.
0:01:00.280000 - 0:01:05.880000::It looks like most of the frame is just kind of like insulation
0:01:05.880000 - 0:01:10.320000::that might need like redone or something.
0:01:10.320000 - 0:01:14.200000::I'm probably breathing in something a little funky right now.
0:01:14.200000 - 0:01:16.800000::If you got kidnapped, I would be so pissed.
0:01:16.800000 - 0:01:18.080000::I would ever kidnapped you.
0:01:18.080000 - 0:01:20.200000::Well, I'm an adult.
0:01:20.200000 - 0:01:21.680000::So that would just be a texture.
0:01:21.680000 - 0:01:23.280000::I would not be scared at all.
0:01:23.280000 - 0:01:25.120000::I know you would get out of that situation.
0:01:25.120000 - 0:01:28.080000::Oh, you would find me or eventually you would fucking roll
0:01:28.080000 - 0:01:31.760000::up to Somalia with all the guns, but blazing you and Eric,
0:01:31.760000 - 0:01:32.920000::who are you?
0:01:32.920000 - 0:01:35.160000::Just completely DIY vigilante.
0:01:35.160000 - 0:01:36.600000::And you'd fucking bust in the castle.
0:01:36.600000 - 0:01:40.960000::You'd see me fucking fully have become the king of Somalia.
0:01:40.960000 - 0:01:41.800000::Oh, what?
0:01:41.800000 - 0:01:42.600000::Jack, what the hell?
0:01:42.600000 - 0:01:43.360000::Sorry, y'all.
0:01:43.360000 - 0:01:44.120000::I don't want to go back.
0:01:44.120000 - 0:01:45.840000::The Joy Tactics movie.
0:01:45.840000 - 0:01:48::The Joy Tactics movie.
0:01:48 - 0:01:51.360000::We have to go save them to do one final podcast.
0:01:51.360000 - 0:01:52.680000::And you know what we should do?
0:01:52.680000 - 0:01:54.320000::Hey, this has never been done.
0:01:54.320000 - 0:01:55.040000::What?
0:01:55.040000 - 0:01:58.520000::We should steal the first couple scenes of the hangover.
0:01:58.520000 - 0:02:01.840000::Like not shop for shop, but like the exact same scenes
0:02:01.840000 - 0:02:04.360000::and like pretty similar as like, as similar locations.
0:02:04.360000 - 0:02:08::Not shop for shop, but the exact, basically the exact same locations.
0:02:08 - 0:02:12.920000::But like the same lines, just pretty much the same lines.
0:02:12.920000 - 0:02:18.560000::Maybe a little different, but in like lower budget, obviously.
0:02:18.560000 - 0:02:21.760000::So people cover music.
0:02:21.760000 - 0:02:22.640000::People cover songs.
0:02:22.640000 - 0:02:25.040000::Every song is a cover of another song.
0:02:25.040000 - 0:02:28.960000::Yeah, why can't we cover a film, you know?
0:02:28.960000 - 0:02:32.840000::Every film is an homage of a film, which is an homage of a book,
0:02:32.840000 - 0:02:36.280000::which is an homage of a limbic, where it all started.
0:02:36.280000 - 0:02:37.360000::Yep.
0:02:37.360000 - 0:02:38.360000::That's correct.
0:02:38.360000 - 0:02:40.480000::And so we pause for one sec, because I need to figure out
0:02:40.480000 - 0:02:42.080000::how to lower the volume on my headphones.
0:02:42.080000 - 0:02:43::I'm afraid of leaking it.
0:02:43 - 0:02:43.760000::I don't want to.
0:02:43.760000 - 0:02:47.760000::So this is a part of the podcast that we like to call the three
0:02:47.760000 - 0:02:53.400000::minutes in Eric Tech Problem, which has consistently over the last 20
0:02:53.400000 - 0:02:54.920000::or 30 episodes.
0:02:54.920000 - 0:02:55.920000::Oh god.
0:02:55.920000 - 0:02:57.240000::No, it's a fun spit.
0:02:57.240000 - 0:02:58::It's like a segment.
0:02:58 - 0:03:05.720000::It's like, you know, top 10 letterman has, you know, top 10.
0:03:05.720000 - 0:03:06.800000::Oh, wait, I got it.
0:03:06.800000 - 0:03:07.720000::I literally have.
0:03:07.720000 - 0:03:08.560000::Thank you notes.
0:03:08.560000 - 0:03:12.720000::And we just have the dumbest third member technologically.
0:03:12.720000 - 0:03:16.400000::No, I know listen to the problems with Eric Ray.
0:03:16.400000 - 0:03:18.400000::You guys were making fun of me.
0:03:18.400000 - 0:03:19.400000::Literally.
0:03:19.400000 - 0:03:21.360000::I figured it out so quickly.
0:03:21.360000 - 0:03:22.520000::Y'all know what's wrong?
0:03:22.520000 - 0:03:24::My headphones is too loud.
0:03:24 - 0:03:28.320000::I can't figure out what button is all for the turn of them down.
0:03:28.320000 - 0:03:29.800000::Can we make a pause for a second?
0:03:29.800000 - 0:03:32.120000::My headphones are too loud.
0:03:32.120000 - 0:03:33.360000::That's what you said.
0:03:33.360000 - 0:03:34.040000::Are we good?
0:03:34.040000 - 0:03:34.560000::Are we good?
0:03:34.560000 - 0:03:35.400000::We're good now.
0:03:35.400000 - 0:03:35.920000::We're good.
0:03:35.920000 - 0:03:37.320000::I figured out how to lower them.
0:03:37.320000 - 0:03:38.320000::OK.
0:03:38.320000 - 0:03:39.120000::That was fun.
0:03:39.120000 - 0:03:40.840000::That segment always gets me going.
0:03:40.840000 - 0:03:43.920000::But this is the, I mean, OK, let's.
0:03:43.920000 - 0:03:45.800000::So that's a good segment.
0:03:45.800000 - 0:03:47.400000::Yeah, this is a good segue into, we
0:03:47.400000 - 0:03:50.320000::want to talk about alter egos today.
0:03:50.320000 - 0:03:55.200000::Alter alternate personas, kind of the masks that we put on.
0:03:55.200000 - 0:04:00.880000::And right now, right there, you just saw Jack and I put on an alternate
0:04:00.880000 - 0:04:05.720000::ego persona of being bullies, which we are not ever,
0:04:05.720000 - 0:04:07.560000::we're ever like that in real life.
0:04:07.560000 - 0:04:08.080000::Never.
0:04:08.080000 - 0:04:09.120000::We are not bullies.
0:04:09.120000 - 0:04:10.280000::We are never like that.
0:04:10.280000 - 0:04:13.040000::We would never be mean to any one in the world.
0:04:13.040000 - 0:04:13.720000::Never.
0:04:13.720000 - 0:04:17.920000::Nobody bullies like, not me.
0:04:17.920000 - 0:04:20.640000::Well, what you saw of Eric, which was really a cool take,
0:04:20.640000 - 0:04:23.560000::and what is unique out of the box thinking of Professor
0:04:23.560000 - 0:04:28.320000::Ray Hill per usual, is that his alter ego is actually
0:04:28.320000 - 0:04:31.800000::dumber and less capable than his actual self.
0:04:31.800000 - 0:04:35.440000::A lot of alter egos are like, I'm Superman.
0:04:35.440000 - 0:04:37.960000::Ziggy star does whatever it is.
0:04:37.960000 - 0:04:40.400000::Eric's like, you know, I'm about to sink into somebody
0:04:40.400000 - 0:04:42.960000::who can't do anything.
0:04:42.960000 - 0:04:43.800000::Oh, shit.
0:04:43.800000 - 0:04:46.240000::There goes Eric, Ray Hill.
0:04:46.240000 - 0:04:47.080000::That's right.
0:04:47.080000 - 0:04:49.560000::Well, I think it's actually a power move because when you give
0:04:49.560000 - 0:04:53.680000::yourself on the surface less intelligence, but under the surface,
0:04:53.680000 - 0:04:56.200000::you know, actually exactly what's going on.
0:04:56.200000 - 0:04:58.560000::You get to manipulate people in ways.
0:04:58.560000 - 0:05:00.080000::It's what Sasha Baron Cohen did with the

0:05:00 - 0:05:03.200000::Borat. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, you're talking about the gestures, essentially.
0:05:03.200000 - 0:05:07.640000::The gestures? I was just a gesture for you guys and you fell into my trap and I exposed
0:05:07.640000 - 0:05:14.960000::you for essentially the cruel people that you, your alter egos at least are. Yeah. And
0:05:14.960000 - 0:05:19.840000::you know, if we want we can edit it out and people won't be mad at you in six years when
0:05:19.840000 - 0:05:27::you're on SNL2 or whatever when that comes out. No, I want to pay for everything I've
0:05:27 - 0:05:34.560000::done. That's what I'm saying. No, but, but we, as human beings, we wear many alter egos.
0:05:34.560000 - 0:05:39.880000::I wear an alter ego when I talk to my relatives, you know, I wear an alter ego when I go to the
0:05:39.880000 - 0:05:44.680000::gym. I wear alternatives. Alternative egos everywhere. Well, Eric, are you confusing
0:05:44.680000 - 0:05:53.400000::alter ego with just kind of what, you know, like, we're kind of composure or like, no, no,
0:05:53.400000 - 0:05:58.120000::no, because I mean, I give different names to everyone. This is Lonnie. Hello. So here,
0:05:58.120000 - 0:06:05.920000::literally, Lonnie at the gym, you do Lonnie is that Lonnie is at the gym. So I get this
0:06:05.920000 - 0:06:11.960000::squat rack and the fucking area around it. Every new person you want to get the dead ghost.
0:06:11.960000 - 0:06:19.040000::Every new person that you see in public is a chance to kind of test out a new kind of voice,
0:06:19.040000 - 0:06:25.760000::any voice that you can add to your repertoire of voice acting skills, different characters,
0:06:25.760000 - 0:06:30.880000::different accents. Right. It's just the perfect time. So if you're ever trying to work on
0:06:30.880000 - 0:06:36.680000::your, yeah, if you're working on your Cockney or whatever, you know, your German accent,
0:06:36.680000 - 0:06:44.120000::well, when I go to the, sorry, when I went, I'm, because I was born, I don't even know if
0:06:44.120000 - 0:06:48.640000::I want to say this publicly. I'm not going to say what my real name is, but it's not Jack.
0:06:48.640000 - 0:06:52.960000::Then you will not be able to ever figure out what my real name is. My birth name is
0:06:52.960000 - 0:06:56.440000::crazy. And let's just say it's one of the names of the Twilight guys I won't say which
0:06:56.440000 - 0:07:04.080000::one. But when I go to the doctor, they don't know that I go by Jack. And these fools are
0:07:04.080000 - 0:07:10.320000::walking me around calling me, let's just say Jacob. And this is a completely, an opportunity
0:07:10.320000 - 0:07:16.200000::for me to go into the room and reinvent myself, even if it's just like, well, I'm getting
0:07:16.200000 - 0:07:22.880000::my blood drawn. I can go, oh my God, I was working at the candy shop today. I'm so tired.
0:07:22.880000 - 0:07:28.200000::Just something, some different type of guy. Oh my God. I don't know what that is. And I
0:07:28.200000 - 0:07:31.720000::have another story, but I can save it for later in the podcast if people don't want to
0:07:31.720000 - 0:07:40.600000::hear it yet. No, we, you know what? Yeah, let's save it for later. Yeah, no, let's
0:07:40.600000 - 0:07:45.880000::base it out and like literally, like, candy rations. No, no, no, say it now. All right,
0:07:45.880000 - 0:07:50.480000::I'll say it. So here's a really funny. This is once again, the joy of a podcast of Joy
0:07:50.480000 - 0:07:56.840000::Tactics is you get to know us really. And so this is a true fact about me, my, on my birth
0:07:56.840000 - 0:08:04.720000::certificate, it says Aaron, what the fuck? And it was basically a typo. And it had to
0:08:04.720000 - 0:08:10.320000::be amended. And so in eighth grade science class was the first time where they called
0:08:10.320000 - 0:08:16.960000::Aaron Benzinger. And I looked around like, oh, because I was a prankster. And so for this
0:08:16.960000 - 0:08:22.680000::to be given into my lap, this was the sweetest gift that God has ever given me, except for
0:08:22.680000 - 0:08:28.960000::my loved ones, was getting in my biceps was getting to go by Aaron, all making everybody
0:08:28.960000 - 0:08:34.920000::all laugh the whole year. It's Aaron science class with Aaron. And then at the end of
0:08:34.920000 - 0:08:41.120000::the year, I went, excuse me, Mrs. Whatever, just so you know, my name is Aaron. And she
0:08:41.120000 - 0:08:49::wasn't like this. Oh, okay. And then she was impressed. She didn't really give a rat's
0:08:49 - 0:08:54.500000::ass. And she was just at work. It turns out, but and then guys have another story. I
0:08:54.500000 - 0:08:59.980000::don't start. I was getting my new ID and my ID didn't match up to something. So I had
0:08:59.980000 - 0:09:05.160000::to go get a social security card right. And they print out the social security card in
0:09:05.160000 - 0:09:10.340000::a sense. And it says fucking Aaron on it. What the hell? Aaron is, listen, now Aaron's
0:09:10.340000 - 0:09:14.020000::on my fucking driver's license. It's never been my name. And I don't know what my name
0:09:14.020000 - 0:09:18.820000::is anymore. That is your all you could get away with crimes that would make my really
0:09:18.820000 - 0:09:24.420000::people's toes curl, dude. I'll make them. That was Aaron. Like a elf. Can you imagine
0:09:24.420000 - 0:09:29.580000::having a hidden twin and they're not going to manipulate them? No, no, no, no, no, you
0:09:29.580000 - 0:09:33.500000::put them out there and they get to take the fall for whatever you've done. I think that's
0:09:33.500000 - 0:09:38.100000::the plot of a new movie called Infinity Pool. That's the plot of where it's first divorce.
0:09:38.100000 - 0:09:46.300000::That was me. That was my twin. That was Lonnie. Oh my God. Lonnie is really scary. Can we
0:09:46.300000 - 0:09:52.300000::get a new Lonnie for a second? Sure. So Lonnie. Where do you have for breakfast, Lonnie?
0:09:52.300000 - 0:09:59.700000::Breakfast? I just do lunch in there. This is how this is how you...

0:10:00 - 0:10:02::We just say Caribbean Caribbean food yeah
0:10:04 - 0:10:07.420000::Any chicken and what are you looking at Lonnie? What are you looking at right now?
0:10:10.420000 - 0:10:18.320000::Eric and I just say you need to stop doing that voice and just kind of pull that that whole persona back and because I know you've been you've been
0:10:18.800000 - 0:10:20.800000::you have been
0:10:20.800000 - 0:10:22.800000::Sort of Lonnie more than Eric
0:10:22.800000 - 0:10:27.800000::Yeah, a lot of your normal life and I feel like Lonnie's kind of taking over
0:10:28.120000 - 0:10:31.800000::Well, it's a defense mechanism because our brain is a protector
0:10:31.800000 - 0:10:35.820000::I didn't realize Lonnie was inside of me until my parents got divorced in 2017
0:10:36.360000 - 0:10:43.120000::And I mean, I remember I invited you guys all over I'm making fucking shot shot and beer combos and Lonnie came right the fuck out
0:10:43.920000 - 0:10:50.300000::Yeah, yeah, you were doing right. Yeah Lonnie. Yeah, we were like, hey man. How's the divorce going?
0:10:50.300000 - 0:10:52.300000::What the fuck is
0:10:54.300000 - 0:10:58.460000::It's right yeah, right. Yeah, that's a good way like
0:10:58.460000 - 0:11:03.580000::Lonnie's parents are not divorced Lonnie's parents are like Lonnie's parents 20 days. Oh, okay. He's an orphan
0:11:03.820000 - 0:11:05.820000::That's true
0:11:05.820000 - 0:11:09.700000::Lonnie's definitely Lonnie was on Titanic. That's for sure the older guys orphan
0:11:10.100000 - 0:11:14.760000::There actually wasn't a tight there was not a iceberg on the Titanic Lonnie just bit through that shit
0:11:16.340000 - 0:11:17.540000::man
0:11:17.540000 - 0:11:24.460000::So well, can you imagine listening to this and people are like shaking their heads like how do these guys fucking pull this shit out of their heads?
0:11:24.660000 - 0:11:31.820000::You tell me I don't have even the confidence to go up and say hello to the bank teller these guys are doing voices that should be on South Park
0:11:32.140000 - 0:11:35.300000::Right, you know these voices should be illegal these
0:11:36.980000 - 0:11:38.980000::These voices
0:11:38.980000 - 0:11:46.780000::You like the Fabio of the audio and you know two two out of the three of us are seasoned voice actors with credits to boot
0:11:47.780000 - 0:11:49.540000::Really?
0:11:49.540000 - 0:11:51.540000::Yeah, aren't you a three of us? Oh?
0:11:52.660000 - 0:11:57.100000::You don't know that Nate you don't know that Nate did an interstitial segment on
0:11:58.740000 - 0:12:04.140000::Dude, what was it? He was a guy on a roller coaster. I didn't know this Nate
0:12:06.660000 - 0:12:11.900000::You should fill your grid up with all the fucking right now two years later. I'm actually humble
0:12:11.900000 - 0:12:16.620000::I don't I don't there's so many more successes that I have that aren't a part of my grid
0:12:16.620000 - 0:12:20.300000::Yes, I did post about the bear because I just
0:12:20.860000 - 0:12:27.980000::Really believe in that show, but there are so many different type of shows on Hallmark and whatever
0:12:28.260000 - 0:12:33.460000::That I'm a part of that's not even on my IMDB that I'm raking in so much cash from
0:12:34.260000 - 0:12:41.380000::But it's just I just believe in being humble, you know totally do you guys think that as an experiment we should get
0:12:41.940000 - 0:12:48.740000::Some of these kind of predatory agents that you pay for that can get you like a bit part in Hallmark
0:12:49.860000 - 0:12:55.660000::Like a coastal rural and all mark movie for four thousand dollars you pay them and they hook it up with their friend and
0:12:56.260000 - 0:13:00.260000::Buying or play the play kind of thing. What's the experiment?
0:13:01.060000 - 0:13:04.060000::The experiment is we do that and get on some amazing TV
0:13:04.580000 - 0:13:08.700000::Maybe you know there's whole Christian channels that have awesome programming that we could kind of
0:13:09.300000 - 0:13:14.860000::Start to the WGA does not touch you know what I'll tell you what there those aren't unionized

0:14:44.220000 - 0:14:47.380000::I don't even have to say this but I'm turning it on on to see what they're doing
0:14:47.460000 - 0:14:50.020000::Well, it's the most rated highly show in the world right now
0:14:50.380000 - 0:14:53.100000::They don't have you know what MSNBC

0:15:00 - 0:15:02::Matthews don't know what channel he was on the lost
0:15:02 - 0:15:03::Keep over men.
0:15:03 - 0:15:04::He's a lot of fucking money.
0:15:04 - 0:15:05::He doesn't know.
0:15:05 - 0:15:06::He was post about lost dogs.
0:15:06 - 0:15:07::Anthony Oberbeck.
0:15:07 - 0:15:08::It's crazy.
0:15:08 - 0:15:09::They're losing everybody.
0:15:09 - 0:15:11::Anthony Oberbeck was making me laugh.
0:15:11 - 0:15:12::I can't remember why.
0:15:12 - 0:15:13::That's a comedian.
0:15:13 - 0:15:14::He's funny.
0:15:14 - 0:15:15::He's a actor in the comedian.
0:15:15 - 0:15:18::He's hot.
0:15:18 - 0:15:21::Well, you know, this is kind of what I want to know.
0:15:21 - 0:15:28::We're talking about alternate personas and alter egos.
0:15:28 - 0:15:29::Yeah.
0:15:29 - 0:15:36::But when you peel all that away, when all of that, when the curtain is peeled back,
0:15:36 - 0:15:38::what's left?
0:15:38 - 0:15:42::What's the real you?
0:15:42 - 0:15:44::The real me is afraid.
0:15:44 - 0:15:49::Well, what's funny is, you know, my core is fear.
0:15:49 - 0:15:52::And I build everything else out on top of it.
0:15:52 - 0:15:53::Right.
0:15:53 - 0:15:55::There's no joke there.
0:15:55 - 0:15:56::There's no joke there.
0:15:57 - 0:16:02::Well, the thing about the ego is, and I feel like I'm about to tap into a
0:16:02 - 0:16:04::Ben Singer stream of thought right now.
0:16:04 - 0:16:05::Go, go.
0:16:05 - 0:16:07::The ego, right, is something that you want to shed.
0:16:07 - 0:16:10::It's something that you don't want to identify with.
0:16:10 - 0:16:12::You don't want to identify with your identity.
0:16:12 - 0:16:14::Oh my god, it's a book title.
0:16:14 - 0:16:16::You don't want to identify with your identity.
0:16:16 - 0:16:19::And when you make an alter ego, you're making an alternate identity.
0:16:19 - 0:16:21::Now you have two egos, okay?
0:16:21 - 0:16:24::Which means double the pleasure, double the fun, but double the pain.
0:16:25 - 0:16:31::Which means, but there's another side that philosophers argue.
0:16:31 - 0:16:38::Which is that, if you have two egos, can you actually use one of your egos to
0:16:38 - 0:16:44::step outside and get an aerial, aerial view of your other ego in the same way
0:16:44 - 0:16:47::that like Joe Rogan does mushrooms and sees his ego.
0:16:47 - 0:16:51::Right, our DMT and the sonner are in the isolation tank.
0:16:51 - 0:16:55::So is it actually quite healthy to walk around?
0:16:55 - 0:16:58::Oh, this is my, oh you guys don't know this is me.
0:16:58 - 0:17:04::Like the guy who wears really crazy windy clothes, I don't know that means.
0:17:04 - 0:17:08::Right, no, I know you're saying, I think what you're telling us is that we need to
0:17:08 - 0:17:12::go Ron White style and go do an Iowasca ceremony filming.
0:17:12 - 0:17:14::No, no, no, Jack.
0:17:14 - 0:17:16::Is that your alter ego for right now?
0:17:16 - 0:17:20::Oh, that's funny that this is, we, this should have been the alter ego episode.
0:17:20 - 0:17:22::Is these guys?
0:17:22 - 0:17:23::I know.
0:17:23 - 0:17:27::Yeah, with the hilarious, like this is switched to the digital on Zoom, I guess they
0:17:27 - 0:17:33::dropped a new feature we can have an avatar of yourself and they look kind of amazing.
0:17:33 - 0:17:35::They look like Pixar.
0:17:35 - 0:17:36::They look good.
0:17:36 - 0:17:38::Oh god, we are in for it folks.
0:17:38 - 0:17:41::Oh, shit, I just got a good idea for a song.
0:17:41 - 0:17:46::Yo, I just want to help the world and be the most amazing type.
0:17:46 - 0:17:47::I want to do good.
0:17:47 - 0:17:48::I don't want to fight.
0:17:48 - 0:17:50::I want to do evil.
0:17:50 - 0:17:52::I want to kill a cat.
0:17:52 - 0:17:54::Oh my god, don't do this.
0:17:54 - 0:17:56::I'm going to do this.
0:17:56 - 0:17:57::Don't do that.
0:17:57 - 0:17:59::I'm going to kill a cat.
0:17:59 - 0:18:02::Okay, for the listeners who can't see what he's doing.
0:18:02 - 0:18:08::And when he goes into the more kind of whatever, like sound garden voice, he becomes a bald
0:18:08 - 0:18:11::man with a goatee.
0:18:11 - 0:18:15::I was like the half reality gorillas, you know?
0:18:15 - 0:18:19::Oh, the half reality gorillas is catchy.
0:18:19 - 0:18:27::I think my real self is shy.
0:18:27 - 0:18:29::Extremely shy.
0:18:29 - 0:18:37::Because I think when I was a little kid, when I was a little fellow, I was one of the shyest
0:18:37 - 0:18:40::little men on the planet on the face there.
0:18:40 - 0:18:44::Somebody asked my age and I would just kind of like, you know, like kind of just be like.
0:18:44 - 0:18:45::Just on the toes.
0:18:45 - 0:18:50::Kind of look down and just put up my hands like, you know, like instead of talking.
0:18:50 - 0:18:51::God damn.
0:18:51 - 0:18:53::And then everyone fucking hated my ass.
0:18:53 - 0:18:54::Nobody had no friends.
0:18:54 - 0:18:55::You know what I'm saying?
0:18:55 - 0:18:57::You think that's a shy mentality.
0:18:57 - 0:18:58::That's a shy mentality.
0:18:58 - 0:18:59::Everybody probably was shy mentality.
0:18:59 - 0:19:00::Here's the thing.
0:19:00 - 0:19:01::Here's the thing.
0:19:01 - 0:19:02::Excuse me.
0:19:02 - 0:19:08::When I was allegedly as well, a shy child.
0:19:08 - 0:19:13::And Nate, I wonder if this is maybe even one-up in you.
0:19:13 - 0:19:15::Because you can't get more shy than me, dude.
0:19:15 - 0:19:17::I'm one of the shyest men on the planet.
0:19:17 - 0:19:18::Oh, no.
0:19:18 - 0:19:22::Just wait till I expose this truth.
0:19:22 - 0:19:31::When I was in kindergarten, what happened is I was so shy that I was hiding under the desks
0:19:31 - 0:19:33::and they had to take me out of school.
0:19:33 - 0:19:36::Because I was so violently shy that I was literally hiding.
0:19:36 - 0:19:38::And what did they do?
0:19:38 - 0:19:43::They grabbed my ass with a hook old school style and pulled me, held back.
0:19:43 - 0:19:44::Had to run it back.
0:19:44 - 0:19:46::You had to go twice.
0:19:46 - 0:19:47::That's a blessing.
0:19:47 - 0:19:50::We're so shy that it is that he's not already.
0:19:50 - 0:19:55::You're altered your progression in the public school education system.
0:19:55 - 0:19:57::And I still had to be in special needs classes.
0:19:57 - 0:20:00::So you should have graduated 2009.

0:20:00 - 0:20:03.520000::Yeah, well, I feel like I was held back a second.
0:20:03.520000 - 0:20:05.320000::Jack is actually 46.
0:20:07 - 0:20:08::I am old.
0:20:08 - 0:20:10.800000::I think I've said this before, but I couldn't call any,
0:20:10.800000 - 0:20:12.680000::like I hated calling people.
0:20:12.680000 - 0:20:14.480000::I hated talking to strangers.
0:20:14.480000 - 0:20:16.440000::I think I've said this before, but a safe way
0:20:16.440000 - 0:20:18.040000::at the grocery store, you could go to the bakery
0:20:18.040000 - 0:20:19.880000::and ask for a chocolate chip cookie.
0:20:21 - 0:20:22.960000::And I was too afraid to ask for it,
0:20:22.960000 - 0:20:25.840000::even though they're gladly handing these out to kids.
0:20:25.840000 - 0:20:26.680000::I feel that way.
0:20:26.680000 - 0:20:29.520000::So I would make my three-year-old brother go get him for us.
0:20:30.480000 - 0:20:33.680000::I'm like, Aider, 10, get him, dude.
0:20:33.680000 - 0:20:36.120000::You're like a shy mob leader.
0:20:36.120000 - 0:20:36.960000::Yeah, yeah.
0:20:36.960000 - 0:20:38.520000::The most dangerous type.
0:20:38.520000 - 0:20:39.520000::Because you know that.
0:20:39.520000 - 0:20:40.520000::That's an interesting thing.
0:20:40.520000 - 0:20:41.520000::That's so interesting.
0:20:41.520000 - 0:20:42.520000::That's the thing.
0:20:42.520000 - 0:20:47.520000::We were all shy because what did we do while we were in the shadows?
0:20:47.520000 - 0:20:48.520000::In the shadows?
0:20:48.520000 - 0:20:50.520000::What did we do while we were concealed?
0:20:50.520000 - 0:20:51.920000::We turned the oven on.
0:20:51.920000 - 0:20:52.520000::No, no.
0:20:52.520000 - 0:20:53.320000::Observe.
0:20:53.320000 - 0:20:54.720000::We observed.
0:20:54.720000 - 0:20:55.520000::Observe.
0:20:55.520000 - 0:20:57.960000::We observed the human condition in a way that the popular kids
0:20:57.960000 - 0:20:58.800000::couldn't.
0:20:58.800000 - 0:20:59.800000::Through watching.
0:20:59.800000 - 0:21:00.800000::So it's all a popular kids.
0:21:00.800000 - 0:21:03.200000::There's a reason why you're not on the bear.
0:21:03.200000 - 0:21:04.200000::There's a reason why you're not.
0:21:04.200000 - 0:21:05.200000::There's a reason why you're not.
0:21:05.200000 - 0:21:06.200000::There's a reason why you're not.
0:21:06.200000 - 0:21:07.200000::You're not tuning out the news.
0:21:07.200000 - 0:21:08.200000::Kids.
0:21:08.200000 - 0:21:14.800000::I feel like I observed in such an obvious way that was so apparent to everybody around me.
0:21:14.800000 - 0:21:20.160000::I was just wide-eyed, like really close to the popular kids, just kind of staring and
0:21:20.160000 - 0:21:22.960000::like just downloading all this information.
0:21:22.960000 - 0:21:24.800000::It was not subtle at all.
0:21:24.800000 - 0:21:28.120000::I was heavily observing.
0:21:28.120000 - 0:21:32.640000::My first experience with an alter ego, I think, came when I brought this topic up a few
0:21:32.640000 - 0:21:33.640000::times.
0:21:33.640000 - 0:21:40.720000::But when I joined that Christian Jazz Choir called Celebration, select Jazz Choir, eight
0:21:40.720000 - 0:21:45.960000::boys, eight girls dominated every middle school jazz competition in the fucking Northwest.
0:21:45.960000 - 0:21:46.960000::Lionel Hampton.
0:21:46.960000 - 0:21:52.120000::One Lionel Hampton Jazz Fest in Boise, Idaho, or I mean, Moscow, Idaho, ten years ago.
0:21:52.120000 - 0:21:53.320000::You weren't dancing too, right?
0:21:53.320000 - 0:21:54.320000::This isn't the...
0:21:54.320000 - 0:21:55.320000::You were dancing as well.
0:21:55.320000 - 0:22:03.080000::Well, there's no dancing, but our musical director, Ms. Pumphrey, like everybody else would
0:22:03.080000 - 0:22:07.760000::show up in fucking T-shirts and looking all poor with jeans and busted shoes and that.
0:22:07.760000 - 0:22:11.680000::But we showed up in fucking suits and they had like, we had pink ties.
0:22:11.680000 - 0:22:14.560000::Not hot pink ties, because in 2005 or so.
0:22:14.560000 - 0:22:16.560000::Yeah, that was the new black.
0:22:16.560000 - 0:22:17.560000::That was the fucking thing.
0:22:17.560000 - 0:22:18.560000::Shini.
0:22:18.560000 - 0:22:20.240000::Basically, the Trump tie.
0:22:20.240000 - 0:22:22.560000::And we are on stage like...
0:22:22.640000 - 0:22:24.560000::Down, saying, Tom is way...
0:22:26.560000 - 0:22:30.400000::Scatting, getting up there fucking, scatting like crazy.
0:22:30.400000 - 0:22:32.760000::And they had a bopping around, moving like this.
0:22:32.760000 - 0:22:33.760000::That's not shy.
0:22:33.760000 - 0:22:35.760000::No, no, it wasn't shy.
0:22:35.760000 - 0:22:36.760000::You were saying that's...
0:22:36.760000 - 0:22:37.760000::That was your escape.
0:22:37.760000 - 0:22:44.640000::My first brush with feeling like I liked attention like this was a karaoke night with
0:22:44.640000 - 0:22:49.480000::this group because we had a bonding thing every summer at a cabin at once one kid's cabin.
0:22:49.480000 - 0:22:53.880000::And I sang on accident, they picked me to sing a Britney Spears song.
0:22:53.880000 - 0:22:55.680000::Oost I did it again.
0:22:55.680000 - 0:22:57.680000::And I'm up there and I was...
0:22:57.680000 - 0:22:59.680000::People were laughing but they were laughing with me.
0:22:59.680000 - 0:23:01.680000::Yeah, I mean, because I was doing like...
0:23:01.680000 - 0:23:02.680000::Of course.
0:23:02.680000 - 0:23:06.080000::Like Maggie Simpson dancing to Britney Spears and that one up to the Simpson's house.
0:23:06.080000 - 0:23:07.880000::Kind of dancing all short.
0:23:07.880000 - 0:23:08.880000::Talented.
0:23:08.880000 - 0:23:11.880000::And people were laughing and I was like, yeah, I made this shit.
0:23:11.880000 - 0:23:12.880000::That's your origin story.
0:23:12.880000 - 0:23:13.880000::His Britney Spears.
0:23:13.880000 - 0:23:14.880000::I need more of this shit.
0:23:14.880000 - 0:23:15.880000::The mental health goat.
0:23:16.480000 - 0:23:20.080000::Can we see real quick if Eric, you still got it?
0:23:20.080000 - 0:23:21.080000::Let's do a joy-tack.

0:23:23.080000 - 0:23:29.280000::If you're listening in some crazy headphones right now boost it up or maybe don't because
0:23:29.280000 - 0:23:30.280000::we're probably a lot, a lot more.
0:23:30.280000 - 0:23:31.280000::You want me to do what?
0:23:31.280000 - 0:23:32.280000::Harmonize your sketch.
0:23:32.280000 - 0:23:34.280000::Harmonize with me and Jack.
0:23:34.280000 - 0:23:36.280000::And then let me scan because...
0:23:36.280000 - 0:23:37.280000::Okay, here.

0:25:00 - 0:25:02::Yeah, that's a
0:25:04.880000 - 0:25:09.440000::My god, yeah, little Lonnie was in there. I definitely saw little Lonnie in there
0:25:09.440000 - 0:25:14.160000::Well everybody else is doing kind of like 1920s, you know flappers tile scatting
0:25:14.160000 - 0:25:17.520000::I'm like why don't you do a little bit differently?
0:25:17.520000 - 0:25:20.880000::You sounded like a special need tree in it from to moan and boombo's world
0:25:25.360000 - 0:25:27.360000::That's a special tree
0:25:30.080000 - 0:25:32.080000::D.O.E.
0:25:32.080000 - 0:25:34.560000::You sound like you're trying to speak in another language
0:25:35.120000 - 0:25:36.560000::If you met an alien and they were like
0:25:39.200000 - 0:25:42.160000::Would it sound amazing like that? Well, that would be normal
0:25:42.560000 - 0:25:45.840000::That would be normal if you met an alien and they were like if you met an alien and they
0:25:46.320000 - 0:25:48.320000::Came out to you and they went like
0:25:48.320000 - 0:25:52.320000::Hello sir. How are you doing today? Can I get you something? Oh, that's what you and you got to worry
0:25:52.640000 - 0:25:58.240000::Trust that that's when you got to worry. Yeah, they've been watching you in study and like Nate Nate creepy ass with the binoculars
0:25:58.320000 - 0:26:04.240000::Right sitting in the back. I'll tell you what you don't want to meet the smooth aliens because they're space smooth
0:26:04.240000 - 0:26:07.680000::That'll all close they've known they're so advanced. They have no need for clothes or hair
0:26:08.320000 - 0:26:13.440000::You want to meet the most busted looking harrier's alien with fucking jewelry all over them
0:26:13.440000 - 0:26:16.480000::And they look like they're coming from a they flew in from a space hut
0:26:17.440000 - 0:26:19.440000::All over them. Yeah, scats
0:26:20.080000 - 0:26:21.600000::Who well?
0:26:21.600000 - 0:26:23.600000::You
0:26:24.160000 - 0:26:26.160000::God
0:26:26.960000 - 0:26:28.800000::Don't you think that's the opposite of true
0:26:30.400000 - 0:26:35.360000::Because if you an alien is coming to us and they have no hair
0:26:36 - 0:26:38::What it means is they come from a soft environment
0:26:38.560000 - 0:26:41.840000::And I would know because I have not one single body hair and that's true
0:26:42.240000 - 0:26:44.720000::Right, and I'm soft as can be and I'm a vulnerable man
0:26:45.040000 - 0:26:47.360000::But if they come and watching in DC is very soft
0:26:47.600000 - 0:26:51.280000::I wasn't in DC the air is they got to keep it healthier because that's where the president is
0:26:51.680000 - 0:26:53.600000::So we're all pampered AC outdoors
0:26:54.080000 - 0:26:57.280000::And you can feed the squirrels if you're ever watching in DC on them all feed the squirrels
0:26:57.520000 - 0:27:00.720000::The question is would you rather be chilling with a cling on or with a Vulcan?
0:27:01.040000 - 0:27:04.560000::Would you rather get a fucking crazy ass buccacchi from some alien moon man?
0:27:05.600000 - 0:27:07.600000::Whoa, whoa, whoa, chill dude
0:27:07.760000 - 0:27:08.960000::What man?
0:27:10 - 0:27:12::Why did I do that
0:27:13.760000 - 0:27:15.760000::Buccacchi from a bunch of moon man
0:27:15.760000 - 0:27:22.320000::Well, if you surrounded the entire moon with some interdimensional busters and they were making a halo basically
0:27:23.680000 - 0:27:27.840000::That's how they build the fucking internet that's how they do the interdimensional wormhole
0:27:28.240000 - 0:27:30.800000::Well, why do you think that moon well, all right, let's talk about something more
0:27:31.520000 - 0:27:36.160000::Because this is about serious junctures with some of the human neuronics neurons
0:27:36.960000 - 0:27:41.760000::Joytastic hilarious alien idea, but I'm just gonna save it because I can't burn this one
0:27:42.160000 - 0:27:46.800000::We talk about aliens so much on this shit, but I feel like it's not discussed enough
0:27:47.440000 - 0:27:50.880000::It's not discussed enough, especially with the grouched testimonies
0:27:51.840000 - 0:27:58.960000::And if anybody listen, I'm not gonna say anything more, but if anybody listening to this has any secret information that they want to share with me
0:28:00 - 0:28:06.800000::Hit my line hit my email hit my anything and we can discuss because I need to form a community of resistors
0:28:07.360000 - 0:28:13.600000::And if anybody has $2,000 that they don't mind parting with I swear I will get you back. It's not a big deal
0:28:15.120000 - 0:28:17.120000::So we do that as a section of the podcast
0:28:17.360000 - 0:28:18.320000::Hey, what's up everybody?
0:28:18.400000 - 0:28:23.680000::The second where we're gonna look at what offered things that we you are gonna let us pawn
0:28:24.960000 - 0:28:27.440000::The pawn corner we should WN
0:28:28 - 0:28:30::We should do a who's the richest
0:28:30.160000 - 0:28:38.480000::competition and if you are a listener email our joytakers email with a screenshot of your bank account and don't forge it and the richest person
0:28:38.960000 - 0:28:42.640000::You know, we should do we'll send them even more money because we want them to double it
0:28:42.960000 - 0:28:46.800000::We'll double it if you've been my last all your money. We swear we'll double it
0:28:46.880000 - 0:28:54.080000::Well, that's great. That's a joy tactics pod at gmail.com. Please give us a screenshot of your bank account
0:28:54.640000 - 0:29:00.240000::Number who is the richest fucking person that's listening to this? Yeah, I have a theory. I think it's
0:29:00.880000 - 0:29:02.960000::How what do you guys think it? What do you guys think that?
0:29:03.520000 - 0:29:08.880000::In the bank account this is gonna make me sound poor because I want to say like oh they have a hundred thousand dollars in their bank
0:29:09.360000 - 0:29:15.120000::I mean that's hilarious air you think of patron is just throwing around five dollars
0:29:15.200000 - 0:29:18.880000::These people are star. I think the poorest patron is a hundred thousand there
0:29:19.600000 - 0:29:25.360000::I would say the richest. There's probably somebody who's listening right now who has enough crypto to bear you
0:29:25.920000 - 0:29:29.840000::Forever in crypto never to buy a hit out to buy a hit
0:29:30.160000 - 0:29:32.640000::Herter your ass and get away with it. Maybe broad daylight
0:29:33.200000 - 0:29:36.320000::At a panera break. God with a sandwich. Hey
0:29:37.280000 - 0:29:43.200000::They need to sing go ahead. Good. Well, they there's a culture in America where people don't want to talk about
0:29:43.280000 - 0:29:48::They think it's like naughty to talk about your finances. How much money you make this and that
0:29:48.560000 - 0:29:50.800000::But you realize that that's how they are
0:29:51.840000 - 0:29:53.840000::Rooling us from the ruling class you see
0:29:54.480000 - 0:30:00::Because they think oh no, it's not polite to talk about money. It's not polite to talk about finances. Yeah, CIA

0:30:00 - 0:30:05.920000::cheap thrills. Yeah. Money to have fun. That's not what matters. I think everybody should have every
0:30:05.920000 - 0:30:10.960000::morning. You should like, I don't know how this works. Maybe instead of the newspaper, you just
0:30:10.960000 - 0:30:15.120000::get a list of everybody and what how much money they have. I think we're going to see like, wait a
0:30:15.120000 - 0:30:20.160000::minute. None of us have this shit. Right. It's got to be a greeting. He slice them on the neck.
0:30:20.720000 - 0:30:26.960000::Agreed. Like, hey, my name's, hey, Eric 8000. What's up, Jack? 8000K. How are you?
0:30:26.960000 - 0:30:32::Yeah. Yeah. Cause then you know how to bid at because if I meet someone that's rich, I'm
0:30:32 - 0:30:35.680000::obviously going to treat them better. You know what I mean? Well, yeah. I find out this person
0:30:35.680000 - 0:30:39.280000::has $800,000. Yeah. You're getting a little more from me. You're getting a kiss on the neck,
0:30:39.280000 - 0:30:46.160000::whatever you want. I like the salt of the earth type. If I call somebody who's got $80, I know that
0:30:46.160000 - 0:30:55.600000::they would just want to hang out with me. And I am currently in such a large amount of debt that
0:30:55.680000 - 0:31:01.520000::it would make you want to end your life. What type of debt you saw the medical amount of debt that
0:31:01.520000 - 0:31:07.760000::I'm in. How many types of that is from cosmetic, cosmetic medical surgeries and non-cursor.
0:31:07.760000 - 0:31:14.800000::Cosmetic medical surgeries. Many, many, many. All from the neck. You guys have phone debt. No. But

0:31:20.720000 - 0:31:25.360000::And it's already slowing down to the point of it not even being useful anymore.
0:31:25.360000 - 0:31:30.560000::Oh, it'll be private tag. And Apple just broke a trillion dollars.
0:31:30.560000 - 0:31:35.040000::Oh, really? And they need another thousand from me for one one. Can I say something?
0:31:35.040000 - 0:31:39.440000::I have to buy three trillion. Sorry, they're at three trillion. That's the number that we can
0:31:39.440000 - 0:31:44.160000::be comprehend. You know what I mean? Or you guys can't comprehend. I can imagine it in my own ways,
0:31:44.160000 - 0:31:48.560000::but three trillion. Most can't. Well, here's three trillion molecules on one that's all

0:31:58.960000 - 0:32:05.600000::know this? They're about to label Aspert or whatever's in there. The polyphenolutes or whatever.
0:32:05.600000 - 0:32:10.960000::I think that's how you feel. You got the can right there. I'll be right now. Listen to this.
0:32:10.960000 - 0:32:14::What's the feeling reading? What do you think is the most biggest ingredient in this?
0:32:14.560000 - 0:32:19.760000::Finicol water carbonated water, which gives you a soft, a geol canister. Then they have caramel
0:32:19.760000 - 0:32:24.560000::color, which gives you caramel cancer. Then rule number three or ingredient number three.
0:32:25.600000 - 0:32:33.840000::Aspertame. Aspertame. And that's an acronym. Absolutely. So can't stop the
0:32:33.840000 - 0:32:37.840000::polar one. That's not even the worst one. That's not what makes it diet, right? Oh, it's
0:32:37.840000 - 0:32:42.400000::phosphoric acid. No, the Aspertame is the sugar replacement. What about finiculate?
0:32:42.400000 - 0:32:46.400000::Finicleicatein. They don't have the finicleicatein. They have phosphoric acid. Potassium
0:32:46.400000 - 0:32:51.680000::bends away to protect the taste. Natural flavors, citric acid and caffeine. Oh, wait a minute.
0:32:51.680000 - 0:32:55.920000::Oh, shit. Wait, what's this? Oh, shit. What is this? Why does it say that? It's not in the
0:32:55.920000 - 0:33:00.320000::ingredients, but there's a whole, it's the biggest thing. It says finic,
0:33:01.600000 - 0:33:08.480000::finelconurex contains phenylalelene in your mouth. Yes. And it's impossible to pronounce.
0:33:09.280000 - 0:33:12.880000::And that's the cancer cousin. I'm not that right. I'm a computer.
0:33:12.880000 - 0:33:16.480000::Is that cancer cousin? Oh, God. It's bigger than the ingredients. Phenylalelene.
0:33:16.480000 - 0:33:18.480000::Phenylalelene. Phenylalelene. Phenylalelene. Phenylalelene.
0:33:18.480000 - 0:33:22.240000::Phenylalelene. And they purposefully did that. They purposefully made it all fucking though.
0:33:22.240000 - 0:33:28.640000::They purposely made that the hardest word on the planet to pronounce. So that the news casters,
0:33:28.640000 - 0:33:31.520000::they have a different, they're like, let's just move on to a different story. We're not even
0:33:31.520000 - 0:33:35.200000::gonna say if we get to that. That's a great idea. Nobody knows how to pronounce it.
0:33:35.200000 - 0:33:41.120000::Then you can't talk about it. I'm gonna kill someone. That's a goddamn way. Jack.
0:33:43.680000 - 0:33:49.200000::I got a good idea for a murder. What? Okay. I'm going to kill somebody.
0:33:50.320000 - 0:33:56.160000::And I'm gonna just do it in a way that's that's really public. I don't care. In a way that's like,
0:33:56.160000 - 0:34:01.120000::whoa, he doesn't care that he just did that. Why? Get him. Go get him. In the cops, maybe they'll
0:34:01.120000 - 0:34:07.520000::get me, but here's the problem. I already went to the DMV or whatever I have to go to and I changed
0:34:07.520000 - 0:34:12.160000::my name legally to something that's crazy to pronounce. So they're not gonna give a rat's ass.
0:34:12.160000 - 0:34:18.880000::Oh, who's this guy? He killed somebody. What's his name? Oh, we can't even tell the news story.
0:34:18.880000 - 0:34:23.760000::His name's too crazy. The name's so long. It's basically the filibuster name so that they can't
0:34:23.760000 - 0:34:28.080000::do nothing to me because they take me to court and the okay, take me to court. But when you read,
0:34:28.720000 - 0:34:34.960000::you have the right to remain silent. Feel like I'm letting me. That's it. James run away by that point.
0:34:35.520000 - 0:34:42::Yeah, by that point, I'm halfway to Egypt. Oh my god. Shout out to Cairo. Cairo.
0:34:44.880000 - 0:34:51.600000::What do you guys think would happen if if I like was in a murder case and went to court?
0:34:51.600000 - 0:34:57.520000::And I just had like a bunch of like smoke bombs on me all the time in court.

0:35:00 - 0:35:04.540000::Like they go only some of your handcoft and you're like cuff to the fucking chair too
0:35:04.540000 - 0:35:08.360000::So it goes off, but then when it's the smoke dissipates you're still right there
0:35:10.560000 - 0:35:13.700000::Like like people are like like
0:35:14.400000 - 0:35:18.460000::Weezing like they can't even see it's pull it's totally pitch black
0:35:19.560000 - 0:35:26.420000::Remember um, but it grandpa from three ninjas the grandpa from three ninjas remember that mr. Miyagi played mr. Miyagi in credit kid course
0:35:26.420000 - 0:35:28.420000::I do

0:35:30.900000 - 0:35:36.540000::Just became a cow for a second to all the listeners. They can't see this shit. So I have to audio audio play it
0:35:37.740000 - 0:35:44.380000::Basically the grandpa and that taught these three white children how to be crazy traditional ninjas
0:35:44.880000 - 0:35:47.640000::You guys haven't seen three ninjas. No, oh
0:35:48.460000 - 0:35:55.780000::These are great movies and one of his things and they say this and digits you your first plan of attack should be to get the fuck out of there
0:35:55.780000 - 0:36:00.880000::Smoke bomb sh leave if adults are trying to kill you fucking run away. That's not my glasses
0:36:02.060000 - 0:36:04.060000::Years ears are a little more intense
0:36:05.020000 - 0:36:07.020000::There's no rules in mind naked
0:36:08.700000 - 0:36:12.660000::Naked digits. Yeah, well you grab on people like and normal digits
0:36:12.660000 - 0:36:17.220000::You try to like use collar chokes and grab the keys and naked digits who you're using the fucking earlobe

0:36:20.560000 - 0:36:23.360000::So you can wrap the ear around and choke them out. Oh

0:36:30.380000 - 0:36:32.380000::Lord, oh you know what I was gonna say
0:36:32.780000 - 0:36:34.780000::After I just did that whole little
0:36:35.780000 - 0:36:40.900000::soliloquy about having a silly name and murdering somebody. Yeah, I
0:36:41.660000 - 0:36:47.820000::Kind of heard some I'm in my soap for the listeners. I'm not kidnapped. I'm actually in my
0:36:49.060000 - 0:36:51.060000::girlfriend's families
0:36:51.460000 - 0:36:53.460000::vacation home basement and
0:36:54.460000 - 0:36:59.900000::I heard some like footsteps right at the top of the stairs right when I finished saying all that embarrassing shit
0:37:00.580000 - 0:37:05::And so I feel kind of stupid now what embarrassing shit. I did like the
0:37:06.100000 - 0:37:10.340000::Kind of like a really weird monologue about killing somebody if my name was for letting him
0:37:10.900000 - 0:37:14.260000::No, no dude if they don't accept you for staying from a little
0:37:14.260000 - 0:37:17.220000::Falenel in the lane and making jokes about that and being yourself
0:37:17.380000 - 0:37:21.580000::Then guess what you should start dating me and be in my family because you'll accept you
0:37:21.580000 - 0:37:27.500000::You know what I'm saying? I love saying for that. That'd be great if they don't but I'm sure they accept you for that because that's hilarious
0:37:27.500000 - 0:37:32.700000::I'm gonna talk about a hilarious monologue and a peek behind the curtain was Eric here when I said this
0:37:32.700000 - 0:37:37.780000::Yes, he was I was just telling Nate before the podcast that this is actually a funny bit that's going on with
0:37:38.020000 - 0:37:41.900000::My girlfriend Raleigh's family. His her parents keep talking shit about Nate
0:37:44.260000 - 0:37:48.580000::I don't know why they've like latched on to hating him and it's really making me laugh just let you know
0:37:48.580000 - 0:37:53.140000::I have sort of psychic abilities of anybody's thinking negatively or talking shit about me
0:37:53.140000 - 0:37:57.540000::It I can feel it in my body and it kind of disrupts my day
0:37:57.540000 - 0:38:00.340000::Yeah, you don't want to reveal a weakness like that Nate
0:38:01.180000 - 0:38:05.860000::Fuck you right dude, but no no no no. I'm all I'm all about transparency
0:38:05.860000 - 0:38:09.260000::You know what I'm saying? I'm all about letting people know what's going on
0:38:09.260000 - 0:38:13.220000::I don't give a fuck about this gate keeping shit. I don't give a shit about that. What do you get?
0:38:13.220000 - 0:38:22.420000::I'm keeping my motorbillies my weaknesses. I don't know that's how you sound kind of like the owner of my gym
0:38:22.700000 - 0:38:26.300000::Caleb pits my gym buddy good friend whatever
0:38:26.820000 - 0:38:33.300000::Potta-Pop-A-Kaster co-host he was telling me he overheard the owner of our gym a shorter big built guy
0:38:34.060000 - 0:38:41.540000::Talking to a new member said like come over here for it. He picked up 220 pound dumbbells. Oh, and the guy comes over
0:38:41.540000 - 0:38:45.020000::He's like can you come over help me for a second. He's like tell me I can't lift this right now
0:38:45.660000 - 0:38:49.900000::And the guy's like you can't lift it. He's like no me that dude tell me I can't lift it
0:38:49.900000 - 0:38:52.180000::He's like you can't lift that and then he
0:38:52.540000 - 0:38:56.020000::Put some up. He's doing the incline press and then he like went like this
0:38:57.020000 - 0:38:59.020000::I got a couple in
0:38:59.740000 - 0:39:01.740000::Like quarter at me
0:39:01.740000 - 0:39:08.380000::That's what you're doing with emotions Nate. I swear to God if somebody like like
0:39:09.380000 - 0:39:16.940000::Legitimately doubts me. It's it's it's the Michael Jordan syndrome. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, I mean Michael Jordan are pretty much the same
0:39:17.620000 - 0:39:20.140000::Psychologically, yeah, I'm not all the
0:39:20.140000 - 0:39:26.860000::backgrounds in Carolina if someone tells me I can't do something I then I can't fucking literally I can't surpass that verbal barrier
0:39:27.860000 - 0:39:29.860000::Yeah, and I'm right in the middle of it
0:39:30.580000 - 0:39:37.500000::And I just don't understand when somebody says something about me and then maybe late much much later
0:39:37.500000 - 0:39:41.260000::I'll realize like oh fuck did they not like me but it's too late at that point
0:39:42.220000 - 0:39:46.760000::When the last time you guys stood up for yourself and a crazy what mine's only been in my dreams
0:39:46.760000 - 0:39:49.540000::Everyone I have now I feel like I'm standing up for myself
0:39:49.540000 - 0:39:51.540000::But you're ready for yourself
0:39:51.780000 - 0:39:59.780000::You're standing up to crazy octopuses. Oh, yeah, she that you can't imagine I've been standing my therapist has been complimenting me lately for standing up for myself

0:40:00 - 0:40:02::Good
0:40:02.780000 - 0:40:09.820000::Thanks man good if you listen to him and you as well, okay, so if you're listening here's a little practice ready give me 20 bucks
0:40:11.620000 - 0:40:17.840000::Ready now don't there you go you just stood up for his up. Oh shit that easy in a small way
0:40:17.840000 - 0:40:23.680000::Yeah, people think it's like this grand gesture and I'm not an easy guy to stand up to either by the way Eric pick me up
0:40:23.680000 - 0:40:26.180000::Take me to the airport dude, please now. Thank you. Okay
0:40:27.020000 - 0:40:29.540000::Okay, yeah, okay, yeah, I know I know okay
0:40:29.540000 - 0:40:32.620000::I don't think I've ever stood up for myself one single time in my life
0:40:32.620000 - 0:40:35.180000::I've always caved in 100% yeah
0:40:35.300000 - 0:40:40.140000::If you want me to do something just ask me and I'll do it and I'll and I will
0:40:41.300000 - 0:40:43.140000::I think I will bury my own personal
0:40:43.140000 - 0:40:48.340000::We are pushovers. We are pretty predictably that type of person. I'm like, okay, you want to ask me to do something?
0:40:48.340000 - 0:40:50.780000::You want me to do something? I don't want to do yeah, I'm gonna fucking do it
0:40:50.780000 - 0:40:53.020000::But then I want to talk shit about you for three years behind back
0:40:53.380000 - 0:40:57.900000::And then I'll do you know again and again again. Yep, you know, but I will talk shit about you
0:40:57.900000 - 0:41:01.940000::But not probably a lot of nice as fuck where's the line between
0:41:02.740000 - 0:41:04.740000::standing up for yourself and
0:41:05.940000 - 0:41:12.420000::Doing something nice for somebody else and I'll give you an example. Yeah, there you go taking somebody
0:41:14.020000 - 0:41:15.820000::Somebody ask you
0:41:15.820000 - 0:41:20.620000::Hey, can you pick me up from the airport? I don't think anybody wants to really do that
0:41:20.900000 - 0:41:28.140000::Or or or helping somebody move even some worse. It's like that's even more effort. Yeah, you want to help somebody move
0:41:28.540000 - 0:41:30.540000::Somebody ask you hey, can you help me move?
0:41:30.940000 - 0:41:32.940000::Nobody and the fuck wants to do that
0:41:33.540000 - 0:41:38.900000::So what where where's the line at? Yeah, because you could stand up for yourself and say no
0:41:38.900000 - 0:41:39.940000::I don't want to fucking do that
0:41:39.940000 - 0:41:46.500000::But you could choose the other the joy tactic maybe yeah, which is to say hey, I want to give back to the world and
0:41:46.780000 - 0:41:53.460000::Giving is is you're gonna receive more from the universe if you give back constantly. I got a so to speak say this
0:41:53.460000 - 0:42:00.500000::It depends on the person because guess what I helped Jack move one time and I would say it's the worst move that anybody could imagine
0:42:00.500000 - 0:42:02.500000::And what did I do earlier that day?
0:42:02.980000 - 0:42:07.300000::What did you do that day earlier that day? I helped you move you help me yeah, right?
0:42:07.300000 - 0:42:10.580000::We were living in the same apartment. We were both moving out that day, but here's
0:42:10.580000 - 0:42:17.540000::Here's the difference. We rented a small hybrid crossover Honda SUV to move our shit
0:42:17.540000 - 0:42:21.500000::I had one load of stuff to take a half a load
0:42:21.500000 - 0:42:25.460000::What differences you were moving into a furnished apartment right?
0:42:26.100000 - 0:42:28.840000::Right, right, right, so I didn't have and I didn't have that much shit
0:42:28.840000 - 0:42:30.840000::So we just moved did one move
0:42:30.840000 - 0:42:38.900000::Want to Bushwick unloaded pretty easy then jacks stuff comes into play and there's no boxes, but it garbage bags
0:42:39.140000 - 0:42:41.140000::I would tell you that about
0:42:41.140000 - 0:42:46.600000::50 garbage garbage bag. I'll put anything in a garbage bag. I don't do boxes do that literally throw
0:42:46.600000 - 0:42:52.420000::Everything organized. I'm not hitting all rap a TV in a blanket throwing a garbage bag with all the
0:42:52.420000 - 0:42:55.460000::Superweather and just get in there's a picture
0:42:55.460000 - 0:43:01.140000::Maybe we can pick the picture on the patreon because it's just like the funniest it is the most but it was fun
0:43:01.140000 - 0:43:06.300000::I was I was what my ass off but I was with my best bud so pretty pre-vax a good time
0:43:06.540000 - 0:43:12.740000::You know what I mean that was that in the pandemic. Yeah, what the hell that was August 2020 wow
0:43:13.660000 - 0:43:18.540000::But I'm saying if you like the prayer like you know what I mean if I don't really fuck with you that was fun
0:43:18.540000 - 0:43:20.300000::I'm not I'm not responding. You know what I mean?
0:43:20.300000 - 0:43:22.300000::I'll pick your eyes from the airport up anytime Nate
0:43:22.460000 - 0:43:25.860000::Yeah, if it's someone else because we live together, right?
0:43:26.740000 - 0:43:32.680000::But that was tough that was no more that was just us being kind of dumb and not renting a truck and renting instead a
0:43:33.180000 - 0:43:35.180000::small car
0:43:35.580000 - 0:43:39.400000::And getting ratchet straps and oh yeah, we did that to the
0:43:40.380000 - 0:43:44.180000::I still got those ratchet straps. Hmm, and I'm about to move again perhaps
0:43:44.780000 - 0:43:46.780000::Hmm and guess what else?
0:43:47.420000 - 0:43:51.060000::What what dude? I can't remember Nate. What were you just saying?
0:43:52.820000 - 0:43:56.580000::I don't know you just said something that I was going to
0:43:57.260000 - 0:43:59.260000::Incorporate my
0:43:59.260000 - 0:44:01.260000::Well, Eric, where did you just say?
0:44:02.100000 - 0:44:06.180000::Okay, wait no because this is this is a good mental challenge

0:52:24.280000 - 0:52:27.680000::like a mental coach for Kobe Bryant or something
0:52:28.360000 - 0:52:30.360000::athletes and
0:52:30.360000 - 0:52:33.480000::His sort of theories that you create a persona to
0:52:34.920000 - 0:52:41.640000::Embodied the qualities that you want to become so the the in this book he
0:52:42.680000 - 0:52:45.960000::I think the example is like Kobe was the black mom
0:52:45.960000 - 0:52:51.320000::But okay, and that was his alternate persona that he created where whenever he was on the court
0:52:51.320000 - 0:52:54.320000::He wasn't Kobe Bryant. He was the black mom
0:52:54.320000 - 0:52:58.080000::But the black mom book wins championship after championship
0:52:58.080000 - 0:53:01.400000::You put all that pressure on them. Yeah, just to kill you know

0:53:22.880000 - 0:53:28.480000::Should we this should be easy? This should be the easiest in the world for us. Should we say what gave us joy in our alter ego?
0:53:29.480000 - 0:53:32.240000::And then announce your name at the beginning of what
0:53:33.200000 - 0:53:35.200000::Okay, Eric
