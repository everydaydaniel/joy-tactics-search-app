0:04:34 - 0:04:36::Wait wait wait wait.
0:04:36 - 0:04:40::Okay so the time I was scared and that poor neighbor was there.
0:04:40 - 0:04:44::I thought I saw a ghost or a witch in the woods something.
0:04:44 - 0:04:45::Yeah.
0:04:45 - 0:04:47::I think it was someone living in a tent in the woods.
0:04:47 - 0:04:52::And I was like standing over my bike with like straddling my bike.
0:04:52 - 0:04:57.160000::I think I've already told this on the podcast but I dropped the bike and the gear was exposed
0:04:57.160000 - 0:05:00::and I ripped my whole shin open on the bike.

0:05:00 - 0:05:02.760000::and get that to go get stitches that night.
0:05:02.760000 - 0:05:03.600000::That's rare.
0:05:03.600000 - 0:05:05.320000::And that was out of fear.
0:05:06.440000 - 0:05:09.120000::And I think we can learn an important lesson
0:05:09.120000 - 0:05:11.040000::from that anecdote.
0:05:11.040000 - 0:05:13.520000::What's curious is that poor person in the woods
0:05:13.520000 - 0:05:14.760000::that was just trying to survive
0:05:14.760000 - 0:05:17.040000::and live in the abandoned lot,
0:05:17.040000 - 0:05:18.880000::they weren't gonna come hurt me.
0:05:18.880000 - 0:05:23.600000::What hurt me was my reaction, my gut instinct to run.
0:05:23.600000 - 0:05:24.680000::You know what I mean?
0:05:24.680000 - 0:05:26.640000::My fear actually hurt me.
0:05:26.640000 - 0:05:29.320000::The thing I was afraid of didn't touch me at all.
0:05:29.320000 - 0:05:31.800000::But the fear injures me.
0:05:31.800000 - 0:05:33.120000::How curious is this?
0:05:33.120000 - 0:05:33.960000::What?
0:05:33.960000 - 0:05:36.280000::The only thing to fear is fear itself.
0:05:36.280000 - 0:05:37.440000::Yeah.
0:05:37.440000 - 0:05:38.720000::I hardly need to say the end of it
0:05:38.720000 - 0:05:41.080000::because it's so known.
0:05:41.080000 - 0:05:43.160000::You wanted to say that really fast.
0:05:43.160000 - 0:05:45.400000::Well, I wanted to get to it as quick as possible
0:05:45.400000 - 0:05:49::because people are saying, I know this man.
0:05:49 - 0:05:50.960000::Do you really think they're really hungry for?
0:05:50.960000 - 0:05:52.160000::It's very tough.
0:05:52.160000 - 0:05:52.960000::To a whore.
0:05:54.800000 - 0:05:56.800000::That's very well said, Eric.
0:06:00.320000 - 0:06:02.640000::I'm sorry about your ankle.
0:06:02.640000 - 0:06:06.720000::Was that a president who did that?
0:06:06.720000 - 0:06:07.680000::Who said that?
0:06:07.680000 - 0:06:09.920000::It was for a very short period of his life.
0:06:09.920000 - 0:06:12.040000::That was trimming when they dropped the atom bomb.
0:06:12.040000 - 0:06:14.160000::No, it wasn't.

0:06:15 - 0:06:15.920000::You don't know that.
0:06:15.920000 - 0:06:16.760000::You don't know what this is.
0:06:16.760000 - 0:06:17.760000::It was one of them.
0:06:17.760000 - 0:06:19.400000::It was white, the eyes and the power.
0:06:19.400000 - 0:06:20.720000::The white?
0:06:20.720000 - 0:06:25.600000::You don't think it was actually between the white...

0:07:30.400000 - 0:07:32.400000::fears for itself.
0:07:32.400000 - 0:07:36.800000::He who comes for Kid Cuddy shall be cut down by Eric Ray Hill.

0:07:46.800000 - 0:07:50.800000::The only thing that fears for itself is the only thing to love is love itself.
0:07:50.800000 - 0:07:51.800000::Do you see what I'm saying?
0:07:51.800000 - 0:07:52.800000::I wouldn't imagine that.
0:07:52.800000 - 0:07:56.800000::I don't understand any of those phrases.
0:07:56.800000 - 0:07:57.800000::Right.
0:07:57.800000 - 0:08:01.920000::The only thing to fear right of our heads.
0:08:01.920000 - 0:08:03.920000::I agree, actually.
0:08:03.920000 - 0:08:07.080000::I'm tempted to say I disagree because I find understanding.
0:08:07.080000 - 0:08:10.440000::You know, there's no such thing as understanding or not understanding in a vacuum.
0:08:10.440000 - 0:08:15.400000::You find understanding within the bounds of the confines.
0:08:15.400000 - 0:08:16.320000::But I like fear.
0:08:16.320000 - 0:08:17.880000::I love fear.
0:08:17.880000 - 0:08:21.440000::When I think about most of the times in my life when I feel for your Eric Pay attention,
0:08:21.440000 - 0:08:22.440000::Eric Pay attention.
0:08:22.440000 - 0:08:23.440000::I think of most of the times.
0:08:23.440000 - 0:08:24.440000::Okay.
0:08:24.440000 - 0:08:25.440000::Cool.
0:08:25.440000 - 0:08:30.120000::When I think of most of the times I've been afraid of my life realistically, it's when
0:08:30.120000 - 0:08:37.320000::something fun and positive has been happening on a roller coaster in a convertible breaking
0:08:37.320000 - 0:08:43.280000::the speed limit with my best friends going skateboarding off of a high thing.
0:08:43.280000 - 0:08:45.160000::Yesterday I felt fear but it wasn't fun.
0:08:45.160000 - 0:08:46.160000::I'll give them that.
0:08:46.160000 - 0:08:49.080000::I was sitting in a chair and all of a sudden I felt like I was falling deeper and deeper
0:08:49.080000 - 0:08:52.080000::into the chair and I had to stand up and get glass of water.
0:08:52.080000 - 0:08:54::Well, was it a bean bag?
0:08:54 - 0:08:55::No.
0:08:55 - 0:09:00.400000::Okay, then you should be scared because those other chairs are fixed in place.
0:09:00.400000 - 0:09:01.400000::Right.
0:09:01.400000 - 0:09:02.400000::That wasn't fun.
0:09:02.400000 - 0:09:03.400000::Shhh.
0:09:03.400000 - 0:09:06.920000::But other than the rare exceptions, fear is usually it's like an it.
0:09:06.920000 - 0:09:08.880000::It's like a mental brain itch.
0:09:08.880000 - 0:09:12.200000::You know, itching is pain but it's a positive pain.
0:09:12.200000 - 0:09:13.200000::You know what I'm saying?
0:09:13.200000 - 0:09:15.640000::Yeah, of course so.
0:09:15.640000 - 0:09:16.640000::So interesting.
0:09:16.640000 - 0:09:18.640000::It's like an fear.
0:09:18.640000 - 0:09:19.640000::That's fear.

0:09:26.320000 - 0:09:30.520000::But that's what they want you to think is that fear is something to be afraid of.
0:09:30.520000 - 0:09:31.520000::You see?
0:09:31.520000 - 0:09:32.720000::Because then you're going to do what?
0:09:32.720000 - 0:09:34.480000::Oh, I'm afraid of having a stroke.
0:09:34.480000 - 0:09:37.880000::I'm going to buy this non-gym neographic cheese.

0:09:50.640000 - 0:09:55.260000::I'm frustrated because I have ideas and I'm literally mad at my brain for not keeping
0:09:55.260000 - 0:09:59.440000::up vocabulary-wise with the ideas that I already know what I mean.

0:10:00 - 0:10:03.080000::What's that skill fluency in English? I?

0:11:06.240000 - 0:11:12.360000::Yeah, that's what troubled me she said well, I mean you guys don't really talk about anything
0:11:13.760000 - 0:11:16.720000::Wow, I wish that was possible

0:11:24.960000 - 0:11:26.960000::Sounds like we're talking about nothing right
0:11:28.200000 - 0:11:35::Below the surface though look below the surface and maybe it's because we are so liberal coded and she's conservative coded
0:11:35.960000 - 0:11:42.660000::Bingo win talker language what yeah, what's that
0:11:42.660000 - 0:11:53::What's a win talker language with the Navajo's in World War two we use they would use their Native American language to fool the

0:15:25.760000 - 0:15:26.600000::There I am.
0:15:26.600000 - 0:15:28.080000::The orange orchard.
0:15:28.080000 - 0:15:29.880000::No, I don't know that is.
0:15:29.880000 - 0:15:32.840000::I'm sitting on a basketball court.
0:15:32.840000 - 0:15:35.360000::I probably have red and black Nike's on or something.
0:15:35.360000 - 0:15:38.760000::I'm about six or seven years old.
0:15:38.760000 - 0:15:40.520000::I've probably got Alan Iverson, Jersey on,
0:15:40.520000 - 0:15:45.680000::and some crazy baggy jeans with some Chinese
0:15:45.680000 - 0:15:48.240000::blighters and dragons on them and red.
0:15:48.240000 - 0:15:49.680000::And pink eye.
0:15:49.680000 - 0:15:50.640000::And pink eye.
0:15:50.640000 - 0:15:55.080000::And yeah, whatever.
0:15:55.080000 - 0:15:57.200000::And I had a girlfriend for a year and a half.
0:15:57.200000 - 0:15:58.720000::And then what happens?
0:15:58.720000 - 0:16:01.040000::Awesome.
0:16:01.040000 - 0:16:05.080000::Somebody hits me in the head with what?
0:16:05.080000 - 0:16:05.840000::An orange?
0:16:05.840000 - 0:16:10.280000::A plastic bag full of oranges.
0:16:10.280000 - 0:16:11.800000::Like really hard?
0:16:11.800000 - 0:16:13.840000::Yeah, really hard.
0:16:13.840000 - 0:16:15.880000::Oh.
0:16:15.880000 - 0:16:23.200000::For some reason, it really did knock oranges out of the out
0:16:23.200000 - 0:16:25::of my world, man.
0:16:25 - 0:16:27.880000::It really worked.
0:16:27.880000 - 0:16:36.680000::It got through the, it permeated the cell membrane of my brain to make me not like them.
0:16:36.680000 - 0:16:41.040000::I think you need to give the air, whatever you did to conquer the airplane fear, which was
0:16:41.040000 - 0:16:42.040000::by the way, commendable.
0:16:42.040000 - 0:16:46.080000::I haven't said that to you yet, but I did think I never had a fear of airplanes.
0:16:46.080000 - 0:16:47.080000::I did that.
0:16:47.080000 - 0:16:54.920000::But I think you need to do that treatment to oranges, dude, in citrus in general, because
0:16:54.920000 - 0:16:55.920000::here's the deal.
0:16:55.920000 - 0:16:56.920000::No, because I have more.
0:16:57.080000 - 0:17:00.520000::No, no, no, listen, Jack, you need to open your ears and just listen for a second, because
0:17:00.520000 - 0:17:01.520000::you should have more.
0:17:01.520000 - 0:17:02.520000::I eat citrus.
0:17:02.520000 - 0:17:03.520000::I eat lemons.
0:17:03.520000 - 0:17:04.520000::Really?
0:17:04.520000 - 0:17:06.520000::I'll have a kiwi.
0:17:06.520000 - 0:17:11.280000::And because we just stopped at the diner.
0:17:11.280000 - 0:17:15.720000::And this wonderful server was like, can I, I'm going to get you some water.
0:17:15.720000 - 0:17:17.600000::Would you like lemon in it?
0:17:17.600000 - 0:17:19.120000::And I was like, yes, please.
0:17:19.120000 - 0:17:21.120000::That adds a little brightness to the water.
0:17:21.120000 - 0:17:22.120000::Jack said no, thanks.
0:17:22.120000 - 0:17:25.080000::She must have not heard it because she brought a lemon over anyways.
0:17:25.080000 - 0:17:26.080000::What a jack.
0:17:26.480000 - 0:17:31.720000::You went, put it to the side and didn't even use it in the water.
0:17:31.720000 - 0:17:34.160000::Oh, we just got some shrimp.
0:17:34.160000 - 0:17:38.040000::Should we squeeze, do you guys mind if I squeeze some lemon all over it?
0:17:38.040000 - 0:17:41::Jack goes, please don't do that.
0:17:41 - 0:17:42.560000::That's not true at all, man.
0:17:42.560000 - 0:17:46.200000::Let me stop you right there because you're smirching my name and my dinner editor.
0:17:46.200000 - 0:17:52.240000::If somebody wants to put lemon all over a shrimp or oysters or whatever, go ahead.
0:17:52.240000 - 0:17:54.160000::I'll have some with you with that on it.
0:17:54.160000 - 0:17:55.560000::That's fine.
0:17:55.560000 - 0:17:58.040000::It's not my preference, but that's totally fine.
0:17:58.040000 - 0:17:58.880000::No, I'll enjoy it.
0:17:58.880000 - 0:18:00.560000::It's totally fine.
0:18:00.560000 - 0:18:02.280000::It's just not my preference.
0:18:02.280000 - 0:18:04.440000::I'm not talking about anything.
0:18:04.440000 - 0:18:10.640000::There's, there's something different about oranges and I'm going to try and do the opposite.
0:18:10.640000 - 0:18:17.600000::Oranges occupy a space in the universe for me that nothing else is in.
0:18:17.600000 - 0:18:23.400000::And I'm going to get, and I think instead of me liking oranges, I'm going to try and
0:18:23.400000 - 0:18:25.840000::do the opposite for you all.
0:18:25.840000 - 0:18:31.040000::I'm going to try and get you all and everybody listening to come with me on this side and
0:18:31.040000 - 0:18:32.480000::say, we're done with this shit.
0:18:32.480000 - 0:18:33.480000::We don't need it.
0:18:33.480000 - 0:18:34.480000::We're done with them.
0:18:34.480000 - 0:18:36.080000::Enough is enough.
0:18:36.080000 - 0:18:39.200000::Wake up in the morning, have a nice glass of...
0:18:39.200000 - 0:18:40.440000::Great place.
0:18:40.440000 - 0:18:44.640000::Oh, I do like the sound of that.
0:18:44.640000 - 0:18:47.680000::When's the last time you had a tall couple grape juice?
0:18:47.680000 - 0:18:48.680000::Hmm.
0:18:48.680000 - 0:18:49.680000::Not today.
0:18:49.680000 - 0:18:55.800000::That's after you broke your abstinence month.
0:18:55.800000 - 0:18:58.640000::Cranked it out and then gulp down a bunch of grape juice.
0:18:58.640000 - 0:19:03.520000::It's our journaling about your experience.
0:19:03.520000 - 0:19:14.360000::So, okay, but no orange juice for real.
0:19:14.360000 - 0:19:16.200000::So now we brought up for you.
0:19:16.200000 - 0:19:18.080000::Now we bumped into a real one.
0:19:18.080000 - 0:19:19.080000::How interesting.
0:19:19.080000 - 0:19:22.800000::Should we put that to the side and get to the next fears?
0:19:22.800000 - 0:19:26.400000::Or should we ditch fears altogether and start talking about...
0:19:26.400000 - 0:19:29.280000::And we already did cars.
0:19:29.280000 - 0:19:35.200000::We should postmates fucking 1000 different orange citrus products to your house right now.
0:19:35.200000 - 0:19:36.200000::Yeah.
0:19:36.200000 - 0:19:37.200000::And fucking just...
0:19:37.200000 - 0:19:43.520000::It's so funny, dude, because I open up about something that is a vulnerability for me,
0:19:43.520000 - 0:19:45.680000::my own my crypt and I essentially not the...
0:19:45.680000 - 0:19:48.800000::Except that I don't have actual crypt and I, because I could fucking destroy an orange
0:19:48.800000 - 0:19:50.600000::any day of the week.
0:19:50.600000 - 0:19:55.880000::But it's funny that I bring this up and right away, your first thought is, how can I exploit
0:19:55.880000 - 0:19:58.360000::that to destroy him because he's so much more powerful.
0:19:58.360000 - 0:19:59.960000::No, no, no, no, no.

0:20:00 - 0:20:00.840000::No, no, no.
0:20:00.840000 - 0:20:01.980000::It was interpreting that.
0:20:01.980000 - 0:20:04.840000::Distroing you as the last thing I want to do,
0:20:04.840000 - 0:20:06.420000::it's called exposure therapy.
0:20:06.420000 - 0:20:08.600000::We put an orange that's close to your door,
0:20:08.600000 - 0:20:11.520000::and then we, you know,
0:20:11.520000 - 0:20:14.480000::have you sleeping with one next to you at night time.
0:20:14.480000 - 0:20:18.160000::And eventually, we just have it,
0:20:18.160000 - 0:20:20.960000::you're gonna be eating it for breakfast lunch and dinner,
0:20:20.960000 - 0:20:21.960000::and you're gonna be a day to go.
0:20:21.960000 - 0:20:25::Yeah, like the horse head from Godfather,
0:20:25 - 0:20:29.080000::that will be an orange all-slime stuff.
0:20:29.160000 - 0:20:33.720000::But there's a certain point where you make a decision,
0:20:33.720000 - 0:20:37.440000::whether this is something that you want to put in effort
0:20:37.440000 - 0:20:38.360000::and your energy in,
0:20:38.360000 - 0:20:41.920000::because my energy in time is very, very valuable.
0:20:41.920000 - 0:20:45.480000::So when I take on a project, yeah,
0:20:45.480000 - 0:20:46.800000::I'm gonna put my all into it.
0:20:46.800000 - 0:20:50::If I wanted to make oranges my favorite food,
0:20:50 - 0:20:53.400000::of course, I would spend nine hours a day, you know,
0:20:53.400000 - 0:20:55.880000::hypnotizing myself with the maroon five songs
0:20:55.880000 - 0:20:57.480000::to make me associate positively
0:20:57.480000 - 0:20:58.600000::with the smell of oranges,
0:20:58.600000 - 0:21:00.320000::and then I'd lick an orange,
0:21:00.320000 - 0:21:02.440000::and then touch myself a little bit,
0:21:02.440000 - 0:21:04.160000::and then lick an orange, and then you know what I'm saying?
0:21:04.160000 - 0:21:05.320000::Trick my brain.
0:21:06.320000 - 0:21:07.480000::Of course, I could do that.
0:21:07.480000 - 0:21:09.840000::But is that the life I wanna live?
0:21:09.840000 - 0:21:11.720000::Is that where I wanna put my energy?
0:21:12.800000 - 0:21:13.640000::Life is easy.
0:21:13.640000 - 0:21:15.400000::You need to also, you need to be finishing this album
0:21:15.400000 - 0:21:17.800000::that you've been telling us about nonstop.
0:21:17.800000 - 0:21:19.120000::That's the first thing.
0:21:21.120000 - 0:21:23.080000::And the second thing is oranges.
0:21:23.080000 - 0:21:24.560000::Okay.
0:21:24.600000 - 0:21:26.840000::So, and now in Harry Potter,
0:21:26.840000 - 0:21:29.240000::there's three unforgivable curses, right?
0:21:29.240000 - 0:21:32.920000::Avada Kadabra, which is the death curse,
0:21:32.920000 - 0:21:35::that will kill you instantly,
0:21:35 - 0:21:37.920000::unless you are a special child
0:21:37.920000 - 0:21:41.200000::who's been made the final horcrux,
0:21:42.800000 - 0:21:44.920000::which is Harry Potter, no, not me, this boy,
0:21:44.920000 - 0:21:47.240000::but anyways, that will kill most.
0:21:47.240000 - 0:21:49.760000::The cruciatus curse, crucio.
0:21:49.760000 - 0:21:51.080000::Now, what is that?
0:21:51.080000 - 0:21:53.440000::Now, that is a torturous spell.
0:21:53.440000 - 0:21:55.320000::Now, why would you do that?
0:21:55.320000 - 0:21:58.120000::Well, maybe you're a dark wizard
0:21:58.120000 - 0:22:01.520000::who wants information about a location
0:22:01.520000 - 0:22:04.480000::of a mysterious child.
0:22:05.400000 - 0:22:07.320000::Then there's the imperious curse.
0:22:07.320000 - 0:22:10.520000::Now, this curse puts you under the spell
0:22:10.520000 - 0:22:12.760000::of someone else and you do their bidding.
0:22:12.760000 - 0:22:14.440000::Now, what would you use that for?
0:22:16.440000 - 0:22:17.280000::What does it do again?
0:22:17.280000 - 0:22:19.360000::I would assume evil.
0:22:19.360000 - 0:22:20.760000::Evil, right?
0:22:20.760000 - 0:22:22.080000::It's it.
0:22:22.080000 - 0:22:23.240000::Some sort of a room.
0:22:23.240000 - 0:22:26.600000::These are three things that I'm very afraid of, right?
0:22:26.600000 - 0:22:28.080000::But they're not real.
0:22:28.080000 - 0:22:30.320000::Yeah, not to you, because you didn't fall in love
0:22:30.320000 - 0:22:31.640000::with that world like I did.
0:22:33.320000 - 0:22:35.920000::But the reason I wanted to get to the Harry Potter world
0:22:35.920000 - 0:22:40.920000::is there is a mysterious creature called a boggurt.
0:22:41.800000 - 0:22:43.600000::Do you know what this is?
0:22:43.600000 - 0:22:45.640000::I'm very boggart.
0:22:45.640000 - 0:22:48.280000::It's from the Wizarding World of Harry Potter.
0:22:48.280000 - 0:22:50.040000::No, it's not him.
0:22:50.040000 - 0:22:53.400000::A boggurt is a creature that you know
0:22:53.400000 - 0:22:57.880000::how certain butterflies and mods will use there
0:22:58.840000 - 0:23:02.560000::whatever skin and body to look like a predator.
0:23:02.560000 - 0:23:06.600000::Like it looked like a owl or...
0:23:06.600000 - 0:23:08.240000::Now, the boggurt is no different.
0:23:08.240000 - 0:23:10.480000::It turns it shapes.
0:23:10.480000 - 0:23:12.520000::It figures out what you're the most afraid of
0:23:12.520000 - 0:23:15.200000::and it turns into that.
0:23:16.920000 - 0:23:17.760000::Okay.
0:23:17.760000 - 0:23:18.600000::Oh.
0:23:18.600000 - 0:23:19.560000::So now,
0:23:19.560000 - 0:23:21::Professor Lupen,
0:23:21 - 0:23:23.200000::Professor of Dark Arts.
0:23:23.200000 - 0:23:24.040000::Yeah.
0:23:24.040000 - 0:23:26.760000::He invites all the Harry Potter friends
0:23:26.760000 - 0:23:28.320000::and Harry Potter into a room and says,
0:23:28.320000 - 0:23:29.560000::we're taking this shit out.
0:23:30.520000 - 0:23:31.480000::And I'm gonna open this thing
0:23:31.480000 - 0:23:33.360000::and it's gonna be different for everybody else.
0:23:33.360000 - 0:23:37.360000::And so if you open that box and the boggurt came out,
0:23:37.360000 - 0:23:39.800000::what would it shape shift to in front of your eyes?
0:23:39.800000 - 0:23:41.200000::I wanna hear this from you guys.
0:23:44.520000 - 0:23:48.280000::A version of myself that was not
0:23:49.560000 - 0:23:51.600000::volunteering on a regular basis.
0:23:54.400000 - 0:23:55.440000::That sounds like a cop on it.
0:23:55.440000 - 0:23:56.280000::Just got chill.
0:23:56.280000 - 0:23:57.160000::Because I know you're probably gonna
0:23:57.160000 - 0:23:58.960000::frighten many things a lot of seafood.
0:24:02.800000 - 0:24:03.640000::Okay.
0:24:03.640000 - 0:24:05.240000::So that would be that for Nate.
0:24:05.240000 - 0:24:07.240000::Jack, what would be his orange?
0:24:07.240000 - 0:24:09.680000::No, probably my mom with a bunch of knives
0:24:09.680000 - 0:24:12.240000::and guns in her hands and I can't understand
0:24:12.240000 - 0:24:15.800000::why she hates me and wants to kill me all of a sudden.
0:24:15.800000 - 0:24:17::That would be terrifying.
0:24:17.960000 - 0:24:19.120000::Eric, what would yours be?
0:24:19.120000 - 0:24:23.960000::For me, it would be some giant, it would be death.
0:24:23.960000 - 0:24:25.920000::It's roast to death.
0:24:25.920000 - 0:24:27.520000::And what would that like?
0:24:27.520000 - 0:24:28.840000::What?
0:24:28.840000 - 0:24:30.200000::How did you roast me?
0:24:30.200000 - 0:24:33.400000::I said losing followers, but I apologize.
0:24:33.400000 - 0:24:35.920000::That's something I would have been afraid of years ago.
0:24:35.920000 - 0:24:36.760000::And now, right.
0:24:38 - 0:24:40.840000::So in traditional media that I don't care
0:24:40.840000 - 0:24:41.680000::about the online stuff.
0:24:41.680000 - 0:24:44.080000::Right. You see an end, yeah.
0:24:44.080000 - 0:24:45.240000::Right.
0:24:45.240000 - 0:24:46.680000::What is death the way we do?
0:24:46.680000 - 0:24:47.880000::The spectre of death.
0:24:47.960000 - 0:24:49.680000::What a death.
0:24:49.680000 - 0:24:51.520000::Dark could have reached you with a scythe.
0:24:53.120000 - 0:24:55.800000::And a white and white skin.
0:24:57.240000 - 0:25:00.040000::Yeah, pale death is very pale.

0:25:00 - 0:25:06.080000::Death is not getting any sun. Oh, this is death in my impression of death ready. I so pale
0:25:07.080000 - 0:25:08.080000::I
0:25:08.080000 - 0:25:10.080000::So pale
0:25:10.320000 - 0:25:13.400000::From the meme remember that I know I know
0:25:13.400000 - 0:25:18.080000::I'm so pale no blooper and then she realizes she's on air hilarious
0:25:19.160000 - 0:25:24.320000::Yeah, I know we need to do a full we need to get on the news. What the fuck are we doing?
0:25:25.720000 - 0:25:29.700000::Get on the local news. It's so easy. It's so easy to get on the news
0:25:30.040000 - 0:25:36.180000::Do you think it is if you get killed and go into a river well, yeah, yeah
0:25:37.280000 - 0:25:42.120000::I'm just saying like just like hey, we have the guys from joy tactics on it just
0:25:43.440000 - 0:25:45.720000::It's for no reason. There's nothing to promote
0:25:47.080000 - 0:25:51.920000::Yeah, I'm sure we could do it. You got a small enough market. You got Arkansas
0:25:52.800000 - 0:25:55.840000::Whatever what's the biggest town in Arkansas? Nobody knows
0:25:56.680000 - 0:26:01.680000::Lincoln, no, that's Nebraska. What if you put it there? Yeah, I don't think I can name one town
0:26:01.880000 - 0:26:04.680000::Fayette or something. Fayette Fayette, Fayetteville
0:26:05.320000 - 0:26:07.320000::That one Fayetteville, North Carolina
0:26:07.840000 - 0:26:13.200000::Okay, but let me tie that let me just tie this loop up on the boggard. How do you get rid of a boggard?
0:26:13.720000 - 0:26:19.200000::Right? You get really slice it down. No, it's scary. I'm fire. You just put salt on it
0:26:19.200000 - 0:26:21.200000::Like can we try and guess a little bit?
0:26:21.600000 - 0:26:24.560000::Okay, yeah, what else choke it out immediately?
0:26:24.560000 - 0:26:28.800000::Took it out not that I know about I don't think that'll work car accident
0:26:30.360000 - 0:26:36.560000::Maybe nut tap a bit of fat nut has that one big single giant fat nut
0:26:37.920000 - 0:26:41.600000::It's self-destructing nut buttons to find the red button on the back of the boggard
0:26:41.600000 - 0:26:44.120000::It's got a little red nut on the back on it back
0:26:44.600000 - 0:26:47.240000::Now what you do is you think of
0:26:47.240000 - 0:26:53.360000::what the fuck are these things called and I think this is how you get rid of the
0:26:53.360000 - 0:26:55.800000::Dementors actually but you think of this charm
0:26:56.440000 - 0:27:01.840000::If you patronus remember this do you guys read the books from my talking to a bunch of dead fish right now?
0:27:02.120000 - 0:27:04.400000::Because I'm getting no engagement for you guys on this
0:27:04.960000 - 0:27:08.480000::Well, sorry the the chairs person just texted me. Oh
0:27:09.120000 - 0:27:11.120000::Sure, that's a renting chairs from
0:27:12.120000 - 0:27:15.760000::Rending chairs for the show April 8th in Los Angeles a little sidebar
0:27:16.400000 - 0:27:21.520000::Eric no, I think frankly neither of us are very into Harry Potter
0:27:21.520000 - 0:27:24.760000::But we're having such a good time that it's not even a factor to be honest
0:27:25.240000 - 0:27:30.320000::Okay, I'll stop talking about it until the next episode, but thank you. Let's make mine
0:27:31.440000 - 0:27:33.440000::Yeah, what the fuck were we talking about?
0:27:33.440000 - 0:27:35.440000::I didn't even remember really
0:27:36 - 0:27:42::No, but how do you how do you cast a patronus you think of the most what a moment in your life?
0:27:42.360000 - 0:27:48.040000::So to combat the most scary thing you can think of you conjure and this is not magic
0:27:48.040000 - 0:27:52.680000::This is just humanity anybody can do this. You don't have to be a wizard or which you could even be a muggle
0:27:53.520000 - 0:27:58.040000::You conjure up a moment of pure joy and you say expect to put
0:27:58.280000 - 0:28:06.240000::Trondon and that bandit and then it shoots a fucking whatever your spirit animal out of your wand and it goes and takes the scary thing away
0:28:06.480000 - 0:28:11.840000::So if you guys had in a moment of pure fear Jack you're met with a giant orange
0:28:12.680000 - 0:28:14.680000::whatever monster Donald Trump
0:28:15.640000 - 0:28:21.160000::Nate you are face with some fucking put more even more pathetic version of yourself
0:28:21.760000 - 0:28:22.760000::for me
0:28:22.760000 - 0:28:24.040000::death
0:28:24.040000 - 0:28:27.960000::And we all have to think of joyful moments to to anchor us
0:28:28.960000 - 0:28:35.160000::And to get us out of that that horrible time. What what what would you guys think of what's a joyful moment that you could
0:28:36.120000 - 0:28:38.120000::remember
0:28:38.240000 - 0:28:42.360000::Wow, well, there's so many to pick from because we every week we
0:28:43.320000 - 0:28:50.040000::Right, that's this whole podcast the top whatever would be the top joyous moments. I'm sitting in my house
0:28:51.600000 - 0:28:54.520000::Completely normal day. I get a phone call
0:28:55.400000 - 0:28:58.360000::It's my managers. Oh, they say Jack
0:28:59.600000 - 0:29:03.760000::You know how you just went in and screen tested for Saturday night. I'll say yeah
0:29:05.160000 - 0:29:07.160000::I said guess what
0:29:07.160000 - 0:29:09.160000::They're huge fans
0:29:11.680000 - 0:29:13.680000::But
0:29:14.440000 - 0:29:21.080000::Yeah, there's no where there's no place for you in that world. I said you know what just hearing that they're huge fans
0:29:22.360000 - 0:29:29.520000::That made my fucking day that would make a expector it or whatever they're called a
0:29:30.040000 - 0:29:32.680000::Dementor a Huron what are they called?
0:29:32.680000 - 0:29:38.800000::Mm-hmm. I'm a ho-guard that would make them turn into basically
0:29:39.200000 - 0:29:45.640000::Mint jelly on the side of a lamp above I dip my fucking lamb in it and I'd suck them down
0:29:46.120000 - 0:29:54.320000::Straight in my mouth straight into my bicep use that shit wind it up and I'd punch all the fucking griffin door into a mother fucking black hole
0:29:57.520000 - 0:30:00.040000::Giant flaming fish I take out the

0:30:00 - 0:30:04.400000::the whole world once and for all. No, because Thanos enough is enough with that place.
0:30:04.400000 - 0:30:08.440000::Stop kidnapping British children and forcing them to be wizardry slaves. Let them live
0:30:08.440000 - 0:30:12.240000::their lives normally. Let them get addicted to crack and eat fucking chicken wings like
0:30:12.240000 - 0:30:17.760000::a normal human being. I don't wish Harry Potter world upon my worst enemies. That's why I
0:30:17.760000 - 0:30:22.040000::don't read the books. Does that answer your question? I read. I want to go there right now.
0:30:22.040000 - 0:30:27.240000::I'm going to go there right now. And by the way, we acknowledge the problematic author,
0:30:27.240000 - 0:30:30.480000::Jake Erroling. That's why it's so hard to engage.
0:30:30.480000 - 0:30:35.440000::Cry, which is quite honest. But I was one of the three scariest things in the Harry Potter
0:30:35.440000 - 0:30:46.920000::world. Well, to her, to a torture and not by the people in the Harry Potter world.
0:30:46.920000 - 0:30:51.600000::Can you imagine getting that fucking letter and owl? Who brings that shit right to your
0:30:51.600000 - 0:30:56.940000::door? Come to Hogwarts right now. Do you hear us over here now for four years of
0:30:56.940000 - 0:31:01.820000::fucking trickle desserts and corn on the cob and mashed potatoes and spells? And as many
0:31:01.820000 - 0:31:06.620000::books as you want to read and wand as well. I wouldn't want to go to school to that. I
0:31:06.620000 - 0:31:12.420000::forgot that owl is the way they communicate. That's right. Even though they don't have
0:31:12.420000 - 0:31:20.540000::the special education of I think hacks and peaches that shit. The school of wizardry
0:31:20.540000 - 0:31:30.420000::and also financial preparation for the real world after when you go back. Do you hear
0:31:30.420000 - 0:31:38.380000::about the owl in New York City? Was it Qlaco? So Flaco was released from the zoo of New
0:31:38.380000 - 0:31:46.780000::York legally by vendor. It's counter whatever. Bad people. They broke into the zoo. That
0:31:46.780000 - 0:31:53.780000::was the only thing that I can't tell you. I can't tell you what I'm talking about. Let
0:31:53.780000 - 0:32:00.780000::the owl out. Now the owl. Were the eco-terrorist? This was a statement or they were just fucking
0:32:00.780000 - 0:32:05.740000::bored? I don't know who's claimed it yet. I think there's a lot of presumptions geopolitically
0:32:05.740000 - 0:32:11.740000::about whether it was Iran or Pakistan or South America or Venezuela or again. Of course,
0:32:11.740000 - 0:32:17.780000::it's right. It died about a month ago. It's slammed to the side of a building. They found
0:32:17.780000 - 0:32:26.080000::its corpse now. Toxicology. Hold on. Hold on. There's one there's one owl in New
0:32:26.080000 - 0:32:31.340000::York City. Every city has an owl. And if you don't know what Los Angeles's owl is, then
0:32:31.340000 - 0:32:34.940000::you're not a fucking citizen. You shouldn't be able to. You're not an angel. You know,
0:32:34.940000 - 0:32:39.620000::you shouldn't be able to vote. That's right. So what's funny is, yes, there was an owl
0:32:39.620000 - 0:32:45.620000::that was released from the zoo. Building a crash into Salesforce. I don't. Well, I'm
0:32:45.620000 - 0:32:53.340000::not okay. Trade center one. Trying to do what it had. It's too small. But it did not
0:32:53.340000 - 0:32:58.140000::escape. It was released by criminals. It's okay. So it's flying around. They find its
0:32:58.140000 - 0:33:04.620000::corpse dead and alone. This is sad. And the toxicology report comes back. What do they
0:33:04.620000 - 0:33:11.420000::find out? This owl had pigeon herpes. I'm not joking. It had pigeon herpes. And it
0:33:11.420000 - 0:33:18.020000::had rat poison. It had pigeon herpes and rat poison in its system. Okay. So clearly
0:33:18.020000 - 0:33:24.980000::the life. So I had one crazy hangovered style night before I died. Or it binge for
0:33:24.980000 - 0:33:28.240000::that rat poison probably gets you all fucking high too in a good way. It probably feels
0:33:28.240000 - 0:33:36.200000::good at first. Like you're probably. Yeah. How in the hell did it get rat poison? Eating
0:33:36.200000 - 0:33:42.960000::rats from our blood? Is that? Yeah. The dumb question. What does rat poison come from?
0:33:42.960000 - 0:33:48.560000::It must come from a rat. What is it? Blood? The blood of a rat? Is it there? I think
0:33:48.560000 - 0:33:54.760000::a question. What is it? There's only two. You're wondering does rat poison come from rats?
0:33:54.760000 - 0:34:01.920000::Yeah. Where does human poison come from? All type of sources. It comes from plants. Mixing
0:34:01.920000 - 0:34:10.200000::different plants to get what? What's that? Metal. Metal. Metal. Metal. Metal. I think what
0:34:10.200000 - 0:34:14.120000::we all know we all know it's not from rats. It's from a chemical. It's like when you put a
0:34:14.120000 - 0:34:17.880000::rat poison in this rat box the rats go and eat it because I think it smells like Jimmy
0:34:17.880000 - 0:34:23.560000::John. But it's actually just poison and hide it hidden in the scent of ham. And then they
0:34:23.560000 - 0:34:28.980000::die and then you go and eat that rat and you consume the poison. You know who's still
0:34:28.980000 - 0:34:35.260000::rocking poison? Poisonings is the the Russians. They're oh my god. You thought poisonings
0:34:35.260000 - 0:34:43.400000::were of the middle ages and you know back in the ancient times they are still to this day
0:34:43.400000 - 0:34:48.840000::putting a little bit of hey look over there they drop a little bit of fucking you know
0:34:48.840000 - 0:34:54.800000::the draws. Yeah. In the undies. No, no. Listen, you know how they got that one guy. They
0:34:54.800000 - 0:34:59.920000::put a little fucking radioactive penny in this guy's underpants. It's drawers.

0:35:00 - 0:35:03.580000::Yeah, that's how they got that radioactive penny are you serious?
0:35:04.600000 - 0:35:06.680000::Creative shout out some Russians man
0:35:07.140000 - 0:35:10.680000::Doesn't take much and that shit gets funny is radio eight you

0:35:15.360000 - 0:35:17.360000::No, they know oh
0:35:18.400000 - 0:35:20.160000::Tony's chocolony

0:35:22.520000 - 0:35:28.800000::Read every single ingredient on that and Tommy that's why I'm eating only fucking one ingredient things
0:35:28.800000 - 0:35:30.800000::I'm eating only fruit

0:38:13.200000 - 0:38:20.560000::North Korea, you know whatever I have since been awakened to the crimes of the FBI in the CIA
0:38:20.560000 - 0:38:24.760000::And I know so much more about it than probably used to be so pro
0:38:25.520000 - 0:38:33.160000::But when I was a kid how many times have you guys looked up how to join the FBI because I I guarantee you I
0:38:33.840000 - 0:38:35.840000::Looked it up over 20 times in my life
0:38:36.760000 - 0:38:40.520000::Before I found my passion of improv and how come I yeah you went
0:38:41.200000 - 0:38:43.200000::It was
0:38:43.200000 - 0:38:45.200000::out you
0:38:45.200000 - 0:38:47.200000::You took improv classes
0:38:49.200000 - 0:38:53.520000::I would have joined that shit in a heartbeat the FBI
0:38:54.440000 - 0:38:57.440000::In 2019 I tried to become a drone operator
0:38:57.440000 - 0:39:04.640000::I sent that into the United States Army and I can't get them to stop emailing and texting me no matter what I do
0:39:04.640000 - 0:39:09.480000::I get a phone call who's gonna be hey? This is Jacob with the recruitment center out in Queens
0:39:10.360000 - 0:39:14.760000::Come on man, you signed up in 2019 did is that's a joke or
0:39:16.320000 - 0:39:18.320000::No as genuine curiosity
0:39:19.120000 - 0:39:27::You could okay, I know that we all know a drone operator. I can't say who I know don't say who but we know them do I know this person?
0:39:27 - 0:39:29::Yeah, you've met him
0:39:29.520000 - 0:39:33.960000::He does it remote but he's I mean, so he works he does it from his basement and
0:39:35.240000 - 0:39:38.200000::In Williamsburg, but he's fucking dropping shit all over
0:39:39.960000 - 0:39:44.120000::Hmm, hmm. He just he literally is sad controller
0:39:45.720000 - 0:39:47.720000::Sad I bet that there is like
0:39:49.840000 - 0:39:52.760000::Whatever mercenary drone opportunities
0:39:53.600000 - 0:40:00.040000::We're next we are next we are next up. I know I'm on the waiting list. You know there is a huge would you?

0:40:00 - 0:40:03.520000::like gold, gold, uh, what was that called?
0:40:03.520000 - 0:40:07.840000::Gold rush to create the new, I feel like this has been happening for a while.
0:40:07.840000 - 0:40:13.680000::The, the, basically the AI robot that you just kind of have in your house that you get to
0:40:13.680000 - 0:40:16.160000::like, fuck and just those chores for you and stuff.
0:40:16.720000 - 0:40:20.480000::But I feel like there is a gold rush right now to get, because I feel like the tech has
0:40:20.480000 - 0:40:26.160000::gotten like good enough where you can just implant this into a fucking robot.
0:40:26.160000 - 0:40:28.160000::And let's get it to the market immediately.
0:40:28.160000 - 0:40:31.600000::And who's gonna, who's gonna win this, this race?
0:40:31.600000 - 0:40:33.440000::Well, I signed an NDA.
0:40:33.440000 - 0:40:35.440000::So I hope no one fucking rats on me.
0:40:36.160000 - 0:40:41.200000::But I've been working with multiple of these tech companies, mostly Chinese,
0:40:41.200000 - 0:40:46.240000::that are working for a friendly five foot nine white guy to kind of, with the beard and the kind of
0:40:46.240000 - 0:40:50.880000::fucking, that type of smile to be in every household.
0:40:51.600000 - 0:40:52.560000::You're like the clown.
0:40:52.560000 - 0:40:54.320000::It's just gonna be me chilling in the corner.
0:40:54.640000 - 0:41:00.480000::The, the, and so, the, the, and so, the, and so, the battery powered so fucking hungry all the time.
0:41:00.480000 - 0:41:01.280000::So, so.
0:41:03.120000 - 0:41:04.320000::Wanting to sit down.
0:41:04.320000 - 0:41:06.400000::Well, you want it to be human, you know what I'm saying?
0:41:06.400000 - 0:41:07.760000::If it's too robot-
0:41:07.760000 - 0:41:08.560000::You definitely do.
0:41:08.560000 - 0:41:14::You, I feel like people are just gonna, you know, it's gonna be a cold entity in your house.
0:41:14 - 0:41:19.040000::So you need something that's a little bit annoying that's gonna piss you off sometimes.
0:41:19.040000 - 0:41:31.040000::and yeah, I feel like that'll be the trick for these tech people to code in human-like behaviors.
0:41:31.040000 - 0:41:33.040000::Right, so what do they need to code in?
0:41:33.040000 - 0:41:39.040000::I think they need to make them smell a little bit, you know, like at times.
0:41:39.040000 - 0:41:44.040000::Because I'll tell you right now, they're already going to be smelling like pennies out the fucking game.
0:41:44.040000 - 0:41:45.040000::Right, they need to smell like shit.
0:41:45.040000 - 0:41:50.040000::Like a couple times a day and he's be like, uh, yo, dude, get out.
0:41:50.040000 - 0:41:54.040000::Like, you went on my bath.
0:41:54.040000 - 0:41:58.040000::Oh shit, oh bathing a fucking robot.
0:41:58.040000 - 0:42:00.040000::That would be romantic, I think.
0:42:00.040000 - 0:42:01.040000::Careful.
0:42:01.040000 - 0:42:03.040000::Yeah, you've been fucking talking about that for a minute.
0:42:03.040000 - 0:42:06.040000::Don't act like that's not the first time you brought that shit up.
0:42:06.040000 - 0:42:10.040000::You're like scrubbing down here.
0:42:11.040000 - 0:42:15.040000::I bathe the robot a couple times a week really.
0:42:15.040000 - 0:42:16.040000::Who's that?
0:42:16.040000 - 0:42:17.040000::I get what way?

0:59:10.480000 - 0:59:13.760000::and get it all fucking wet and sloppy.
0:59:14.960000 - 0:59:17::And stab it and suck on that.
0:59:17 - 0:59:18.320000::And I bet you too.
0:59:18.320000 - 0:59:20.800000::Because what's on the other side of that?
