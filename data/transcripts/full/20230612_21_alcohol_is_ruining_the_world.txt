0:00:22.840000 - 0:00:27.880000::I can't, I don't think we can go very far in this episode without you.
0:00:27.880000 - 0:00:30.760000::Just owning up to what's going on with you right now.
0:00:30.760000 - 0:00:36.320000::And I think, I don't know if this probably won't come as a shock to anyone, but...
0:00:36.320000 - 0:00:38.320000::Yep.
0:00:38.320000 - 0:00:41.640000::You're in a different type of state right now, a different mental state.
0:00:41.640000 - 0:00:47.400000::I'm definitely in a mentally altered state that was exacerbated by a drug that has been
0:00:47.400000 - 0:00:53.600000::around for thousands of years and been human kinds best friend alcohol.
0:00:53.600000 - 0:00:59.840000::And they say not to drink too much, but last night I did.
0:00:59.840000 - 0:01:05.240000::I'm in Shaitown, Chicago Illinois, one of the best drinking cities, Frank Sinatra style,
0:01:05.240000 - 0:01:07.240000::drinking cities in the whole world.
0:01:07.240000 - 0:01:09.320000::And I fucking did it to myself last night.
0:01:09.320000 - 0:01:10.560000::I have no one else to blame.
0:01:10.560000 - 0:01:12.880000::It's on me guys.
0:01:12.880000 - 0:01:13.880000::I'm on OVA.
0:01:13.880000 - 0:01:15.600000::I'm a bit on OVA.
0:01:15.600000 - 0:01:18.720000::And listen, we're all going to be suffering the consequences.
0:01:18.720000 - 0:01:23.560000::Listeners, our flow of conversation and God knows what we're doing.
0:01:23.560000 - 0:01:25.280000::It knows what the ripple effects could be.
0:01:25.280000 - 0:01:32.040000::Butterfly effect style wise, this could fuck us in a way that we didn't sign up for, man.
0:01:32.040000 - 0:01:34.680000::So for you to go out and have who knows what you had.
0:01:34.680000 - 0:01:37.920000::A Sazarack, a Nagroni.
0:01:37.920000 - 0:01:41.600000::At that point, a beer, a Martini, did Martini with a twist?
0:01:41.600000 - 0:01:43.320000::Should we go through what I had?
0:01:43.320000 - 0:01:45.160000::I mean, do you think we should go through that?
0:01:45.160000 - 0:01:46.320000::I think you have to, man.
0:01:46.320000 - 0:01:48.360000::I think you have to be honest about this.
0:01:48.360000 - 0:01:51.560000::Well, I'm staying with my good friend, Jack, Felker.
0:01:51.560000 - 0:01:58.200000::And we have a pattern of going, having some big nights out where we kind of do bar crawls.
0:01:58.200000 - 0:01:59.720000::You know what I'm saying?
0:01:59.720000 - 0:02:01.120000::So here's how the night started.
0:02:01.120000 - 0:02:03.920000::I ended my day of working.
0:02:03.920000 - 0:02:04.920000::I came to her house.
0:02:04.920000 - 0:02:07.960000::We had a spin drift celtzer.
0:02:07.960000 - 0:02:08.960000::Spin drift celtzer.
0:02:08.960000 - 0:02:12.240000::Have you all had these before with alcohol in it?
0:02:12.240000 - 0:02:13.240000::What?
0:02:13.240000 - 0:02:15.800000::Yeah, they have spin drifts with liquor in them.
0:02:15.800000 - 0:02:16.800000::And guess what?
0:02:16.800000 - 0:02:17.800000::It's fucking good.
0:02:17.800000 - 0:02:19.280000::It looks healthy for you.
0:02:19.280000 - 0:02:21.960000::It tastes like it's almost healthy for you.
0:02:21.960000 - 0:02:22.960000::We know the truth.
0:02:22.960000 - 0:02:24.840000::We know it's poisoning us from within.
0:02:24.840000 - 0:02:26.080000::But it fucking tastes good.
0:02:26.080000 - 0:02:27.600000::I had the tangerine flavor.
0:02:27.600000 - 0:02:28.760000::Okay.
0:02:28.760000 - 0:02:30.080000::That's at about 6 p.m.
0:02:30.080000 - 0:02:31.080000::All right?
0:02:31.080000 - 0:02:33.120000::Then, what do we do?
0:02:33.120000 - 0:02:37.240000::We go to a restaurant called Lonesome Rose here in Logan Square, Chicago.
0:02:37.240000 - 0:02:38.560000::Chicago represent.
0:02:38.560000 - 0:02:40.840000::Stand up right now, Chicago.
0:02:40.840000 - 0:02:41.680000::And what did I have there?
0:02:41.680000 - 0:02:44.240000::I had a Medscal Margarita to start.
0:02:44.240000 - 0:02:45.240000::Okay.
0:02:45.240000 - 0:02:49.240000::Then I had, okay, that's our two.
0:02:49.280000 - 0:02:50.600000::I drank that slowly.
0:02:50.600000 - 0:02:55.160000::Then I had what they call a ranch water, which is just a tequila soda.
0:02:55.160000 - 0:02:56.720000::But this one, it's on tap.
0:02:56.720000 - 0:02:57.720000::It was a high ball.
0:02:57.720000 - 0:02:58.720000::Okay.
0:02:58.720000 - 0:03:01.040000::So the tequila is all infused with the celtzer.
0:03:01.040000 - 0:03:02.040000::It's a different taste.
0:03:02.040000 - 0:03:03.040000::I can't explain it.
0:03:03.040000 - 0:03:04.640000::Your taste buds will know the difference.
0:03:04.640000 - 0:03:05.640000::All right.
0:03:05.640000 - 0:03:07.640000::So that's drink three, right?
0:03:07.640000 - 0:03:10.880000::Then we went to a bar called Best Intentions.
0:03:10.880000 - 0:03:13.280000::I had a, they called it a tequila gimla.
0:03:13.280000 - 0:03:14.280000::I never heard of this.
0:03:14.280000 - 0:03:18.440000::This is just a blind juice and fucking tequila and a little sugar.
0:03:18.440000 - 0:03:19.440000::Okay.
0:03:19.440000 - 0:03:20.880000::That's drink four.
0:03:20.880000 - 0:03:21.880000::Is this interesting?
0:03:21.880000 - 0:03:25.160000::Man, let's just let them know when you hit the crack pipe, dude.
0:03:25.160000 - 0:03:27.760000::That's the best part of the story, dude.
0:03:27.760000 - 0:03:34.040000::No, I'm literally every drink when you say the next drink, I'm like, I like, it sends
0:03:34.040000 - 0:03:35.040000::chills down my spine.
0:03:35.040000 - 0:03:36.040000::You don't keep going.
0:03:36.040000 - 0:03:37.040000::Okay.
0:03:37.040000 - 0:03:38.040000::Then we went to a place called Parsons.
0:03:38.040000 - 0:03:39.040000::Oh my god.
0:03:39.040000 - 0:03:40.040000::It waits for you from Chicago.
0:03:40.040000 - 0:03:42.280000::You know, that's the most realest restaurant on the planet.
0:03:42.280000 - 0:03:45.280000::It's so sick to eat there and do drink there and spend your time there.
0:03:45.280000 - 0:03:46.280000::Johnny Parsons.
0:03:46.280000 - 0:03:47.920000::Johnny, no, it's just Parsons, dude.
0:03:47.920000 - 0:03:48.920000::There's five of them now, guys.
0:03:48.920000 - 0:03:49.920000::You know this?
0:03:49.920000 - 0:03:54.240000::This is maybe inside baseball for Chicago listeners, but there's five fucking Parsons.
0:03:54.240000 - 0:03:55.240000::What the hell?
0:03:55.240000 - 0:03:57.440000::Why do they need to franchise everything?
0:03:57.440000 - 0:04:04.560000::If you have a small business that takes off, like don't, I feel like these small businesses,
0:04:04.560000 - 0:04:06.320000::the success is going to their heads.
0:04:06.320000 - 0:04:07.320000::You know what I'm saying?
0:04:07.320000 - 0:04:08.320000::I know.
0:04:08.320000 - 0:04:13.240000::In some of these small, imagine if the first Wendy's ever never expanded and it was just,
0:04:13.240000 - 0:04:17.840000::it was just that one single place in Columbus, Ohio where I'm from, where the first
0:04:17.840000 - 0:04:22.360000::Wendy's is and it never became a crazy fast food restaurant.
0:04:22.360000 - 0:04:24.320000::That would be a staple of the city.
0:04:24.320000 - 0:04:28.920000::That would bring in people from all over the globe to check out the frosty, you know,
0:04:28.920000 - 0:04:30.320000::it would be so special.
0:04:30.320000 - 0:04:33.880000::And that's a success story, but let me put it to you this way.
0:04:33.880000 - 0:04:41.360000::Would you, you know, would you rather have a, basically a chain called Jimmy John, or
0:04:41.360000 - 0:04:46.400000::not Jimmy John's, quiz nose that is the most successful thing on the planet and you keep
0:04:46.400000 - 0:04:47.400000::it local?
0:04:47.400000 - 0:04:52.240000::Or would you rather step into the arena and find out that you can't quite fucking hang?
0:04:52.240000 - 0:04:54.320000::So that's the, that's a, that's a dangerous story.
0:04:54.320000 - 0:04:58.920000::You come and you try making a lobster, a biscuit toasted sandwich on a fucking croissant and
0:04:58.920000 - 0:04:59.920000::you get a boxed out.

0:05:00 - 0:05:03.440000::their only location is on the fucking Jersey turnpike.
0:05:03.440000 - 0:05:04.920000::Hahaha.
0:05:04.920000 - 0:05:05.920000::Loose us.
0:05:05.920000 - 0:05:06.980000::Quiz nose.
0:05:06.980000 - 0:05:08.480000::Quiz nose more like.
0:05:08.480000 - 0:05:09.720000::Psh. Psh.
0:05:09.720000 - 0:05:11.120000::Eric, can I ask you this?
0:05:11.120000 - 0:05:12.440000::What?
0:05:12.440000 - 0:05:16.440000::Was there any point last night where you were getting all
0:05:16.440000 - 0:05:21.560000::licked up, fucked up by your mind where you thought, hmm?
0:05:21.560000 - 0:05:23.560000::Maybe I shouldn't be doing this.
0:05:23.560000 - 0:05:27.600000::Maybe I should be taking it easy because tomorrow,
0:05:27.600000 - 0:05:29.400000::I have some responsibilities.
0:05:29.400000 - 0:05:30.400000::Yeah.
0:05:30.400000 - 0:05:31.400000::In my life.
0:05:31.400000 - 0:05:33.520000::And well, that's a good question.
0:05:33.520000 - 0:05:35.600000::You know, I, here's the thing.
0:05:35.600000 - 0:05:41.960000::I had over the course of about eight hours, maybe 10 drinks, nine drinks.
0:05:41.960000 - 0:05:42.960000::Okay.
0:05:42.960000 - 0:05:44.360000::That's, and that's drawn.
0:05:44.360000 - 0:05:45.600000::So I was filling it.
0:05:45.600000 - 0:05:47.400000::I wasn't like, tripping over myself.
0:05:47.400000 - 0:05:50.480000::By the end of the night, I was like, I'm feeling kind of drunk and I don't fucking like
0:05:50.480000 - 0:05:52.240000::this and get me out of here now.
0:05:52.240000 - 0:05:53.240000::Fucking rescue.
0:05:53.240000 - 0:05:55.960000::I would pay a million dollars to not be drunk and be in my life back right now because
0:05:55.960000 - 0:05:56.960000::I'm in the midst of it.
0:05:56.960000 - 0:05:57.960000::Hahaha.
0:05:57.960000 - 0:05:59.720000::I imagine.
0:05:59.720000 - 0:06:04.400000::But when I hit that, I'm not, you know, some people, they hit that drunk and then they
0:06:04.400000 - 0:06:06.040000::keep drink, you know what I mean?
0:06:06.040000 - 0:06:07.400000::They keep fucking pounding the shots.
0:06:07.400000 - 0:06:08.400000::Whatever.
0:06:08.400000 - 0:06:11.480000::I would say that's not me, but I am drinking too much.
0:06:11.480000 - 0:06:12.480000::You know what I'm saying?
0:06:12.480000 - 0:06:13.480000::Right.
0:06:13.480000 - 0:06:14.480000::Right.
0:06:14.480000 - 0:06:17.920000::So, you know, you can, whatever, but clearly I don't have a problem with whatever.
0:06:17.920000 - 0:06:24.440000::The other thing too, I'm walking around Chicago with the most busted haircut and sideburns
0:06:24.440000 - 0:06:25.880000::and shave of all time.
0:06:25.880000 - 0:06:27.720000::I feel like a child.
0:06:27.720000 - 0:06:31.840000::I feel like you guys remember that episode of The Simpsons where Michael Jackson plays
0:06:31.840000 - 0:06:36.440000::that escape to mental hospital patient that has an amazing voice.
0:06:36.440000 - 0:06:38.440000::No.
0:06:38.440000 - 0:06:45.680000::I don't want to give the capybara fucking militia more ammunition, but I feel like.
0:06:45.680000 - 0:06:48.680000::Hahaha.
0:06:48.680000 - 0:06:49.680000::They're already working.
0:06:49.680000 - 0:06:51.880000::They already came up with that one.
0:06:51.880000 - 0:06:53.880000::They said, yeah.
0:06:53.880000 - 0:06:54.880000::You are toast, dude.
0:06:54.880000 - 0:06:57.480000::This fucking, this episode do not look.
0:06:57.480000 - 0:07:02.880000::I can't even give any weight to this because I know people are, you know, just keep going
0:07:02.880000 - 0:07:03.880000::Eric.
0:07:03.880000 - 0:07:07.960000::Because what I'm about to say is, sir, sir, some weight, sir, sir, sir, something up.
0:07:07.960000 - 0:07:09.120000::Say it, say it, say it.
0:07:09.120000 - 0:07:10.120000::Uh oh.
0:07:10.120000 - 0:07:12.480000::No, I was going to say like, don't look in the comments, Eric.
0:07:12.480000 - 0:07:16.600000::So this is going to then, you know, then people are going to come out and say, oh, shit,
0:07:16.600000 - 0:07:21.960000::I'm going to get in the comments, you know, unless you can kind of play a mastermind
0:07:21.960000 - 0:07:26.680000::move right now and say it kind of at some point throughout the rest of the podcast, come
0:07:26.680000 - 0:07:31.120000::up with something else for the comments that's going to just trump anybody remembering to
0:07:31.120000 - 0:07:32.120000::do that.
0:07:32.120000 - 0:07:33.120000::Oh, yeah.
0:07:33.120000 - 0:07:35.360000::But people will comment while listening and then get to the point.
0:07:35.360000 - 0:07:37.760000::So you do kind of got to do right now.
0:07:37.760000 - 0:07:42.240000::Oh, I asked them to comment something specific.
0:07:42.240000 - 0:07:46.640000::Because right now the only comments, if this, if this podcast were so right now, the comments
0:07:46.640000 - 0:07:49.680000::would be just roasting your ass to high hell.
0:07:49.680000 - 0:07:54.720000::They would be telling you that you look like things that you never thought that was possible
0:07:54.720000 - 0:08:00.960000::and would just destroy your sense of self, your ego, your personal image, which is completely
0:08:00.960000 - 0:08:03.320000::shattered in a way that it's never been before.
0:08:03.320000 - 0:08:08.320000::Well, this is a tease, y'all, because they don't know what you look like.
0:08:08.320000 - 0:08:09.320000::You have a hat on.
0:08:09.320000 - 0:08:10.320000::You have had fun.
0:08:10.320000 - 0:08:14.120000::So they don't even know what even this fully clean, shape and fate.
0:08:14.120000 - 0:08:17.920000::I mean, maybe it's not shocking to you guys, but it's shocking to me.
0:08:17.920000 - 0:08:18.920000::Yeah.
0:08:18.920000 - 0:08:21.240000::It doesn't look like you kind of look like you have a little shadow right now.
0:08:21.240000 - 0:08:22.240000::You're far away from the camera.
0:08:22.240000 - 0:08:25.360000::It looks pretty, pretty normal to be honest with you.
0:08:25.360000 - 0:08:26.360000::Really?
0:08:26.360000 - 0:08:27.360000::Yeah.

0:08:33.640000 - 0:08:37.120000::And I have to keep this same style for the whole time.
0:08:37.120000 - 0:08:43.160000::And they have me in some clothing that I wear that I was like standing around, set,
0:08:43.160000 - 0:08:47.160000::like waiting to go, you know, how they were doing my scene, whatever, go do acting.
0:08:47.160000 - 0:08:50.640000::And people were coming up, like it looks, and we're in the middle of Illinois, wherever
0:08:50.640000 - 0:08:56.160000::filming in like office park with all these extended stay hotels around there.
0:08:56.160000 - 0:09:00.440000::And I just saw people looking at me like, this poor fucking bastard stuck in this little
0:09:00.440000 - 0:09:03.520000::town, you know what I mean?
0:09:03.520000 - 0:09:09.160000::Like I just, the fit makes me look real, a real person that is going through a bad fucking
0:09:09.160000 - 0:09:10.160000::time.

0:09:11.160000 - 0:09:12.160000::Yeah.
0:09:12.160000 - 0:09:15.160000::If you don't live in the cities, the big cities were pressing me down.
0:09:15.160000 - 0:09:16.160000::It's not even there.
0:09:16.160000 - 0:09:17.160000::It's more of just, oh, it is.
0:09:17.160000 - 0:09:19.200000::It's my fit, dude, because you blow a happy cell out there.
0:09:19.200000 - 0:09:24::But standing outside of the days and looking like that, you know what I mean?
0:09:24 - 0:09:30.240000::It looks like you're, I was just going to say you're so affected by your character, you
0:09:30.240000 - 0:09:31.240000::know?
0:09:31.240000 - 0:09:36.520000::I get, well, we talked about my passion for acting immensely on this podcast, but I go
0:09:36.520000 - 0:09:37.720000::fucking into it.

0:09:42.960000 - 0:09:43.960000::flipping a table over.
0:09:43.960000 - 0:09:44.960000::Yeah.
0:09:44.960000 - 0:09:46.960000::Even if it's a fucking priest.
0:09:46.960000 - 0:09:47.960000::Totally.
0:09:47.960000 - 0:09:53.800000::It's kind of like a baptism of the skin that you're wearing on a project.
0:09:53.800000 - 0:09:57.640000::One time I played a whole zero from holes in a play.
0:09:57.640000 - 0:10:00::And I remember this is my favorite fact about you.

0:10:00 - 0:10:04.740000::Yeah, I went to a special needs school for one year and seventh grade. They did the holes play
0:10:05.340000 - 0:10:07.340000::In a production full
0:10:07.340000 - 0:10:12.480000::Whose holes put we did a production of holes an adaptation in a carpeted room

0:10:18.720000 - 0:10:22.860000::Yeah, and I played zero and which one was zero
0:10:23.880000 - 0:10:27.920000::Zero was the quiet one that didn't have to talk until the end
0:10:28.680000 - 0:10:30.680000::Yeah, so you don't have any lines
0:10:31.640000 - 0:10:35.920000::Well, what did Leonardo Capra get the get the Oscar for the
0:10:36.920000 - 0:10:43.440000::Quiet movie over the Revenant. Yep, sometimes the best thing you'll ever say is the least words you've ever said
0:10:47.120000 - 0:10:54.040000::Yeah, holes was fucking next level shot at the mr. Lebuff that book I read
0:10:55 - 0:10:59.500000::Twice I read that like you know for school and then I read it again
0:10:59.500000 - 0:11:07.300000::And that is I'm a person never reads anything twice or I don't like watching things twice either
0:11:07.300000 - 0:11:12::I like watching it one time and then just having that experience be my first
0:11:12.440000 - 0:11:15.360000::Amazing shocking experience for it and then just put it away
0:11:15.360000 - 0:11:20.280000::You don't even like to look at a person twice. You don't even like to remit you right? Yeah, yeah, right
0:11:20.280000 - 0:11:25.560000::This is painful doing this every week to see you guys because I have to see you more than once, but right
0:11:26.760000 - 0:11:32::Holes just some about it just did it for me. So let's break down the plot. I mean, let's do a quick
0:11:32.840000 - 0:11:39.440000::Book report on this all right, so Shilobuff is calling stealing gum or something. I can't remember and he's got to go to

0:11:59.520000 - 0:12:04.280000::I wonder if he's in the dirt yet, you know, I wonder if you get a choice when you're a serial killer
0:12:04.280000 - 0:12:08.080000::All right, he's not a serial killer, but a crazy bomber. Yeah, they probably dip him in
0:12:09.360000 - 0:12:12.040000::Fucking ass. You still die from firing squad
0:12:12.800000 - 0:12:14.800000::I

0:37:31.560000 - 0:37:36.760000::the new series. There ain't no lightsabers in that. That's a political drama. And guess
