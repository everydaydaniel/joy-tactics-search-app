0:05:34.920000 - 0:05:41.940000::the Hollywood bus comes by you're you're out getting your mail and you happen to you know they
0:05:41.940000 - 0:05:46.440000::happen to see what's your move are you going back inside are you coming out are you waving are
0:05:46.440000 - 0:05:52.560000::you gonna stop while the the the the person on the bus is oh my god we have a we have a special
0:05:52.560000 - 0:05:57.760000::guest here this never happens and you come on the bus and fucking drink with them and go take
0:05:57.760000 - 0:06:03.400000::the neighborhood here's what you do because they just passed Toby McGuire's house he fucking
0:06:03.400000 - 0:06:07.160000::shot at them whatever he hit all these Lebanese hate people that paid the money.
0:06:07.160000 - 0:06:15.120000::I'm right. Papa. Sideways pistol. Right. But I think all three of us would recognize these
0:06:15.120000 - 0:06:19.720000::fans that are coming to check out my house and invade my privacy are the same people who paid
0:06:19.720000 - 0:06:24.840000::for this shit. So actually they own this house as well. So here's what I do come out with a
0:06:24.840000 - 0:06:33.160000::tray of fucking uh slider. Jello shots. Yeah and sliders sit down with them break bread
0:06:33.160000 - 0:06:39.120000::ask them what I could do better in my movies and TV shows. Mm-hmm. I'm like so washed up at this
0:06:39.120000 - 0:06:46.120000::point. Well here's how you take it to the next level you how Jack don't ever let this scenario
0:06:46.120000 - 0:06:51.680000::even begin in the first place. If you're a celebrity if you're a public figure and you've built
0:06:51.680000 - 0:06:56.920000::your life on the backs of regular people you need to be on that you need to live on that bus
0:06:56.920000 - 0:07:03.120000::yourself and you get paraded around all the nice working class neighborhoods and they just get to
0:07:03.120000 - 0:07:08.360000::come out every morning like newspaper like you basically need to be the newspaper person they go oh
0:07:08.360000 - 0:07:11.840000::there's everybody there they all go. You know I'm saying don't even let it get to that point if it's
0:07:11.840000 - 0:07:16.600000::at the point where they're having to get on a bus to come see you when they created you. Yeah you're
0:07:16.600000 - 0:07:23::already messing up. You're washed. It's over. You're washed and you're fucking making me mad. Selfish
0:07:23 - 0:07:28.360000::bro that's self selfish behaviors. I feel like that could be a good like if you're if you're like
0:07:28.360000 - 0:07:35.240000::feeling if you're like in a Ben Affleck mode just kind of like really really down and out don't
0:07:35.240000 - 0:07:39.800000::you feel like that would be like a good ego boost. If you just kind of waited by just the story
0:07:39.800000 - 0:07:44.760000::and just waited for a bunch of people to be shocked to see you. Like those are the people that are like
0:07:45.320000 - 0:07:51.880000::in an LA people don't give a fucking shit if you're a celebrity like you'll you'll see some really
0:07:51.880000 - 0:07:57.720000::famous person just walking around shopping nobody nobody's really doing anything to taking
0:07:57.720000 - 0:08:03.880000::pictures of them. Well I am of course but discreetly. I'm pretty much the only person who cares it
0:08:03.880000 - 0:08:09.720000::seems but these are the people who ship themselves in from fucking Wisconsin and they are shocked to
0:08:09.720000 - 0:08:16.280000::see literally ship themselves in an adidas box and that must feel good to have somebody to have
0:08:16.280000 - 0:08:23.480000::a bus full of people care about you when no one else in the world. Wow a caring bus. A caring bus
0:08:23.480000 - 0:08:31.080000::that's what that is. I'm just saying there's some dark times ahead for I know all three of us.
0:08:31.640000 - 0:08:36.840000::Imagine this night time. Imagine this night time tour. I'd like to sell this idea. Night time
0:08:36.840000 - 0:08:44.200000::tours of the Hollywood Hills and every celebrity is set set out front in their driveway. They have a
0:08:44.200000 - 0:08:51.160000::smokeless fire pit. They're sitting by fire. There's as much of chairs around. They have drinks hot
0:08:51.160000 - 0:08:57.720000::chocolate whatever everybody can come and sit do a fireside chat with the celebrities. You know
0:08:57.720000 - 0:09:01.720000::I'm saying yeah and then they tell stories of movies tell stories of what it was like to work on
0:09:01.720000 - 0:09:07.400000::and born identity tell stories about what it was like to make your first break in Hollywood which is
0:09:07.400000 - 0:09:12.440000::the hardest that by the way that's the hardest part and actually the real hardest part isn't I
0:09:12.440000 - 0:09:16.680000::want to tell everybody listening to this that's aspiring to be in Hollywood the hardest part is
0:09:16.680000 - 0:09:23.560000::not your first break the hardest part is that second job okay get that because that because
0:09:23.560000 - 0:09:33.080000::yeah that's because the first one could be a fluke you know what that's how you guys I got
0:09:33.080000 - 0:09:40.280000::picked up from work the other day by Uber driver and he was talking to me and I was like what did
0:09:40.280000 - 0:09:45.480000::you do today he's like I was just doing stand-up all day I said excuse me because this you know
0:09:45.480000 - 0:09:52.520000::all day and apparently there are places in LA this is so if you're doing this and it's working
0:09:52.520000 - 0:09:57.240000::congratulations good for you but to me it sounded a little a little sad and predatory but you can
0:09:57.240000 - 0:09:59.960000::go rent like a black box you pay $10

0:10:00 - 0:10:06::like 11 a.m. to go to this like little black box theater with other standups and just do an open

0:10:16.960000 - 0:10:22.320000::I never heard of that. That's inspiring. Routine. Yeah. That's a seem predatory. It seems like
0:10:22.320000 - 0:10:30.960000::what we need to be doing right 11 a.m. open mic. That's right. Shout out to all the
0:10:30.960000 - 0:10:36::fucking Uber drivers out there. The creative Uber drivers because I know they're cooking up

0:14:39.680000 - 0:14:46.880000::Trump tried to dodge a wrench. Trump dodged a wrench. Can we just say this right now? Joy tactics. Joy tactics in no
0:14:46.880000 - 0:14:53.840000::way shape or form endorses political bonds unless it's World War II individually. Some of us do but
0:14:53.840000 - 0:14:57.840000::I know we won't say here. Well there's a difference between endorsing it and wanting it to happen.
0:14:57.840000 - 0:14:59.840000::That's right. That's a hundred percent.

0:15:00 - 0:15:05.280000::However, what just happened many
0:15:05.280000 - 0:15:06.480000::and exquisite.
0:15:06.480000 - 0:15:07.480000::Exquisite.
0:15:07.480000 - 0:15:13.920000::So if you're met, let's just imagine that these are a bunch of three year olds on the
0:15:13.920000 - 0:15:14.920000::playground.
0:15:14.920000 - 0:15:19.200000::If you're a teacher and you're on and you go out to the playground and you see, oh, everybody's
0:15:19.200000 - 0:15:24::flocking around one of them who's giving a really impassioned speech politically.
0:15:24 - 0:15:26.920000::And then you see another three year old who's up on the monkey bars with this night
0:15:26.920000 - 0:15:28.920000::but rifle.
0:15:28.920000 - 0:15:36.040000::You know, you would tell them like, this is very obviously poor behavior.
0:15:36.040000 - 0:15:42.840000::And yet when adults do it, why are we not, you know, intervening?
0:15:42.840000 - 0:15:43.840000::Interesting.
0:15:43.840000 - 0:15:44.840000::Right.
0:15:44.840000 - 0:15:47.080000::That's a great point.
0:15:47.080000 - 0:15:53.600000::You now are getting into sort of the conspiracies that are floating around, which I'd like to sort
0:15:53.600000 - 0:15:54.600000::to dive into.
0:15:54.600000 - 0:15:59.080000::Well, I've been purposefully not because I like to come up with my own conspiracy for these
0:15:59.080000 - 0:16:00.080000::type of things.
0:16:00.080000 - 0:16:04::I don't want to be influenced by anybody else's mind tricks.
0:16:04 - 0:16:08.080000::So I haven't been looking at the forums, but you know, I think immediately hopped on the
0:16:08.080000 - 0:16:09.080000::forum.
0:16:09.080000 - 0:16:10.240000::I have to know.
0:16:10.240000 - 0:16:12.440000::So what's the probability?
0:16:12.440000 - 0:16:20.360000::What do you, what do you guys think was this planned by the Trump campaign?
0:16:20.360000 - 0:16:22.280000::Because I don't know.
0:16:22.280000 - 0:16:26.960000::They were wondering because Biden seems to like them hoof by the hoof.
0:16:26.960000 - 0:16:28.760000::The reaction is, oh shit.
0:16:28.760000 - 0:16:31.520000::I guess Trump's going to be president now.
0:16:31.520000 - 0:16:33.320000::This was the final nail in the coffin.
0:16:33.320000 - 0:16:40.560000::You know, every, every election, it's 51, 50, 52, you know, it's right down the middle.
0:16:40.560000 - 0:16:41.560000::They barely win.
0:16:41.560000 - 0:16:46.520000::And I feel like the Trump campaign was like, what do we got to do to make this a guarantee
0:16:46.520000 - 0:16:48.320000::to win in 2024?
0:16:48.320000 - 0:16:50.840000::Biden's got a one.
0:16:50.840000 - 0:16:55.440000::Biden has to one up this dude now and fall off the motherfucking I full tower.
0:16:55.440000 - 0:17:00.080000::If he falls off the I full tower, everyone, no one's been a fucking no one's your member
0:17:00.080000 - 0:17:01.560000::or give it a fuck about his role.
0:17:01.560000 - 0:17:03.040000::He has to do some crazy.
0:17:03.040000 - 0:17:04.240000::He has to get fucked up.
0:17:04.240000 - 0:17:05.240000::He has to.
0:17:05.240000 - 0:17:08.400000::He has to do like, he's got to get ragged all by a bowl.
0:17:08.400000 - 0:17:10.400000::He's got to go fuck you.
0:17:10.400000 - 0:17:13.720000::A seven 20 out of a plane on a snowboard.
0:17:13.720000 - 0:17:14.720000::Well, he's got to get fucked up.
0:17:14.720000 - 0:17:16.400000::He needs sympathy.
0:17:16.400000 - 0:17:19.400000::You know, he needs to get like stuck under a car.
0:17:20.120000 - 0:17:27::Or if you did like red hole mountain bike challenges, were they go to my helicopter?
0:17:27 - 0:17:28::Yeah.
0:17:28 - 0:17:29::Yeah.
0:17:29 - 0:17:32.320000::He's like grunting the whole time.
0:17:32.320000 - 0:17:34.240000::Yeah, because Trump has everything now.
0:17:34.240000 - 0:17:35.760000::Trump has sympathy.
0:17:35.760000 - 0:17:38.640000::He has not my sympathy, obviously.
0:17:38.640000 - 0:17:40.800000::Of course, I see stuff like that every day.
0:17:40.800000 - 0:17:42.040000::Crazy stuff and that.
0:17:42.040000 - 0:17:43.040000::The call.
0:17:43.040000 - 0:17:44.040000::What's that?
0:17:44.040000 - 0:17:46.880000::What did I call it in a stasenation versus a murder?
0:17:46.880000 - 0:17:47.880000::Murder.
0:17:47.880000 - 0:17:48.880000::Right?
0:17:48.880000 - 0:17:49.880000::Is it a murder?
0:17:49.880000 - 0:17:51.600000::No, they can't.
0:17:51.600000 - 0:17:57.400000::You need public figure status to be assassinated or it's a privileged.
0:17:57.400000 - 0:17:59.200000::It's a privilege to ask.
0:17:59.200000 - 0:18:00.520000::Why did they put that in there?
0:18:00.520000 - 0:18:01.520000::Ask.
0:18:01.520000 - 0:18:02.520000::Okay.

0:24:39.860000 - 0:24:41.860000::taught me about
0:24:41.860000 - 0:24:43.620000::you know
0:24:43.620000 - 0:24:47.820000::Bad brains cool bands dude check this out
0:24:50.380000 - 0:24:52.380000::Yeah, don't speak just listen
0:24:54.180000 - 0:24:59.540000::What's that mean why is Jeremy coming to me in my dreams and he was so grounded by the way really

0:25:00 - 0:25:03::Well, dude, you know he's looking for the next project.
0:25:03.500000 - 0:25:07.200000::Really wants to work with someone he's worked with before.
0:25:07.800000 - 0:25:13::And he's looking to do something psychosexual or not a psychosexual psychedelic.
0:25:13 - 0:25:14.320000::Sepio sexual.
0:25:14.320000 - 0:25:15.960000::Sepio sexual.
0:25:16.160000 - 0:25:18.160000::Well, interesting.
0:25:18.160000 - 0:25:21.720000::No one's seen a Sepio sexual romance yet on screen.
0:25:22.240000 - 0:25:22.840000::Not there.
0:25:22.840000 - 0:25:23.360000::Whereup?
0:25:23.560000 - 0:25:24.240000::Not there.
0:25:24.240000 - 0:25:27.320000::But then you go back and you watch up in the air and you realize.
0:25:27.440000 - 0:25:27.960000::Right.
0:25:27.960000 - 0:25:30.720000::That why were they so intellectual interest right there?
0:25:31.720000 - 0:25:32.400000::And then you watch.
0:25:32.400000 - 0:25:34.200000::Clooney has that swag.
0:25:34.480000 - 0:25:39.960000::Georgina Clooney, he called for Biden to to step to do political.
0:25:39.960000 - 0:25:41.440000::So he called it.
0:25:41.960000 - 0:25:43.120000::So Puku, that's right.
0:25:44.400000 - 0:25:44.880000::Yeah.
0:25:44.880000 - 0:25:45.800000::How do you do that?
0:25:45.800000 - 0:25:46.400000::Mr. Clooney?
0:25:46.400000 - 0:25:49.720000::No, as you step your ass up, why don't we have his ass as president?
0:25:49.720000 - 0:25:50.360000::Yeah, George.
0:25:50.360000 - 0:25:51.360000::We need to clean the key.
0:25:51.360000 - 0:25:52.280000::It needs to step in.
0:25:52.440000 - 0:25:52.960000::Right.
0:25:53.160000 - 0:25:53.760000::What?
0:25:54.080000 - 0:25:57.280000::Listen, if you two, if either of you two are ever.
0:25:58.960000 - 0:26:04.120000::Just undeniably like inoperable your whole body shut down.
0:26:05.120000 - 0:26:06.200000::I don't give a hell.
0:26:06.400000 - 0:26:10.360000::I'm going to continue rocking with y'all, continue promoting the brand.
0:26:10.560000 - 0:26:12.080000::Because we're all on the same team.
0:26:12.480000 - 0:26:13.440000::There is nothing.
0:26:13.440000 - 0:26:17.800000::Joe Biden could rip my fucking throat out and eat it like a slim gym.
0:26:18 - 0:26:20.040000::And I'd say, you know what?
0:26:22.240000 - 0:26:23.960000::That's how that's what I like.
0:26:24.440000 - 0:26:25.760000::Yeah, all good, man.
0:26:25.760000 - 0:26:27.920000::So George Clooney's got the wrong idea.
0:26:27.920000 - 0:26:29.280000::He doesn't know a thing about loyalty.
0:26:29.280000 - 0:26:30.560000::He doesn't know a thing about allegiance.
0:26:30.560000 - 0:26:31.440000::And he's a coward.
0:26:32 - 0:26:32.800000::He's a coward.
0:26:33.120000 - 0:26:37.200000::He's a coward who just so happens to make amazing movies has the most charm out of anyone.
0:26:37.200000 - 0:26:38.240000::I've ever seen on screen.
0:26:38.240000 - 0:26:39.560000::I could watch him for years.
0:26:39.760000 - 0:26:43.120000::There's not one movie he's made where I've turned it off, except for the recent ones.
0:26:45.200000 - 0:26:48.840000::And you're creating something business owner.
0:26:49.520000 - 0:26:51.200000::Cosmega, of course,
0:26:51.200000 - 0:26:52.800000::to keep the whole thing.
0:26:52.800000 - 0:26:53.920000::Cosmega's mean.
0:26:54.560000 - 0:26:56.480000::Oh, Jack, don't play.
0:26:56.480000 - 0:26:57.920000::You were at my birthday last year.
0:26:59.280000 - 0:27:00.720000::It was Cosmega's theme.
0:27:00.720000 - 0:27:03.840000::Cippen, the Cosmega's theme, we all dress like Clooney from our show.
0:27:03.840000 - 0:27:07.360000::We didn't drink any of it, but we made our own labels.
0:27:08.560000 - 0:27:10.680000::No, no, but for real, there's additives in that shit.
0:27:10.680000 - 0:27:13.240000::If you want Peer to Kila, don't do Cosmega's.
0:27:13.240000 - 0:27:16.880000::There's added tips really up in that piece.
0:27:16.920000 - 0:27:18.080000::Additionalization.
0:27:18.720000 - 0:27:23.040000::There's a big problem in this world with two with the lack of
0:27:24.720000 - 0:27:27.040000::are we not habituating enough?
0:27:27.040000 - 0:27:27.840000::Is that the problem?
0:27:27.840000 - 0:27:29.520000::It's a good interesting point to raise.
0:27:29.520000 - 0:27:30.480000::Is that the whole problem?
0:27:30.480000 - 0:27:32.240000::And what do you mean by that?
0:27:32.240000 - 0:27:34.080000::What I mean is we're not habituating.
0:27:34.080000 - 0:27:36.800000::And so we're just acting completely recklessly.
0:27:36.800000 - 0:27:40::We're not practicing positive behavior patterns.
0:27:41.440000 - 0:27:42.800000::We want society to.
0:27:42.800000 - 0:27:44.800000::Most definitely act normal.
0:27:45.360000 - 0:27:48.240000::You know the evolutionary, you know how we went from,
0:27:49.120000 - 0:27:51.200000::this is a bingo card markup, but we went from
0:27:51.760000 - 0:27:53.120000::homo- demain,
0:27:53.120000 - 0:27:56.340000::corrector, astral apickittS
0:27:57.060000 - 0:27:59.520000::and it goes up through Nandithal
0:27:59.520000 - 0:28:02.320000::and then it gets to us, the homo sapiens.
0:28:05.520000 - 0:28:10.400000::Then the next one is homo-addicted to phones.
0:28:10.480000 - 0:28:13.480000::Let's homo sapio while satiotics,
0:28:13.480000 - 0:28:15.360000::a assignment's overlooking at their phones.
0:28:15.760000 - 0:28:18.680000::We need something that's going to get people to look up again.
0:28:19.040000 - 0:28:19.880000::Get that.
0:28:19.880000 - 0:28:23.240000::know, back all straight and a phone that goes above your head.
0:28:24.320000 - 0:28:27.760000::Something to just snap people because we're desensitized to all this
0:28:27.760000 - 0:28:31.840000::but we see it on our phone next it's someone dance doing the apple dance to
0:28:31.840000 - 0:28:35.240000::Charlie Xe X and that's what we care about more than the ex president getting
0:28:35.240000 - 0:28:41.440000::raised by a long will it? It's simple. The truth is, nothing can ever
0:28:41.920000 - 0:28:46.720000::replace what the undeniable human sensory experiences and emotional
0:28:46.720000 - 0:28:52.160000::experiences. So hearing about something happening, you could have the best
0:28:52.160000 - 0:28:57.240000::VR scenario in the world, but our brains are programmed to know the truth.
0:28:58.400000 - 0:29:04.280000::Okay. And when we see these things, when we see Trump getting frickin'
0:29:04.640000 - 0:29:09.080000::soccer ball kicked in the ear by a bullet, we don't care because we know that
0:29:09.120000 - 0:29:13.640000::there's something untruthful about this. It's not real. It's not real.
0:29:14.600000 - 0:29:20.960000::And what do you guys think? Was it was it was it was it glass or was it a bullet?
0:29:21.200000 - 0:29:26.520000::Because we were we're seeing that at first they were like, oh, they shot the teleprompter.
0:29:26.640000 - 0:29:32.840000::Maybe they just really wanted him to go off script because they like it when he does that, you know, he was too on
0:29:33.600000 - 0:29:37.400000::on prompt. Well, based on the bullet wounds I've seen.
0:29:38.400000 - 0:29:44.680000::There's no entry point in his ear. You can see it. It just looks like something is gray, you know, but the
0:29:44.680000 - 0:29:51.080000::gray's, you know, from a physics standpoint, that gray's would go slice across the
0:29:51.080000 - 0:29:55.120000::whole of the year, right? It looks like some shard hit him.
0:29:55.120000 - 0:29:59.920000::Shrapnel. Maybe yeah, strap glass shrapnel as we all know. So that's an
0:29:59.920000 - 0:30:00.920000::interesting thing.

0:30:00 - 0:30:03::interesting point you raised, and I haven't considered that yet.
0:30:03 - 0:30:11.200000::I am curious about the physics of it, because for something to hit you in the ear, you'd
0:30:11.200000 - 0:30:16.840000::have to be directly beneath them, right?
0:30:16.840000 - 0:30:21.680000::Because if you were anywhere else, it would go through your whole head.
0:30:21.680000 - 0:30:24.040000::How to kind of only hit your ear.
0:30:24.040000 - 0:30:25.200000::Right.
0:30:25.200000 - 0:30:27.600000::And I think it was behind the ear, right?
0:30:27.600000 - 0:30:29::So it came from the back of his foot.
0:30:29 - 0:30:32::So it was like, he was...
0:30:32 - 0:30:33.440000::And here's the thing.
0:30:33.440000 - 0:30:37.560000::If you shoot a 50-cal, you guys not 50-cal is our right course.
0:30:37.560000 - 0:30:38.560000::Mm-hmm.
0:30:38.560000 - 0:30:40.160000::Have we talked about this yet?
0:30:40.160000 - 0:30:41.840000::Maybe you told me this Nate.
0:30:41.840000 - 0:30:46.200000::That if you're even, I think you did tell me this Nate, if you, that bullet has such a
0:30:46.200000 - 0:30:50.600000::high velocity that even if it doesn't hit you and just goes past you, it'll still rip
0:30:50.600000 - 0:30:51.600000::a little bit.
0:30:51.600000 - 0:30:52.600000::It looks bloated.
0:30:52.600000 - 0:30:53.600000::You know what I'm saying?
0:30:53.600000 - 0:30:56.440000::The force field around it will...
0:30:56.440000 - 0:30:57.440000::Right.
0:30:57.440000 - 0:30:58.440000::That's right.
0:30:58.680000 - 0:31:02.840000::So I don't even know if his ass got shot.
0:31:02.840000 - 0:31:06.760000::What kind of bullets was this guy using?
0:31:06.760000 - 0:31:07.600000::Were they even bullets?
0:31:07.600000 - 0:31:08.840000::I saw a picture of it.
0:31:08.840000 - 0:31:10.640000::I saw somebody snapt a photo of the bullet.
0:31:10.640000 - 0:31:11.640000::And that thing's long.
0:31:11.640000 - 0:31:15.840000::Long, that thing looks like what I have dreams is stuck in my skin.
0:31:15.840000 - 0:31:21.840000::And where do you get the bullet from a vending machine?
0:31:21.840000 - 0:31:23.480000::Have you seen these?
0:31:23.480000 - 0:31:26.080000::No, dude, but that is dystopic for sure.
0:31:26.080000 - 0:31:30.880000::Are they just dropped them in the US?
0:31:30.880000 - 0:31:31.880000::Bully?
0:31:31.880000 - 0:31:32.880000::Bully?
0:31:32.880000 - 0:31:33.880000::Bully?
0:31:33.880000 - 0:31:34.880000::Bully?
0:31:34.880000 - 0:31:35.880000::Bully?
0:31:35.880000 - 0:31:36.880000::IdiocreCyMuch?
0:31:36.880000 - 0:31:37.880000::IdiocreCyMuch?
0:31:37.880000 - 0:31:38.880000::Yeah.
0:31:38.880000 - 0:31:39.880000::We should re-puttin' books in them things instead.
0:31:39.880000 - 0:31:42.880000::People are living so unrelistically.
0:31:42.880000 - 0:31:43.880000::Right.
0:31:43.880000 - 0:31:44.880000::If there was a book vending machine?
0:31:44.880000 - 0:31:48.880000::Yeah, people start reading again.
0:31:48.880000 - 0:31:49.880000::Medicine, medical vending machine.
0:31:49.880000 - 0:31:51.880000::Redbox just went out of business.
0:31:51.880000 - 0:31:54.880000::Why don't we replace them with...
0:31:54.880000 - 0:31:55.880000::Redbox?
0:31:55.880000 - 0:31:56.880000::Redbox.
0:31:56.880000 - 0:31:57.880000::Redbox.
0:31:57.880000 - 0:31:58.880000::Red the books.
0:31:58.880000 - 0:32:01.880000::And then drop them off when you return.
0:32:01.880000 - 0:32:03.880000::Live, read about that.
0:32:03.880000 - 0:32:04.880000::You read about that?
0:32:04.880000 - 0:32:05.880000::Live, read.
0:32:05.880000 - 0:32:08.880000::I was thinking about this.
0:32:08.880000 - 0:32:11.880000::What happened to the Benjamin Franklin type guys?
0:32:11.880000 - 0:32:13.880000::You know, they really looked like those people.
0:32:13.880000 - 0:32:14.880000::They didn't make them like that.
0:32:14.880000 - 0:32:15.880000::No, no, no.
0:32:15.880000 - 0:32:16.880000::They don't.
0:32:16.880000 - 0:32:17.880000::The intellectual fucking...
0:32:17.880000 - 0:32:20.880000::Kind of a chalubby guy who's just always kind of like...
0:32:20.880000 - 0:32:22.880000::You know what they call those experiments?
0:32:23.880000 - 0:32:25.880000::The intellectual political CADs.
0:32:25.880000 - 0:32:26.880000::CADs.
0:32:26.880000 - 0:32:27.880000::Well, CADs.
0:32:27.880000 - 0:32:34.880000::That is sort of words that they would use for, I guess you would say,
0:32:34.880000 - 0:32:39.880000::Fuck Boy in the Jane Austen Times, which is the time that all three of us relate to most.
0:32:39.880000 - 0:32:43.880000::But they don't make them like that anymore.
0:32:43.880000 - 0:32:44.880000::They might have...
0:32:44.880000 - 0:32:47.880000::Did you say that Benjamin Franklin was hooking up?
0:32:47.880000 - 0:32:49.880000::I mean, dude, you're kidding, right?
0:32:49.880000 - 0:32:51.880000::What do you know about Benjamin Franklin?
0:32:51.880000 - 0:32:52.880000::What does anybody know about?
0:32:52.880000 - 0:32:54.880000::What we know much about him.
0:32:54.880000 - 0:32:55.880000::He's not a president.
0:32:55.880000 - 0:32:56.880000::He's American.
0:32:56.880000 - 0:32:57.880000::No.
0:32:57.880000 - 0:32:58.880000::He turned that shit down.
0:32:58.880000 - 0:32:59.880000::They wanted him to be president.
0:32:59.880000 - 0:33:00.880000::He said, nah, I got enough to do.
0:33:00.880000 - 0:33:01.880000::He invented the Bifocal.
0:33:01.880000 - 0:33:03.880000::He invented an electricity in a sense.
0:33:03.880000 - 0:33:05.880000::But with the kite, he invented...
0:33:05.880000 - 0:33:08.880000::I mean, any political maneuvers that we still use to this day.
0:33:08.880000 - 0:33:09.880000::Firefighter.
0:33:09.880000 - 0:33:10.880000::Getting inventing electricity.
0:33:10.880000 - 0:33:11.880000::Getting inventing...
0:33:11.880000 - 0:33:12.880000::He really did.
0:33:12.880000 - 0:33:13.880000::What he invented?
0:33:13.880000 - 0:33:14.880000::Firefighters, bro.
0:33:14.880000 - 0:33:15.880000::He invented firefighters.
0:33:15.880000 - 0:33:17.880000::I don't want to hear that.
0:33:17.880000 - 0:33:19.880000::You can invent a new body.
0:33:19.880000 - 0:33:20.880000::He invented a new body.
0:33:20.880000 - 0:33:21.880000::He invented...
0:33:21.880000 - 0:33:23.880000::No, he's exomorph.
0:33:23.880000 - 0:33:24.880000::What does that mean?
0:33:24.880000 - 0:33:26.880000::You know the different body phenotypes.
0:33:26.880000 - 0:33:27.880000::Exomorph.
0:33:27.880000 - 0:33:28.880000::What am I?
0:33:28.880000 - 0:33:29.880000::You...
0:33:29.880000 - 0:33:30.880000::Well, you've changed.
0:33:30.880000 - 0:33:31.880000::You used to be an exomorph.
0:33:31.880000 - 0:33:32.880000::Exo to endow.
0:33:32.880000 - 0:33:33.880000::You can't.
0:33:33.880000 - 0:33:34.880000::Oh, wait, wait, wait.
0:33:34.880000 - 0:33:35.880000::I'm saying I'm wrong.
0:33:35.880000 - 0:33:36.880000::You're an endomorph.
0:33:36.880000 - 0:33:37.880000::No, you were an endomorph.
0:33:37.880000 - 0:33:39.880000::And now you've fully transformed into ectomorph.
0:33:39.880000 - 0:33:40.880000::What am I?
0:33:40.880000 - 0:33:41.880000::You're an endomorph.
0:33:41.880000 - 0:33:42.880000::What am I?
0:33:42.880000 - 0:33:43.880000::You're an endomorph.
0:33:43.880000 - 0:33:44.880000::You're an endomorph.
0:33:44.880000 - 0:33:45.880000::You're an endomorph.
0:33:45.880000 - 0:33:46.880000::You're an endomorph.
0:33:46.880000 - 0:33:47.880000::You're an endomorph.
0:33:48.880000 - 0:33:53.880000::Now, and now, Benjamin Franklin, definitely an endomorph.
0:33:53.880000 - 0:33:54.880000::I am an endomorph.
0:33:54.880000 - 0:33:55.880000::Jack, you're an endomorph.
0:33:55.880000 - 0:33:56.880000::Okay.
0:33:56.880000 - 0:34:00.880000::Well, I can morph into any type of...
0:34:00.880000 - 0:34:02.880000::You know what I'm saying.
0:34:02.880000 - 0:34:04.880000::I'm an endomorph.
0:34:04.880000 - 0:34:07.880000::We should go through all the presidents and see what type of morph they are.
0:34:07.880000 - 0:34:12.880000::An endomorph is like whether you do baseball or wrestling.
0:34:12.880000 - 0:34:15.880000::No, these are different body types.
0:34:15.880000 - 0:34:17.440000::These are different body types.
0:34:17.440000 - 0:34:18.440000::Right.
0:34:18.440000 - 0:34:20.280000::Like a baseball type is like a, well,
0:34:20.280000 - 0:34:22.360000::they come in all sizes, the bend position you play.
0:34:22.360000 - 0:34:23.880000::So a swimmer versus a wrestler.
0:34:23.880000 - 0:34:24.720000::The basic way.
0:34:24.720000 - 0:34:25.400000::Yeah, that's right.
0:34:25.400000 - 0:34:26.960000::Okay, that's right.
0:34:26.960000 - 0:34:28.400000::One moment.
0:34:28.400000 - 0:34:29.760000::Okay, keep going.
0:34:29.760000 - 0:34:30.600000::Sure.
0:34:30.600000 - 0:34:32.080000::No, we can wait.
0:34:32.080000 - 0:34:39.200000::But I do feel like, you know, Jack, you have some Benjamin Franklin type qualities.
0:34:39.200000 - 0:34:45.840000::Well, I feel like you have the potential to invent something like a bifold.
0:34:45.840000 - 0:34:48.080000::You know, you're like, let's put a glass.
0:34:48.080000 - 0:34:55.160000::Let's put two, like, what have we had a tiny glasses in the middle of your regular glasses?
0:34:55.160000 - 0:34:56.160000::Definitely.
0:34:56.160000 - 0:34:57.160000::Definitely.
0:34:57.160000 - 0:34:58.160000::That feels like something like.
0:34:58.160000 - 0:34:59.160000::I probably already got it.
0:34:59.160000 - 0:35:00.160000::You could.

0:35:00 - 0:35:03.800000::I think I do think that, because what that is is a,
0:35:05.600000 - 0:35:08.320000::you know, he's just building on what somebody had already made.
0:35:09.560000 - 0:35:10.640000::Somebody else made the glasses.
0:35:10.640000 - 0:35:13.960000::So I do feel like, pretty much the way I use every object
0:35:13.960000 - 0:35:15.140000::in my house is like,
0:35:16.120000 - 0:35:18.960000::none of y'all are picking stuff up with your toes like I am.
0:35:18.960000 - 0:35:22.080000::There's just like a lot of, you know,
0:35:23.600000 - 0:35:28.600000::home improvement type of stuff that's in here.
0:35:29.600000 - 0:35:31.600000::Nate, would you shoot the president in the head?
0:35:32.800000 - 0:35:33.600000::Would I?
0:35:35.200000 - 0:35:36.400000::For
0:35:36.600000 - 0:35:40.800000::for the FBI listens to this podcast, no.
0:35:41.600000 - 0:35:42.080000::All right.
0:35:42.080000 - 0:35:43.600000::Now you're one of our biggest,
0:35:45.880000 - 0:35:51.440000::one of our biggest patrons is just the FBI, like the FBI, the NBA,
0:35:52.440000 - 0:35:55.120000::agent at FBI dot com.
0:35:55.120000 - 0:35:57.960000::Yeah, we see you $100 to your only person on there.
0:35:59.040000 - 0:36:03.720000::Yeah, we see you Joe, our bio sliding the DMs every day.
0:36:04.480000 - 0:36:07.600000::We see you department at department of defense.
0:36:08.600000 - 0:36:11.440000::No, of course not, but that is the quickest way to fame.
0:36:11.480000 - 0:36:15.760000::I will say that is it though to kill a, well, you got to kill
0:36:15.760000 - 0:36:17.680000::because you'd have to wait for a president to be there.
0:36:18.680000 - 0:36:21.680000::What if you just killed a goat in the craziest way anyone's ever seen?
0:36:23.680000 - 0:36:26.680000::Then that's what I give you with that give you fame.
0:36:27.680000 - 0:36:30.680000::If it's the craziest way anybody's ever done it.
0:36:30.680000 - 0:36:32.680000::Yeah, obviously I don't think it would.
0:36:32.680000 - 0:36:35.200000::I don't think it really killed if somebody
0:36:35.200000 - 0:36:36.680000::went in the craziest way.
0:36:36.680000 - 0:36:37.680000::Get a goat.
0:36:37.680000 - 0:36:39.680000::Yeah. Okay. What's on the news tomorrow?
0:36:39.680000 - 0:36:40.680000::If you
0:36:41.680000 - 0:36:45.680000::leap, you know, throw a bullet or an object towards the head of the president.
0:36:45.680000 - 0:36:52.680000::I want to say what that is versus versus if you kill a goat by like.
0:36:54.680000 - 0:36:58.680000::God, what's the craziest way you could kill a goat by like squeezing it in half like somehow?
0:36:58.680000 - 0:37:02.680000::Like you put razor blades on the inside of your arms and you fucking psycho.
0:37:02.680000 - 0:37:03.680000::That shit.
0:37:04.680000 - 0:37:05.680000::You know what I'm saying?
0:37:07.680000 - 0:37:09.680000::You've got a base head of minor league baseball game.
0:37:09.680000 - 0:37:12.680000::You go, everybody film this and you take off the mascot.
0:37:12.680000 - 0:37:13.680000::Yo, it's about to be a race.
0:37:13.680000 - 0:37:14.680000::You take a knife.
0:37:14.680000 - 0:37:15.680000::I guess that would be viral.
0:37:15.680000 - 0:37:20.680000::And then if you if you announce your name to I'm Jack mother fucking Benzingen.
0:37:22.680000 - 0:37:25.680000::And then you play the I got 21 questions.
0:37:27.680000 - 0:37:29.680000::Slice the fucking goat right there.
0:37:30.680000 - 0:37:32.680000::What who's going to get more clicks the next day?
0:37:32.680000 - 0:37:34.680000::Yeah, we don't even know the name of this fucking kid.
0:37:34.680000 - 0:37:41.680000::By the way, this kid who who tried to shoot kill president's ex president's ear couldn't even kill his ear.
0:37:42.680000 - 0:37:43.680000::Pathetic.
0:37:44.680000 - 0:37:46.680000::We don't even know who that the fuck is.
0:37:46.680000 - 0:37:50.680000::If he had done the goat thing, they just found explosives in his car.
0:37:50.680000 - 0:37:51.680000::They did.
0:37:51.680000 - 0:37:52.680000::Are you kidding me?
0:37:52.680000 - 0:37:54.680000::Just follow the live off.
0:37:54.680000 - 0:37:56.680000::What kind of card do you drive?
0:37:56.680000 - 0:37:58.680000::Don't tell me it was a sob.
0:37:59.680000 - 0:38:00.680000::They don't make those anymore.
0:38:00.680000 - 0:38:02.680000::So actually wouldn't hurt the brand.
0:38:02.680000 - 0:38:03.680000::I still make them.
0:38:06.680000 - 0:38:07.680000::You still make up?
0:38:07.680000 - 0:38:08.680000::Yeah.
0:38:08.680000 - 0:38:12.680000::I'm designing a new type of electric sob that's going to bring it all back.
0:38:14.680000 - 0:38:16.680000::The suicide door sob pick up.
0:38:16.680000 - 0:38:18.680000::Here's in the car market right now.

0:48:27.120000 - 0:48:32.120000::It's funny that you all feel at all like Trump got hit in the ear
0:48:32.120000 - 0:48:36.120000::and you have almost nothing to say about it whatsoever.
0:48:36.120000 - 0:48:38.120000::Yeah, what's a.

0:48:42.120000 - 0:48:43.120000::Yeah, there's a picture.
0:48:43.120000 - 0:48:48.120000::If he had a hit him in the eye and he had like he came out with an eye patch,
0:48:48.120000 - 0:48:49.120000::wouldn't that be fucking crazy?
0:48:49.120000 - 0:48:52.120000::That would be the picture you see in the history books.
0:48:52.120000 - 0:48:54.120000::Or if he had a cool ass scar,
0:48:54.120000 - 0:48:55.120000::have it scarred him up like a carrot,
0:48:55.120000 - 0:48:57.120000::and we call them back a carrot?
0:48:57.120000 - 0:49:00.120000::I think that was the plan from the Trump campaign.
0:49:00.120000 - 0:49:02.120000::They were trying to give him some like gash across his head.
0:49:02.120000 - 0:49:07.120000::So we could be like a fucking melody or solid like Bill and you know what I'm saying?

0:49:26.120000 - 0:49:30.120000::Trump just got just went from orange to red pathetic.
0:49:30.120000 - 0:49:39.120000::He's he looks less like a cheeto and more like a what's red hot cheat hot ass.
