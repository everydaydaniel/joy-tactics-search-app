0:00:39.800000 - 0:00:40.800000::It's a secret.
0:00:40.800000 - 0:00:47.800000::Hey guys, it's a secret.
0:00:47.800000 - 0:00:50.800000::That is going to blow people's fucking.
0:00:50.800000 - 0:00:52.800000::Yeah, that is going to kill somebody.
0:00:52.800000 - 0:00:53.800000::That's going to be it.
0:00:53.800000 - 0:00:58.800000::That's someone's first episode of No Question and they just had a song.
0:00:58.800000 - 0:01:05.800000::I swear to God, I'm so sorry because I know somebody turned up their volume all the way.
0:01:05.800000 - 0:01:09.800000::I'm so sorry.
0:01:09.800000 - 0:01:12.800000::That's the first secret about this episode.
0:01:12.800000 - 0:01:16.800000::Yeah, I'll take care of it.
0:01:16.800000 - 0:01:20.800000::Today we're discussing the issue of secrets.
0:01:20.800000 - 0:01:22.800000::Why do we need to have them?
0:01:22.800000 - 0:01:24.800000::What's the function?
0:01:24.800000 - 0:01:26.800000::Because not everyone can handle it.
0:01:26.800000 - 0:01:27.800000::You can't handle the truth.
0:01:27.800000 - 0:01:29.800000::Remember that one from traffic.
0:01:29.800000 - 0:01:30.800000::Traffic or traffic.
0:01:30.800000 - 0:01:31.800000::Right.
0:01:31.800000 - 0:01:32.800000::Right.
0:01:32.800000 - 0:01:33.800000::What does that look like?
0:01:33.800000 - 0:01:39.800000::Well, I'd like to take everybody back to a wonderful movie starring Mr. Ricky Juerbeis called
0:01:39.800000 - 0:01:41.800000::The Invention of Lying.
0:01:41.800000 - 0:01:48.800000::Now, this movie, this man, I forget the plot, but essentially he ends up in the dimension
0:01:48.800000 - 0:01:53.280000::of reality to where no one has invented lying yet.
0:01:53.280000 - 0:01:58.280000::So he's like, damn, I have a superpower I can just lie to people and get away with it
0:01:58.280000 - 0:02:03.280000::because I don't understand that you could say something not untrue.
0:02:03.280000 - 0:02:04.280000::Right.
0:02:04.280000 - 0:02:06.280000::And they don't even know what secrets are, really.
0:02:06.280000 - 0:02:07.280000::What a horror.
0:02:07.280000 - 0:02:08.280000::And I can tell you why.
0:02:08.280000 - 0:02:09.280000::And you think that would be utopia, right?
0:02:09.280000 - 0:02:14.280000::Turns out it's a hellhole and lying is a core part of the human nature.
0:02:14.280000 - 0:02:21.280000::Ricky Juerbeis is not afraid to take you into deep and horrifying waters
0:02:21.280000 - 0:02:26.280000::and show you some of the most fucked up shit in the world.
0:02:26.280000 - 0:02:27.280000::Damn.
0:02:27.280000 - 0:02:31.280000::I hope you're reading the biography for Ricky Juerbeis.
0:02:31.280000 - 0:02:32.280000::I'm right.
0:02:32.280000 - 0:02:33.280000::This one's authorized.
0:02:33.280000 - 0:02:35.280000::The Dax Eppert one is unauthorized.
0:02:35.280000 - 0:02:38.280000::This one is very authorized.
0:02:38.280000 - 0:02:39.280000::I'm in close contact.
0:02:39.280000 - 0:02:41.280000::I'm paying him to do it.
0:02:41.280000 - 0:02:42.280000::But I appreciate it.
0:02:42.280000 - 0:02:46.280000::He's going to give me a stake in Jervase World when that opens up at the Jervase.
0:02:46.280000 - 0:02:48.280000::The Ricky Juerbeis theme park.
0:02:48.280000 - 0:02:49.280000::Jervase flags.
0:02:49.280000 - 0:02:50.280000::It's going to be.
0:02:50.280000 - 0:02:52.280000::This guy is right in the world.
0:02:52.280000 - 0:02:55.280000::Rides that don't move around much, but they make you question your reality
0:02:55.280000 - 0:02:57.280000::and make you question authority as well.
0:02:57.280000 - 0:02:58.280000::Right.
0:02:58.280000 - 0:03:01.280000::Every ride is his also him killing a different deity.
0:03:01.280000 - 0:03:02.280000::Right.
0:03:02.280000 - 0:03:03.280000::And this doesn't.
0:03:03.280000 - 0:03:04.280000::This couldn't be.
0:03:04.280000 - 0:03:06.280000::He was a few fools.
0:03:06.280000 - 0:03:08.280000::Ricky Juerbeis, come on.
0:03:08.280000 - 0:03:09.280000::The criminal.
0:03:09.280000 - 0:03:11.280000::I would got to make criminals.
0:03:11.280000 - 0:03:14.280000::Assage that neck of that big neck of his.
0:03:14.280000 - 0:03:15.280000::Oh, yeah.
0:03:15.280000 - 0:03:16.280000::Extra luchy.
0:03:16.280000 - 0:03:17.280000::Extra.
0:03:17.280000 - 0:03:18.280000::Shay Butter.
0:03:18.280000 - 0:03:20.280000::He mentioned a lying.
0:03:20.280000 - 0:03:22.280000::You know why he lies?
0:03:22.280000 - 0:03:23.280000::Why, man?
0:03:23.280000 - 0:03:30.280000::Because his busted old mom is dying in the hospital bed.
0:03:30.280000 - 0:03:37.280000::And he says, Mama, when we die, I swear we're going to be together again.
0:03:37.280000 - 0:03:44.280000::Because he's too afraid to admit the truth, which all of us atheists know for a fact.
0:03:44.280000 - 0:03:46.280000::There's nothing after this shit, dude.
0:03:46.280000 - 0:03:47.280000::That's it.
0:03:47.280000 - 0:03:48.280000::Go crazy.
0:03:48.280000 - 0:03:49.280000::Hope you had fun.
0:03:49.280000 - 0:03:50.280000::That's it.
0:03:50.280000 - 0:03:51.280000::That's all you get.
0:03:51.280000 - 0:03:52.280000::Welcome to Oblivion.
0:03:52.280000 - 0:03:54.280000::You paid for one ticket.
0:03:54.280000 - 0:03:56.280000::The end of the ride is over.
0:03:56.280000 - 0:03:57.280000::Death is coming.
0:03:57.280000 - 0:03:58.280000::And what did you do?
0:03:58.280000 - 0:04:02.280000::You wasted it on hand and you kissing the toes of some fake God that doesn't even exist.
0:04:02.280000 - 0:04:06.280000::When you could have been out there smoking cigarettes on the bluff.
0:04:06.280000 - 0:04:07.280000::Right.
0:04:07.280000 - 0:04:08.280000::Essing and effing.
0:04:08.280000 - 0:04:09.280000::Crying.
0:04:09.280000 - 0:04:12.280000::And how long did you wait in line for this fucking experience, dude?
0:04:12.280000 - 0:04:15.280000::You waited four billion years to get one little.
0:04:15.280000 - 0:04:16.280000::You waited the life that you waited for.
0:04:16.280000 - 0:04:17.280000::You fool.
0:04:17.280000 - 0:04:18.280000::You fool.
0:04:18.280000 - 0:04:19.280000::You fool.
0:04:19.280000 - 0:04:20.280000::You fool.
0:04:20.280000 - 0:04:23.280000::So make sure you're not that guy when you fucking die.
0:04:23.280000 - 0:04:26.280000::Or you make a movie called the invention of none.
0:04:26.280000 - 0:04:27.280000::None.
0:04:27.280000 - 0:04:29.280000::You know what I'm talking about.
0:04:29.280000 - 0:04:35.280000::It's Nate and Jim figuring out how to trick it for the first time or riding calculations.
0:04:35.280000 - 0:04:36.280000::Yeah.
0:04:36.280000 - 0:04:37.280000::Crazy beacuse.
0:04:37.280000 - 0:04:38.280000::Exploding.
0:04:38.280000 - 0:04:41.280000::Well, you've been suspiciously quiet.
0:04:41.280000 - 0:04:47.280000::Well, because I'm thinking I'm thinking about a very powerful topic.
0:04:47.280000 - 0:04:48.280000::Okay.
0:04:48.280000 - 0:04:49.280000::What is it?
0:04:49.280000 - 0:04:50.280000::Secrets.
0:04:50.280000 - 0:04:51.280000::That is secret.
0:04:51.280000 - 0:04:53.280000::Well, that's what I was thinking about.
0:04:53.280000 - 0:04:58.280000::A secret is almost tied to your perspective.
0:04:58.280000 - 0:04:59.280000::Now, why did I...

0:05:00 - 0:05:03.680000::How did I think that because we're bringing up gods and deities?
0:05:03.680000 - 0:05:05.480000::I don't fucking know.
0:05:05.480000 - 0:05:07.480000::Does God have secrets?
0:05:07.480000 - 0:05:13.880000::A secret can't even, you can't even hold a secret from God.
0:05:13.880000 - 0:05:17.120000::So God knows all of your secrets, right?
0:05:17.120000 - 0:05:18.120000::Right.
0:05:18.120000 - 0:05:21.280000::But does God have secrets?
0:05:21.280000 - 0:05:22.280000::He definitely does.
0:05:22.280000 - 0:05:23.280000::Yes.
0:05:23.280000 - 0:05:27.600000::He definitely does because if God told you the truth of everything, if the real nature of
0:05:27.600000 - 0:05:32.560000::reality was revealed to you by God himself or herself as I like to think, you would be
0:05:32.560000 - 0:05:35.720000::blinded to death and you wouldn't be able to understand it.
0:05:35.720000 - 0:05:39.440000::So yeah, he has to hold some of, or she has to hold some of those things close to the
0:05:39.440000 - 0:05:43.560000::chest, secret style for your benefit.
0:05:43.560000 - 0:05:44.560000::If you were a...
0:05:44.560000 - 0:05:49.400000::It's called the most benevolent white lie that ever existed the lie of reality.
0:05:49.400000 - 0:05:50.400000::That's a secret.
0:05:50.400000 - 0:05:52::That is a beautiful, beautiful one.
0:05:52 - 0:05:53::I love that secret.
0:05:53 - 0:05:54::That's not secret.
0:05:54 - 0:05:55.560000::Cats out of the bag.
0:05:55.640000 - 0:05:57.720000::Cats out of the bag, bitch.
0:05:57.720000 - 0:06:05.620000::If you were at a diner off the highway on a road trip somewhere in Pennsylvania with
0:06:05.620000 - 0:06:18.120000::G-O-D eating some hush puppies, he could, or she could say some things at that diner to
0:06:18.120000 - 0:06:20.040000::you in one second.
0:06:20.040000 - 0:06:23.560000::That would make you basically flip out and start tripping crazy.
0:06:23.560000 - 0:06:25.240000::The power of sentences.
0:06:25.240000 - 0:06:28.600000::Imagine tripping mentally from just a secret, hearing a secret.
0:06:28.600000 - 0:06:34.120000::That's probably what this podcast is like, is like incredible doses of sentences.
0:06:34.120000 - 0:06:39.960000::If I told you guys I've been running a Black Ops program for my house, Drone Style, making
0:06:39.960000 - 0:06:42.280000::millions of dollars on the mercenary market.
0:06:42.280000 - 0:06:46.160000::I told you guys that over some French fries and ketchup.
0:06:46.160000 - 0:06:48.880000::Yeah, you guys are too tripped.
0:06:48.880000 - 0:06:53.400000::I would literally start just partying and putting music on.
0:06:54.240000 - 0:06:55.240000::Oh, one time.
0:06:55.240000 - 0:07:00.840000::So my man speaking of diners in Pennsylvania, we were driving to Chicago and we pulled off
0:07:00.840000 - 0:07:02.640000::to get some dine of food.
0:07:02.640000 - 0:07:08.240000::And one of the diners in town, the only diner in this goddamn town was called puke diner.
0:07:08.240000 - 0:07:09.240000::No, man.
0:07:09.240000 - 0:07:11.840000::I'm not kidding you, dude.
0:07:11.840000 - 0:07:13.240000::I'm not kidding your ass.
0:07:13.240000 - 0:07:15.480000::P-U-K-E-P-UK.
0:07:15.480000 - 0:07:18.960000::And they had a fridge and we parked and we were going to go in but then we thought,
0:07:18.960000 - 0:07:20.800000::nah, because they had a fridge in there.
0:07:20.800000 - 0:07:24.640000::You know, they have those, what they call fridges, but they keep cold beverages.
0:07:24.640000 - 0:07:25.640000::Refridgerators.
0:07:25.640000 - 0:07:26.640000::Yeah, yeah.
0:07:26.640000 - 0:07:27.640000::Refridgerators.
0:07:27.640000 - 0:07:31.360000::And out of those, they were selling Mad Dog 2020.
0:07:31.360000 - 0:07:32.360000::The hot sauce.
0:07:32.360000 - 0:07:33.360000::The diner?
0:07:33.360000 - 0:07:36.040000::Can you imagine getting some MD 2020?
0:07:36.040000 - 0:07:38.120000::Or maybe it's just called Mad Dog 20?
0:07:38.120000 - 0:07:39.120000::I don't know.
0:07:39.120000 - 0:07:40.120000::Remember that shit?
0:07:40.120000 - 0:07:41.120000::Fortify a bunch?
0:07:41.120000 - 0:07:42.120000::I think it's a lot of people.
0:07:42.120000 - 0:07:43.120000::Oh, of course.
0:07:43.120000 - 0:07:44.120000::Oh my god.
0:07:44.120000 - 0:07:45.120000::On the road trip.
0:07:45.120000 - 0:07:46.120000::On the road trip.

0:08:25.200000 - 0:08:27.400000::I felt it would fall so many times.
0:08:31.880000 - 0:08:33.520000::So what's fun with the iPod mini?
0:08:33.880000 - 0:08:34.320000::Yeah.
0:08:35.240000 - 0:08:35.920000::That's a secret.
0:08:35.920000 - 0:08:36.760000::I never told you guys.
0:08:36.760000 - 0:08:37.560000::So is that a secret?
0:08:37.560000 - 0:08:41.800000::Cause I held that one, two, three, airs back in.
0:08:43.920000 - 0:08:44.760000::You stopped reporting.
0:08:44.960000 - 0:08:45.480000::Okay.
0:08:45.480000 - 0:08:46.160000::Hell no.
0:08:48.400000 - 0:08:49.960000::We're using the Zoom recording.
0:08:49.960000 - 0:08:52.800000::That's why I just learned airs back in just like that.
0:08:52.800000 - 0:08:53.120000::Okay.
0:08:53.120000 - 0:08:56.400000::And so what's funny is does God have secrets?
0:08:57.400000 - 0:09:00.400000::I'll tell you what, this is an interesting discussion.
0:09:00.400000 - 0:09:02.480000::Because can a secret exist in the woods?
0:09:02.480000 - 0:09:05.240000::If somebody says a secret to themselves to a tree in the woods,
0:09:05.240000 - 0:09:07.240000::is it a secret anymore?
0:09:07.240000 - 0:09:08.840000::See what I'm going with this?
0:09:08.840000 - 0:09:10.840000::Of course I see where you're going with this.
0:09:10.840000 - 0:09:15.840000::If God knows everything, then everything you don't know
0:09:16.080000 - 0:09:19.840000::is a secret of God, but that brings it back right interestingly
0:09:19.840000 - 0:09:22.360000::in a sense back to the conversation,
0:09:22.360000 - 0:09:27.360000::which we are just discussing of what qualifies something to be a secret.
0:09:27.360000 - 0:09:29.040000::Is it the person who hears it?
0:09:29.040000 - 0:09:34.080000::Do they have to get their mind blown from the back enough to see it as a secret?
0:09:34.080000 - 0:09:35.120000::Or can it just be anything?
0:09:35.120000 - 0:09:38.200000::Yo, Eric, I had a little croit today.
0:09:38.200000 - 0:09:39.600000::Oh, did you?
0:09:39.600000 - 0:09:42::That's just information or is that information?
0:09:42 - 0:09:43.240000::I made new information.
0:09:43.240000 - 0:09:44.320000::That's a new information.
0:09:44.320000 - 0:09:46.320000::A secret needs to be something that can be reverted.
0:09:46.320000 - 0:09:49.320000::That can damage some life or benefit them.
0:09:49.320000 - 0:09:51.320000::Yes, I see.
0:09:51.320000 - 0:09:53.320000::That's it.
0:09:53.320000 - 0:09:54.320000::I have a secret birthday.
0:09:54.320000 - 0:09:55.320000::I will.
0:09:55.320000 - 0:09:56.320000::Cake for you.
0:09:56.320000 - 0:09:57.320000::Yeah.
0:09:57.320000 - 0:09:59.320000::And this is what I want to say is sometimes secrets you...

0:10:00 - 0:10:04.840000::you hold withhold information because you want to protect the other person.
0:10:04.840000 - 0:10:05.720000::That's right.
0:10:06.720000 - 0:10:10.840000::You don't want that knowing this information, even though you want to be truthful,
0:10:11.120000 - 0:10:13.360000::they should know this information.
0:10:13.600000 - 0:10:19.560000::They should know all this stuff that, you know, uh, that, that would ruin their life,
0:10:19.600000 - 0:10:22.280000::but you don't want to tell them because you don't have the heart.
0:10:23.160000 - 0:10:24.120000::Well, that's what people,
0:10:24.120000 - 0:10:25.760000::you don't want to see them spiral out of control.
0:10:26.800000 - 0:10:28.960000::That's what Democrats don't understand about Joe Biden.
0:10:29.360000 - 0:10:31.160000::Oh, he's so quiet at his speeches.
0:10:31.160000 - 0:10:32.280000::He's not giving us information.
0:10:32.280000 - 0:10:32.760000::It's not so wise.
0:10:32.760000 - 0:10:38.640000::He's not saying anything whenever Joe Biden stammer and studies just know that the sentence
0:10:38.640000 - 0:10:45::that went through his head that he almost just said would cause another global meltdown
0:10:45 - 0:10:48.040000::financially worse that would make the frickin right.
0:10:48.040000 - 0:10:50.720000::Well, having in the 30s, that would make the great depression look like the great
0:10:50.720000 - 0:10:51.760000::baked British bake off.
0:10:51.800000 - 0:10:56.240000::Okay, because the depression that we hit the United States after Joe Biden said the secrets
0:10:56.240000 - 0:11:00.200000::that he knows and the reasons the things that he's doing to protect us.
0:11:00.800000 - 0:11:05.040000::He's constantly on the verge of holding back the truth about why aliens come to invade us.
0:11:05.520000 - 0:11:07.640000::The reality is the white.
0:11:08.840000 - 0:11:12.200000::You guys haven't seen the second term Biden when he doesn't have.
0:11:12.200000 - 0:11:12.920000::He has.
0:11:12.920000 - 0:11:13.200000::Yeah.
0:11:13.200000 - 0:11:13.400000::He has.
0:11:13.400000 - 0:11:13.960000::Oh,

0:11:14.600000 - 0:11:16.600000::you know, he's probably Republicans beware.
0:11:16.920000 - 0:11:18.200000::You're if it's scared.
0:11:18.560000 - 0:11:19.320000::That's right.
0:11:20 - 0:11:20.920000::By then.
0:11:21.080000 - 0:11:25.560000::Oh, when Joe Biden's in the lame duck era of his presidency,
0:11:25.560000 - 0:11:27.400000::I just just you wait.
0:11:27.720000 - 0:11:31.120000::He's about to drop some crazy go to diet.
0:11:33 - 0:11:34.400000::He's probably waiting to do it.
0:11:34.400000 - 0:11:36.200000::He's like, fucking fishing weights.
0:11:36.600000 - 0:11:37.920000::You're seeing it die right.
0:11:37.920000 - 0:11:39::Oh,
0:11:39 - 0:11:39.520000::shit.

0:11:55.120000 - 0:11:57::And he has the cure and he swallowed it.
0:11:57.080000 - 0:12:00.680000::They invented the pill for bisexuality curing and he swallowed it, but he put it.
0:12:00.720000 - 0:12:02.440000::Not he breathed it in rather.

0:14:10.680000 - 0:14:11.800000::And you wanted sympathy.
0:14:12.760000 - 0:14:13.680000::I want sympathy.
0:14:13.680000 - 0:14:16.320000::I want people to feel bad for me.

0:14:43.680000 - 0:14:44.960000::Of course.

0:16:21.600000 - 0:16:23.280000::That's just a natural inclination.
0:16:25.040000 - 0:16:26.080000::Well, school is a lie.
0:16:26.080000 - 0:16:28.480000::If you have to go to school, you're far far behind.
0:16:28.680000 - 0:16:29.360000::That's for sure.

0:16:39.040000 - 0:16:42.280000::Jack, it looks like you're reporting the emphysema chronicles right now.
0:16:42.280000 - 0:16:44.120000::Like you're hooked up to a machine and having to.
0:16:45.240000 - 0:16:46.080000::Looks on you, bitch.
0:16:46.080000 - 0:16:47.480000::I don't know what emphysema is.
0:16:48.520000 - 0:16:50.160000::Well, you will soon enough.

0:17:09.640000 - 0:17:15.560000::Do you think there's any chance that the United States is the last country that
0:17:15.560000 - 0:17:22.040000::exists and outside of these walls is nothing but pure demonic alienic hell.
0:17:23.040000 - 0:17:29.040000::And Joe Biden is keeping it keeping us at bay, not at bay, but at protection.
0:17:29.920000 - 0:17:32.600000::Well, I'll just tell you guys this.
0:17:32.640000 - 0:17:39.360000::I've been to Europe three times in my life coming on four next time I go.
0:17:40.400000 - 0:17:42.960000::And let's just say you think America's perfect, right?
0:17:43.240000 - 0:17:47.920000::Do you think we have the best foods and the hottest models and the best sounding accents?
0:17:48.600000 - 0:17:49.600000::Well, guess what?
0:17:49.600000 - 0:17:51.520000::Europe's got us fucking B.
0:17:53 - 0:17:55.240000::Europe beat us silly with his culture.
0:17:55.720000 - 0:17:57::We're lucky to have a cool.
0:17:57 - 0:17:59.320000::We got we kind of got all our culture from Europe.
0:18:00.400000 - 0:18:02.280000::And then all the other countries, of course, that came in.
0:18:02.280000 - 0:18:03.520000::It's America's melting pot.
0:18:04.320000 - 0:18:05.960000::But Europe is heavenly.
0:18:06.160000 - 0:18:07.200000::Europe is amazing.
0:18:07.200000 - 0:18:11.440000::And if you talk shit on Europe for one second, Jack, if you say that Europe is full of angels
0:18:11.440000 - 0:18:17.200000::and I mean, of aliens and demons, then you are mass with the wrong one today.
0:18:17.720000 - 0:18:19.080000::I'm not going to say that, dude.
0:18:19.280000 - 0:18:20.360000::I'm not going to say that.
0:18:20.360000 - 0:18:21.240000::Of course I'm not.
0:18:21.520000 - 0:18:28.240000::However, I'm going to ask you to take a deep breath and open your mind to what is possible
0:18:28.440000 - 0:18:29.640000::when I tell you this.
0:18:31.040000 - 0:18:33.160000::Imagine you get up in the sky.
0:18:34.160000 - 0:18:37.080000::You put your upboas soundproof headphones on.
0:18:37.080000 - 0:18:41.720000::You put on your anti-anxiety playlist on the calm app.
0:18:41.760000 - 0:18:42.520000::Tamipala.
0:18:43.160000 - 0:18:44.040000::Tamipala.
0:18:44.800000 - 0:18:49.120000::And you watched whatever zone of interest again for the fifth time.
0:18:51.320000 - 0:18:52.320000::Yeah.
0:18:52.720000 - 0:18:55.320000::You hit flying in circles six hours away, right?
0:18:55.320000 - 0:18:56.680000::But you're flying in circles.
0:18:57.160000 - 0:18:59.160000::You land back at JFK.
0:19:00.200000 - 0:19:03.520000::But it doesn't look like JFK because Biden has done the full flip.
0:19:03.520000 - 0:19:06.640000::You ever notice when you're in Europe that people look strangely familiar?
0:19:07.600000 - 0:19:08.880000::You ever buy bread off somebody?
0:19:08.880000 - 0:19:09.680000::Prego.
0:19:09.680000 - 0:19:10.280000::Prego.
0:19:10.280000 - 0:19:11.160000::You go with the fuck.
0:19:11.640000 - 0:19:13.160000::That looks like Devon Walker from us.
0:19:13.160000 - 0:19:15.440000::And now you ever see somebody else?
0:19:15.440000 - 0:19:15.960000::What the fuck?
0:19:15.960000 - 0:19:16.440000::Prego.
0:19:19.720000 - 0:19:20.640000::What's French?
0:19:21.600000 - 0:19:22.600000::Ulet toilet.
0:19:22.840000 - 0:19:23.600000::Let's toilet.
0:19:23.680000 - 0:19:24.480000::Oh, that looks like.
0:19:24.480000 - 0:19:25.080000::Like you did from us and now.
0:19:25.080000 - 0:19:26.280000::Like you did from us now.
0:19:26.760000 - 0:19:29.920000::Do you ever think that what I'm saying is
0:19:31.160000 - 0:19:36.520000::if that this is the scheme that they're putting on almost true and show ask
0:19:37.280000 - 0:19:41.360000::to protect you from, I'm not saying European devils and aliens, but
0:19:42.520000 - 0:19:44.520000::this is the type of theater that could be going on.
0:19:44.520000 - 0:19:48.320000::The type of secrets that could be being held from you right now, man.
0:19:48.600000 - 0:19:49.600000::I can feel my fear.
0:19:49.600000 - 0:19:50.400000::Why are you so afraid?
0:19:50.400000 - 0:19:51.080000::I'm scared.
0:19:51.080000 - 0:19:55.280000::It's because I think I blood pressure, which is to see my body's keeping for me.
0:19:56 - 0:19:57.320000::And that doesn't have to do with fear.
0:19:57.440000 - 0:19:58.920000::High blood pressure has to do with passion.

0:20:00 - 0:20:03::So, okay.
0:20:03 - 0:20:04.640000::Yeah, I don't know what I would fucking do.

0:22:33.520000 - 0:22:36.320000::But dragons gone down on each other.
0:22:36.320000 - 0:22:37.160000::And that's cool.
0:22:37.160000 - 0:22:38::It's fine.
0:22:38 - 0:22:39.320000::It's not my thing.
0:22:39.320000 - 0:22:42.400000::No, this one I literally just forgot the name.
0:22:42.400000 - 0:22:45.640000::But it's about first contact with aliens.
0:22:45.640000 - 0:22:47.400000::Not cool at all, these shit.
0:22:47.400000 - 0:22:48.480000::Yeah.
0:22:48.480000 - 0:22:50.720000::I got a new book.
0:22:50.720000 - 0:22:51.960000::What is it?
0:22:51.960000 - 0:22:56.800000::It's the book that the new Paul Thomas Anderson movie is based on.
0:22:56.800000 - 0:23:00.040000::And I want people to play for me.
0:23:00.040000 - 0:23:01.640000::Nuclear worsen area.
0:23:01.640000 - 0:23:03.120000::It's by Thomas Pinchin.
0:23:03.120000 - 0:23:04.640000::Or yeah.
0:23:04.640000 - 0:23:05.480000::Thomas.
0:23:05.480000 - 0:23:07.280000::Oh, Mr. Pinchin.
0:23:07.280000 - 0:23:12.120000::And I think he kind of famously writes really things
0:23:12.120000 - 0:23:13.400000::that are hard to read.
0:23:13.400000 - 0:23:16.800000::And I was like, why did I fucking get this book?
0:23:16.800000 - 0:23:21.920000::You know what my advice is for people like us who are trying to read these books.
0:23:21.920000 - 0:23:22.920000::What's that?
0:23:22.920000 - 0:23:23.920000::I have some advice.
0:23:23.920000 - 0:23:27.240000::And maybe this is relevant for all three of us.
0:23:27.240000 - 0:23:29.880000::None of us are really smart like that.
0:23:29.880000 - 0:23:30.880000::You know what I'm saying?
0:23:30.880000 - 0:23:32.920000::We're not really like Jack.
0:23:32.920000 - 0:23:37.120000::We were talking about this after hearing some real film nerds talk about film to the
0:23:37.120000 - 0:23:41.480000::point to what the way that they're talking about film makes me not enjoy it at all.
0:23:41.480000 - 0:23:42.480000::You know what I mean?
0:23:42.480000 - 0:23:43.480000::I want to enjoy books.
0:23:43.480000 - 0:23:46.200000::Because they know the shoes and music.
0:23:46.200000 - 0:23:47.200000::You know what I mean?
0:23:47.200000 - 0:23:48.200000::I just want to talk about how to make me feel, huh?
0:23:48.200000 - 0:23:49.200000::Right.
0:23:49.200000 - 0:23:52.520000::You know, it's funny expiration, because knowing what's in the soup isn't what ruins
0:23:52.520000 - 0:23:53.520000::the soup, right?
0:23:53.520000 - 0:23:57.020000::It's actually knowing every single soup that's ever existed.
0:23:57.020000 - 0:23:58.020000::Yeah.
0:23:58.020000 - 0:23:59.020000::Right.
0:23:59.020000 - 0:24:00.020000::You don't need to know about it.
0:24:00.020000 - 0:24:01.020000::I guess that.
0:24:01.020000 - 0:24:03.920000::And I guess that from 1972 to enjoying this fucking 2024 soup.
0:24:03.920000 - 0:24:06::You know what I'm saying?
0:24:06 - 0:24:12.720000::But what my advice is just read the words and let them follow you and feel what you feel.
0:24:12.720000 - 0:24:17.120000::Unless you feel like that paragraph is really unless there's a plot that's important and
0:24:17.120000 - 0:24:21.360000::you need to be like, oh, I mean, but just let the words wash over you and eventually
0:24:21.360000 - 0:24:23.320000::guess what?
0:24:23.320000 - 0:24:24.320000::These more complex books.
0:24:24.320000 - 0:24:26.520000::Your brain kind of gets accustomed to reading it.
0:24:26.520000 - 0:24:27.520000::You know what I mean?
0:24:27.520000 - 0:24:32.360000::You're training your brain book by book to understand someone else's expression of consciousness.
0:24:32.360000 - 0:24:33.720000::You know what I'm saying?
0:24:33.720000 - 0:24:38.720000::And so then about 150 pages in, you're like so plugged in with how they're writing.
0:24:38.720000 - 0:24:41.960000::You don't have to understand every single thing you just need to understand how that shit
0:24:41.960000 - 0:24:42.960000::makes you feel.
0:24:42.960000 - 0:24:45.960000::I feel like this book for you was like a lemony snippet.
0:24:45.960000 - 0:24:46.960000::Yeah.
0:24:46.960000 - 0:24:47.960000::Yeah.
0:24:47.960000 - 0:24:48.960000::It's the reptile room.
0:24:48.960000 - 0:24:49.960000::The eighth reading level.
0:24:49.960000 - 0:24:50.960000::But number two.
0:24:50.960000 - 0:24:55.960000::I moved on up to ninth grade reading level.
0:24:55.960000 - 0:24:56.960000::Yeah.
0:24:56.960000 - 0:24:57.960000::Damn.
0:24:57.960000 - 0:24:58.960000::I was.
0:24:58.960000 - 0:24:59.960000::You know what I do?

0:25:00 - 0:25:06.520000::I do feel silly when I'm on Duolingo trying to learn Spanish and trying to learn Russian and I'm like
0:25:06.520000 - 0:25:13.760000::and I have a joke about learning Duolingo English. I know I joke about that a lot but I do think that there is still a lot of
0:25:14.360000 - 0:25:21.120000::Headway to be made in being fluent in English and I do feel like why the fuck am I learning trying to learn these other languages?
0:25:21.120000 - 0:25:24.280000::Wait, what are you saying? You're taking Duolingo for English right now?
0:25:24.920000 - 0:25:27.720000::No, this is a joke as an incentive.
0:25:27.720000 - 0:25:34.640000::I joke I play about that. It's a joke that I keep my back pocket. I call it a back pocket joke
0:25:35.880000 - 0:25:39.920000::Because I can count on the fact that I'm gonna mess something up, but guess what dude?
0:25:39.920000 - 0:25:46.080000::I think there's truth in that there's truth behind every lie behind every whatever. There's truth in comedy
0:25:46.800000 - 0:25:51.560000::I wasn't gonna say that. I don't want to put that information out there if you don't know what that book is yet
0:25:52.200000 - 0:25:55.440000::Just go ahead and cancel your plan for the next two weeks. Yeah
0:25:56.240000 - 0:26:00.520000::Go read that one. I read that book and I was about 17. Do you guys know that?
0:26:01.280000 - 0:26:06.840000::Yeah, I did too. I read it in high school. I was like this is my here. This is gonna be my life
0:26:08.960000 - 0:26:10.960000::That's crazy. I
0:26:10.960000 - 0:26:15.220000::Basically got tricked into moving to Chicago. That's a that's a book about improv
0:26:16.240000 - 0:26:21.760000::Yeah, I'm gonna let you carry Chicago. Del close. Del close and sure enough. I'm just trying to help her
0:26:22.440000 - 0:26:27.040000::Yeah, wow, I'm dead. I'm sure it's dead. Sharner Halper is I
0:26:27.800000 - 0:26:29.800000::Tell you a sharner Halper in story
0:26:30.360000 - 0:26:31.600000::I basically
0:26:31.600000 - 0:26:37.240000::Glee got forced against my will to make a musical sketch comedy review
0:26:38.200000 - 0:26:42.480000::This is a secret that I didn't know you're gonna tell the whole world, but here we go
0:26:42.480000 - 0:26:48.360000::I don't think there's any reason not to to be fair. I won't tell us very much about it, but this was
0:26:49.360000 - 0:26:56.240000::The owner of IO comedy theater whatever she before she is the last thing she directed
0:26:56.240000 - 0:27:00.680000::I believe is a deep most busted musical sketch comedy review in the world
0:27:01.400000 - 0:27:05.400000::Which I was situationally pressured into writing and performing in
0:27:06.240000 - 0:27:09.960000::Because I thought this for sure would get all of us on SNL. It's a layup
0:27:10.840000 - 0:27:13.160000::reality we cast people from like
0:27:14.160000 - 0:27:18.880000::Like a backpages.com who had no involvement in the comedy scene and
0:27:19.560000 - 0:27:25.840000::I was out to lunch. It sucked about four people came to the show and I remember every
0:27:26.720000 - 0:27:28.720000::Like writing meeting
0:27:28.960000 - 0:27:37.240000::Oh, you'd go to Sharner's office. She has all these poor dogs who are like every single one of them has like it's basically begging to die
0:27:37.560000 - 0:27:39.400000::They all have like
0:27:39.400000 - 0:27:44.880000::Cancer more than you could ever believe and they like surgeries scars all over them. It's really sad, but they're like
0:27:45.800000 - 0:27:53.080000::smashing their heads into their desk like really violently as if they're like trying to knock themselves out
0:27:55.680000 - 0:28:01.360000::That's kind of the detail that I really wanted to get at was the dogs the dogs that want to go
0:28:02.320000 - 0:28:09.220000::Right those dogs are like you don't stage to like you'd be like doing a show and they would like just fucking like just
0:28:09.400000 - 0:28:11.400000::Just reaching like
0:28:12.360000 - 0:28:15.560000::Wait, I have an I.O. Story that I feel like I should tell that I think it's funny
0:28:16.240000 - 0:28:21.240000::This is a secret that I've held for far too long to keep it on topic. Oh my god. Is it about Sharner? Oh?
0:28:21.960000 - 0:28:26.120000::No, no, it's not it's about well she organized this
0:28:27.160000 - 0:28:32.280000::It's like they used to have those SNL editions that we would all do all think all all of us have done those I.O
0:28:33.800000 - 0:28:37.080000::Like eight years ago at this pre-liminary like the pre-lims
0:28:37.080000 - 0:28:39.960000::Yeah, like they would have like every year
0:28:39.960000 - 0:28:46.080000::Chicago they have like the kind of like the minor league like it's like you're not doing SNL
0:28:46.080000 - 0:28:52.160000::But it's kind of like she gets to kind of see who's out there in who she wants to like put in front of
0:28:53.160000 - 0:28:55.760000::People do it and then she'll pick like maybe like
0:28:56.200000 - 0:29:02.760000::10 people from there to go do the real showcase to do like the next step and then the next step right
0:29:03.360000 - 0:29:07.800000::But I never tell my parents like I'm auditioning for SNL like it's happening
0:29:10.440000 - 0:29:12.240000::Yeah
0:29:12.240000 - 0:29:17.200000::But mine one of the ones that I did was all it was like I was probably 23
0:29:19.120000 - 0:29:26.360000::Yeah, maybe 23 24 I had only been doing improv and I hadn't really done any like solo stuff yet really
0:29:27.360000 - 0:29:32.880000::Maybe a little tiny bit, but you have to do characters, you know, so I was so fucking nervous and I there was like
0:29:33.360000 - 0:29:36::40 guys on this list. I was number like 36
0:29:37.120000 - 0:29:39.120000::right
0:29:39.120000 - 0:29:45.240000::And I so I'm so nervous, but it's like a two hour long thing so I'm there watching the first guys going to back and out of the corner
0:29:45.240000 - 0:29:50.520000::My I can't fucking believe what I'm seeing but Jason Siddiquis is there and so is Pete Holmes
0:29:51.080000 - 0:29:55.440000::Watching this shit have I told you guys this? No, and literally I
0:29:56.360000 - 0:29:59::Like oh yeah, you have

0:30:00 - 0:30:06.880000::Really was like what the fuck is happening? I can't believe my life right now like it made me so much more nervous to the point where I was like
0:30:06.880000 - 0:30:08.880000::I can't tell the other guys is gonna like throw
0:30:08.880000 - 0:30:10.880000::Everybody off our heroes are here and
0:30:14.880000 - 0:30:17.520000::And I walked to the back to the
0:30:18.080000 - 0:30:23.120000::Green room whatever and I'm like acting weird and finally one of our friends is like dude
0:30:23.120000 - 0:30:28.640000::I never sounds like yeah, I'm all nervous like literally peoms and Jason's today because you're watching there in the back
0:30:29.600000 - 0:30:31.120000::and
0:30:31.120000 - 0:30:38.080000::But it freaked out one of my friends and then he started telling everybody else so in a matter of seconds like only a few people have gone and
0:30:38.240000 - 0:30:46.160000::So then like 20 guys 25 guys were like so nervous because they were gonna go you know audition in front of some like known
0:30:46.960000 - 0:30:48.960000::celebrity comedians
0:30:48.960000 - 0:30:53.920000::And then I'm like what the fuck I go back out there and watch and I look at the same table that had
0:30:54.720000 - 0:30:58.480000::Who I thought was Jason's today kiss and Pete Holmes at it and it's just completely
0:31:01.360000 - 0:31:07.360000::That doesn't even barely look at that but my mind had there is so funny and then frankly like that relaxed me so much
0:31:07.920000 - 0:31:15.920000::You know knowing that it wasn't them that I feel like I bodied my set but so many okay so there's a very good lesson in this what
0:31:16.400000 - 0:31:18.400000::Play dirty amazing lesson
0:31:18.720000 - 0:31:23.280000::Yes play dirty if you have a if you are in a scenario like this
0:31:23.280000 - 0:31:28.720000::Where you're doing in a prop show and or any other scenario may just win meat go ahead and say dude
0:31:29.440000 - 0:31:33.920000::I just saw Ryan locked the American vibes out there smoking a bubbler in the mother fucking
0:31:36 - 0:31:38::Oh my god, I'm so nervous aren't you
0:31:39.680000 - 0:31:42.480000::Wow joy tactics. That's amazing
0:31:43.760000 - 0:31:49.440000::Joy tactic and I genius and one time I did the IO SNL showcase I said
0:31:51.040000 - 0:31:53.040000::Instead of Jack Benzinger
0:31:53.280000 - 0:31:57.760000::I did my set back facing away from the audience. I said my name was back Benzinger
0:31:58.960000 - 0:32:00.960000::Did you crash
0:32:01.120000 - 0:32:04.480000::I can't imagine there was even enough people in the room for it to have crushed
0:32:05.440000 - 0:32:11.440000::But that was at a point when I had kind of resigned to the fact that that was not going to be my future
0:32:13.120000 - 0:32:18.160000::And I didn't want to have some fun I did a bit that you participated in there where I just like
0:32:19.040000 - 0:32:21.680000::Well, it was just like a pure like fuck you to
0:32:24.080000 - 0:32:31.920000::Just everyone, but I was like okay, so I'm gonna put hot dogs in my butt cheeks and I'm going to like
0:32:32.560000 - 0:32:36.320000::Try to carry them over and put them in this bucket of water
0:32:37.840000 - 0:32:39.840000::That was SNL yeah, yeah, yeah
0:32:41.600000 - 0:32:44.080000::And I would just put hot dogs and clench my butt cheeks
0:32:44.080000 - 0:32:50.480000::I remember that with the hot dogs and hold them and try to walk over to the next side of the stage and drop was it crushing?
0:32:50.480000 - 0:32:58::Was it absolutely crushing and actually people were having a great fucking time because everyone's doing their like they're like you know
0:32:59.120000 - 0:33:03.920000::fucking Ryan C. Crest impressions and then here comes butt butt crack
0:33:05.120000 - 0:33:07.120000::Bucket bucket of water guy
0:33:07.120000 - 0:33:09.120000::To get a big stuff you know
0:33:09.680000 - 0:33:13.680000::You've done a beautiful thing there you have really martyred yourself
0:33:14.480000 - 0:33:20.960000::For you know the Luke Knowles of the world or whoever who did end up getting it who needed that levity right?
0:33:21.760000 - 0:33:30::So you are responsible, you know for a lot of the generational talent. Don't forget to make them feel right. That's fucking right with it
0:33:31.360000 - 0:33:32.720000::I'm hungry
0:33:32.880000 - 0:33:34.880000::Wow, so you guys have never lied
0:33:35.040000 - 0:33:37.040000::Never
0:33:37.280000 - 0:33:43.360000::No, me neither yet. I have yeah, I mean either have an idea of it. Yeah, well I just thought about it
0:33:44.960000 - 0:33:48.640000::I just hold one of my values. I feel like well this is
0:33:49.600000 - 0:33:57.600000::I feel like we could dip into this but personal values are important and you need to stick to them, you know to you right
0:33:58.800000 - 0:34:00.800000::For you want what?
0:34:01.280000 - 0:34:03.840000::Maybe for you I guess
0:34:06.480000 - 0:34:08.480000::About how you rise. Yeah, yeah
0:34:09.840000 - 0:34:18.480000::Well, one of my personal values is truth and being a beacon of truth and always speaking power to our true two powers
0:34:18.480000 - 0:34:20.480000::sorry and
0:34:21.520000 - 0:34:29.600000::That's the opposite of wine. That's the opposite of secrets. So I don't hold secrets because I value truth and I stick to my values
0:34:31.760000 - 0:34:34.160000::What is okay, but what if you had to tell a lie
0:34:35.680000 - 0:34:39.760000::To save a million a million lives would you do that or would you kill them all?
0:34:40.800000 - 0:34:45.920000::Well Eric what if the lie what Eric what if the lie was that you were gonna save them?
0:34:48.400000 - 0:34:52.240000::You see where I'm saying that wow, I really knew
0:34:54.160000 - 0:34:56.480000::What do I what is that what does that mean? Oh
0:34:56.480000 - 0:34:59.840000::Oh because there's two million people okay

0:35:00 - 0:35:02.200000::One million people are standing in front of a gun
0:35:02.200000 - 0:35:05.520000::that's more powerful than a fucking atomic bomb.
0:35:05.520000 - 0:35:07.640000::Another people are standing in front of a giant laser
0:35:07.640000 - 0:35:09.600000::with the power to destroy their earth.
0:35:09.600000 - 0:35:13.040000::Okay, and in order to, they both can die,
0:35:13.040000 - 0:35:15.040000::or you can save one of the one million
0:35:15.040000 - 0:35:18.240000::by telling the other one million that you're saving them.
0:35:18.240000 - 0:35:19.320000::Remedial philosophy.
0:35:19.320000 - 0:35:20.320000::This?
0:35:20.320000 - 0:35:23::No, dude, no, it's not remedial at all.
0:35:23 - 0:35:25.080000::There's nothing remedial about me.
0:35:25.080000 - 0:35:25.880000::And I would know.
0:35:27.280000 - 0:35:29.560000::Remedial is such a mean word.
0:35:30.080000 - 0:35:30.840000::Remedial.
0:35:30.840000 - 0:35:32.320000::Yeah, I'm saying.
0:35:32.320000 - 0:35:33.600000::I didn't find it to be mean, dude.
0:35:33.600000 - 0:35:34.600000::You're acting right now.
0:35:34.600000 - 0:35:39.600000::When I was, well, remedial, let me guess, Eric.
0:35:40.160000 - 0:35:41.600000::You never took a remedial class.
0:35:41.600000 - 0:35:43.280000::I did take remedial math.
0:35:43.280000 - 0:35:45.200000::I can't wrap my head around that shit,
0:35:45.200000 - 0:35:49.080000::or I couldn't at the time until I figured it out for myself.
0:35:49.080000 - 0:35:51.680000::And now I know the numbers, but I can imagine.
0:35:52.680000 - 0:35:54.240000::You know, it is funny.
0:35:54.240000 - 0:35:59.160000::You, I think that Harvard is making a big mistake.
0:35:59.840000 - 0:36:00.520000::With what?
0:36:00.520000 - 0:36:01.360000::Here's why.
0:36:01.360000 - 0:36:02.800000::And so is MIT.
0:36:02.800000 - 0:36:04.160000::Here's why.
0:36:04.160000 - 0:36:05.800000::Because they are looking for applicants
0:36:05.800000 - 0:36:07.800000::in the future Tesla and Microsoft inventors
0:36:07.800000 - 0:36:09.800000::so that they can, what's the point of Harvard, right?
0:36:09.800000 - 0:36:12.880000::To pump people out who are going to donate back to the system.
0:36:12.880000 - 0:36:14.080000::Of course.
0:36:14.080000 - 0:36:17.880000::Now, in order to capture the Steve Jobs, what did they all do?
0:36:17.880000 - 0:36:19.480000::They didn't go to college.
0:36:19.480000 - 0:36:21.760000::They were in special needs classes.
0:36:21.760000 - 0:36:25.760000::So what they'd ought to do instead of looking at those GPAs
0:36:25.760000 - 0:36:28.080000::is go into the remedial classes,
0:36:28.080000 - 0:36:31.040000::into the special ed classes, and say,
0:36:31.040000 - 0:36:38.040000::who here is developing an invention or an app or this or that?
0:36:38.040000 - 0:36:39.640000::That's who should get into Harvard.
0:36:39.640000 - 0:36:40.920000::Mm-hmm, right.
0:36:40.920000 - 0:36:42.440000::That's right.
0:36:42.440000 - 0:36:43.600000::Wow.
0:36:43.600000 - 0:36:44.600000::That's right.
0:36:44.600000 - 0:36:46.560000::Suppose I never thought about it like that.
0:36:46.560000 - 0:36:47.080000::Wow.
0:36:47.080000 - 0:36:51.560000::Well, you can't get outside of the box from the inside of it.
0:36:51.560000 - 0:36:52.360000::Or you can't.
0:36:52.360000 - 0:36:54.240000::You see what I'm saying?
0:36:54.240000 - 0:36:57.560000::I guess you could if you opened it, but it's more
0:36:57.560000 - 0:36:59.360000::of metaphor than anything.
0:36:59.360000 - 0:37:00.360000::That would be a success.
0:37:00.360000 - 0:37:04.080000::If you just got accepted into Harvard tomorrow, would you go?
0:37:04.080000 - 0:37:06.520000::I would go right fucking now.
0:37:06.520000 - 0:37:08.120000::I put the good graduate here.
0:37:08.120000 - 0:37:11::Drawing my hair where it's receded over here.
0:37:11 - 0:37:13::I need to do that.
0:37:13 - 0:37:14.320000::Because I'm going to the dorms.
0:37:14.320000 - 0:37:16.960000::I'm going to be coming to 18 year old at the dorms.
0:37:16.960000 - 0:37:20.120000::Is it covered or is it a full ride or is it a full ride?
0:37:20.120000 - 0:37:21.320000::Yeah, it's a bit.
0:37:21.320000 - 0:37:22.960000::OK.
0:37:22.960000 - 0:37:25.040000::Full ride.
0:37:25.040000 - 0:37:25.840000::Wow.
0:37:25.840000 - 0:37:31::I'm going to Harvard and I'm joining their comedy troop
0:37:31 - 0:37:33.240000::to Red Medallions or whatever.
0:37:33.240000 - 0:37:34.680000::The what?
0:37:34.680000 - 0:37:36.640000::I don't know.
0:37:36.640000 - 0:37:38.520000::The Harvard lampoon.
0:37:38.520000 - 0:37:40.160000::Oh, yeah.
0:37:40.160000 - 0:37:43.200000::Joining that, then I'm going to become an intern at 30 Rock.
0:37:43.200000 - 0:37:45.800000::Then I'm going to start working.
0:37:45.800000 - 0:37:47.960000::I said, my whole building is excellent.
0:37:47.960000 - 0:37:48.960000::Huh?
0:37:48.960000 - 0:37:49.960000::You're coming.
0:37:49.960000 - 0:37:50.960000::Yeah.
0:37:51.640000 - 0:37:52.640000::Fully bald.
0:37:57.640000 - 0:37:58.640000::You're a page.
0:37:58.640000 - 0:37:59.640000::I did.
0:37:59.640000 - 0:38:00.160000::Yeah.
0:38:00.160000 - 0:38:02.680000::I was hoping you guys about our 30 year old roommate
0:38:02.680000 - 0:38:05.960000::that we had when I was 19 named J. Quack.
0:38:05.960000 - 0:38:07.680000::No, I don't think so.
0:38:07.680000 - 0:38:08.240000::J. Quack?
0:38:08.240000 - 0:38:10.240000::Like, K. Quack?
0:38:10.240000 - 0:38:14.040000::J. His name is J. And I guess I just said this whole fucking name.
0:38:14.040000 - 0:38:16.400000::So please don't look him up.
0:38:16.400000 - 0:38:17.760000::He was really sweet.
0:38:17.760000 - 0:38:19.880000::He lived with me in Jess.
0:38:19.960000 - 0:38:24.680000::When I was a sophomore in college, and he was kind of thinking
0:38:24.680000 - 0:38:26.800000::back on it, he may have been on the spectrum.
0:38:26.800000 - 0:38:29.200000::But we were just like, man, this guy is,
0:38:29.200000 - 0:38:31.280000::we were thought he was odd because he was 30.
0:38:31.280000 - 0:38:35.440000::We were like, man, 30 year olds are like so different.
0:38:35.440000 - 0:38:38.200000::But he was like obsessed with, you know,
0:38:38.200000 - 0:38:41.360000::thinking back on it, so much of it is coming is clear to me
0:38:41.360000 - 0:38:44.760000::now because he was obsessed with the Jeep brand.
0:38:44.760000 - 0:38:48.440000::He were like exclusively Jeep brand clothing and jackets
0:38:49.440000 - 0:38:52.360000::but he kind of did what we're talking about.
0:38:52.360000 - 0:38:54.120000::He was hella nice.
0:38:54.120000 - 0:38:56.800000::J. Did you find him through Craigslist?
0:38:56.800000 - 0:39:00.160000::No, he just said, I mean, the school put him in our room.
0:39:03.640000 - 0:39:05.200000::School put him in our room.
0:39:05.200000 - 0:39:10.200000::Like we had a little like two room dorm dormitory room.
0:39:10.200000 - 0:39:15.200000::It's not weird how like you, when you're like 18, 19,
0:39:15.480000 - 0:39:20::you're like the, somebody in their 30 seems like,
0:39:20 - 0:39:24.240000::you couldn't even imagine like, oh, I can't even possibly
0:39:24.240000 - 0:39:26.120000::picture being in my 30s.
0:39:26.120000 - 0:39:28.200000::Like that is like pathetic to think about them.
0:39:29.160000 - 0:39:30.080000::And guess what?
0:39:30.080000 - 0:39:34.680000::You know how people older they say, wow, time goes by so fast.
0:39:34.680000 - 0:39:36::It feels like yesterday I was 16.
0:39:36 - 0:39:36.840000::Yeah.
0:39:38.800000 - 0:39:41.760000::As a person into their 30s right now,
0:39:41.760000 - 0:39:44.120000::I can say that this is 100% true.
0:39:44.120000 - 0:39:46.320000::It feels like yesterday I was 22.
0:39:48.040000 - 0:39:50::Time is going by fast.
0:39:50 - 0:39:52.360000::The best days of my life when I was 22.
0:39:52.360000 - 0:39:55.520000::Psych, I fucking hated being alive back then.
0:39:58.920000 - 0:40:01::Where was everybody when they were?

0:40:00 - 0:40:06.120000::22. I'll tell you, I was in, I was a freshman in North Carolina.
0:40:06.120000 - 0:40:12.720000::So you, so you were a little older than the rest of the student body, the rest of the
0:40:12.720000 - 0:40:17.720000::freshman student body. Yeah, I was, because the world was trying to hold me back over and
0:40:17.720000 - 0:40:21.440000::over and over again. What did you do for four years after high school?
0:40:21.440000 - 0:40:27.240000::Shut up bitch. It's not why. That's not why. I was already old for my grade.
0:40:27.240000 - 0:40:32.920000::Making music videos. It may help me back because I was stupid. Then whatever graduated high school,
0:40:32.920000 - 0:40:38.440000::turning 19, yeah, I stayed in town because I knew that if I was going to go to college, I had to
0:40:38.440000 - 0:40:43.480000::prove that I was going to make a difference in the world. So I made rap videos. So wait, Jack,
0:40:43.480000 - 0:40:49.480000::for real, like, so there was like at least a two year period where you were just like living at
0:40:49.480000 - 0:40:54.040000::home, just making music videos. Like were you just doing like a lot of like? No, I wasn't.
0:40:54.040000 - 0:40:58.520000::What? What are they doing? What? A lot of drugs that they put in.
0:40:58.520000 - 0:41:02.440000::You're doing like nothing, like, like, like, absolutely nothing. Then like every so often you would
0:41:02.440000 - 0:41:07.240000::like, you'd have busted like, music video for some busted musician and DC.
0:41:07.240000 - 0:41:13.560000::And then at night, it's doing comedy sports and pro. Why are you guys saying it with a tone as
0:41:13.560000 - 0:41:18.200000::if that's not cool? Is it that's not sick? Because yeah, that is what I was doing, dude.
0:41:18.200000 - 0:41:25.080000::I was sitting around. I was caretaking my dogs for my mother and what else was I doing?
0:41:26.360000 - 0:41:31.800000::Yeah, that's about it. But guess what else? When I was out there in the real world, dude,
0:41:31.800000 - 0:41:35.880000::making music videos with the real people, I got real world experience that made me extremely
0:41:37.560000 - 0:41:41.720000::prepared for what I went to college to blow people out of the water even though I didn't graduate.
0:41:41.720000 - 0:41:44.520000::Because guess what? That's probably why I didn't graduate because I was
0:41:45.480000 - 0:41:51.080000::so far ahead of course. There's like job offers freshman year. How could this be so?
0:41:51.560000 - 0:41:55.960000::Literally, literally being a fucking PA on a hallmark film in the middle of North Carolina.
0:41:56.520000 - 0:42:02.520000::That's not something that a normal student at a normal developmental stage would be able to handle
0:42:02.520000 - 0:42:06.760000::professionally. But I'd already been doing comedy sports with people who were in their 40s
0:42:06.760000 - 0:42:11.720000::and their 50s. People who were in the real world. And I was chilling with them every night, okay?
0:42:11.720000 - 0:42:18.360000::With real people who worked for the government who like to just get a little randy on the weekend.
0:42:18.360000 - 0:42:22.920000::Randy, oh god. That's not, can we bring that to her?
0:42:22.920000 - 0:42:24.920000::Were they cheating? Were they cheating?
0:42:24.920000 - 0:42:26.920000::Yeah, getting randy? Were they cheating?
0:42:26.920000 - 0:42:32.040000::No, dude. They would go to a bar where you could smoke cigarettes in Virginia because they didn't
0:42:32.040000 - 0:42:37.640000::want to cheat. Yeah, bitch, they were cheating. Everybody cheats. If you're, if you don't have
0:42:37.640000 - 0:42:42.440000::an affair cooking right now, at least one. That's the point of getting married.
0:42:43.240000 - 0:42:47.240000::To have a little fun and just spice it up and to make, make, feel that risk again.
0:42:48.040000 - 0:42:53.320000::Yeah, that danger. What if I just, why is my heart fucking beating so strong right now?
0:42:53.320000 - 0:43:01.080000::This is not. I know, bro. Eric, go to my house right now, break in and get my blood pressure
0:43:01.080000 - 0:43:05.560000::machine and tell me that it's not 160 over 90. Is that where you're at?
0:43:06.840000 - 0:43:09.960000::No, I don't know. I'm not. I'm back down to 70 over 30.
0:43:10.680000 - 0:43:14.440000::70 over 30. Can I go back to the word randy?
0:43:14.440000 - 0:43:20.520000::Randy. I, I feel like that word. I'm going to start saying that word like way too much.
0:43:21.960000 - 0:43:24.840000::That's kind of your normal mode of operation. That's randy.
0:43:24.840000 - 0:43:27.320000::Randy. You are randy. Uh oh.
0:43:27.320000 - 0:43:29.320000::You're a randy. Randy.

0:44:29.320000 - 0:44:33.480000::Well, I'm even getting stronger, but even if I get more muscle, the more muscle I have,

0:45:44.660000 - 0:45:48.500000::She didn't realize but her family realized the year that I took her class
0:45:49.640000 - 0:45:54.480000::Oh, because you made her self-aware. I did a sort of a
0:45:55.400000 - 0:45:58.060000::Clay sculpture of a face that really
0:45:58.520000 - 0:46:00.520000::Right

0:46:09.560000 - 0:46:13.440000::a little clay tablet with a with a with a relief of a fall
0:46:14.060000 - 0:46:16.060000::scene on it
0:46:16.460000 - 0:46:18.460000::Fall trees
0:46:18.700000 - 0:46:25.980000::And I made a bookmark one time in elementary school that was so visually concerning that that my parents didn't let me enter it into the
0:46:26.100000 - 0:46:28.100000::bookmark competition. What was it?
0:46:29.060000 - 0:46:33.740000::Well, it was somebody in space who looked like they were passing away
0:46:37.220000 - 0:46:39.220000::Okay, and I thought
0:46:39.220000 - 0:46:43.640000::What I thought do they lose their space on it or it was just they did dude they did
0:46:43.640000 - 0:46:49.500000::But what I thought I thought basically I thought that effort is what made a good bookmark
0:46:49.500000 - 0:46:51.820000::And this is like a big like a huge
0:46:52.300000 - 0:46:56.020000::You know, I'm saying not a normal size bookmark is about probably foot or so tall
0:46:56.420000 - 0:46:59.520000::Yeah, and I thought that effort is what was important
0:46:59.520000 - 0:47:06.260000::So I and it was in space so I like scribbled black all over the entire thing and tried to fill it in so it looked like
0:47:07.620000 - 0:47:11.160000::Whatever well, you know children are connected to
0:47:11.860000 - 0:47:13.860000::creativity in a way that
0:47:14.220000 - 0:47:18.260000::Adults try to get they try to get back to that child like
0:47:19.260000 - 0:47:21.760000::Innocence that child like
0:47:24.100000 - 0:47:32.740000::Quality that makes you un un you know burdened by the the realities of the adult world which blocks your creativity
0:47:34.060000 - 0:47:38.940000::And sometimes that comes out in children's drawings and sometimes they're disturbing
0:47:39.740000 - 0:47:41.740000::sometimes they're
0:47:41.740000 - 0:47:44.060000::violent but we that's Randy
0:47:44.340000 - 0:47:50.900000::Yeah, well, you know why that is Nate right clear. I know it well because
0:47:52.900000 - 0:48:02.580000::Children are closest to the to the to the nebulous to yeah to what happens before what happens after they're the closest to what came before the ether as I call it
0:48:02.900000 - 0:48:04.900000::So you're saying
0:48:04.900000 - 0:48:09.860000::The ether they're like drawing crazy ass shit before we were born where I'll just like just

0:48:57.340000 - 0:49:01.660000::We're sorry, but the quality of this one was just so unreal that we don't want to
0:49:02.220000 - 0:49:08.140000::Taint it by having it go on I have something to be joy. Oh, I have something to be joyful for and I remember the name of the book
0:49:08.140000 - 0:49:11.140000::I'm reading the book I'm reading is called blind sight
0:49:11.380000 - 0:49:15.380000::It's about it's a first contact novel that defies your expectations
0:49:15.380000 - 0:49:23.100000::It was written in 2006 and yet it's touching on the future actually the current reality of AI in ways that you can't imagine
0:49:24.980000 - 0:49:28.500000::Okay, so it's so far. I'm really I'm really enthralled
0:49:28.620000 - 0:49:32.780000::But what gave me joy today? I was sitting in Manhattan in my car
0:49:34.540000 - 0:49:39.340000::Waiting for Lilla and I look outside and there's a high school field trip
0:49:40.020000 - 0:49:46.300000::Okay, the shaperones are there they're the tough guys are wearing just t-shirts too cold for that
0:49:46.300000 - 0:49:54.060000::But they don't give a fuck and in the middle of the group I spy two high school girls locked arms like arm and arm
0:49:54.060000 - 0:49:55.060000::and
0:49:55.060000 - 0:50:00.060000::Something about me had just felt like oh the youth doesn't care anymore about really come

0:50:00 - 0:50:01.660000::connecting with each other.
0:50:01.660000 - 0:50:03.560000::And seeing these two girls locked arm and arm,
0:50:03.560000 - 0:50:05.860000::it could have been like they were at a Beatles concert
0:50:05.860000 - 0:50:06.700000::in the 60s.
0:50:06.700000 - 0:50:07.860000::You know what I'm saying?
0:50:07.860000 - 0:50:09.900000::It just felt like, wow, that type of connection
0:50:09.900000 - 0:50:13.900000::is so timeless and it's so nice even in the modern age
0:50:13.900000 - 0:50:16.740000::of the internet and cell phones and whatever,
0:50:16.740000 - 0:50:18.140000::that we're still connecting in this way.
0:50:18.140000 - 0:50:19.860000::It was just a very sweet thing to see.
0:50:19.860000 - 0:50:21.620000::And they could have been the mean girls.
0:50:21.620000 - 0:50:24.300000::They could be total biatches, I don't know.
0:50:24.300000 - 0:50:27.300000::But it was awesome seeing this.
0:50:27.300000 - 0:50:29.300000::And so thank you to God for
0:50:30 - 0:50:31.400000::letting me witness that.
0:50:31.400000 - 0:50:33.160000::Now, and the men need to follow up as well.
0:50:33.160000 - 0:50:36.480000::We need the men start, need to start holding hands.
0:50:36.480000 - 0:50:38.280000::What would you do if I started holding your hand

0:50:44.240000 - 0:50:48.160000::Don't you ever touch me, touch me, hold my hand, man.
0:50:48.160000 - 0:50:49.840000::Patriots are very busy.
