0:05:37.280000 - 0:05:39.720000::I was the first person to rock a mustache and a mullet.
0:05:39.720000 - 0:05:43.320000::I think I've said that before, but I was just like kind of bored.
0:05:43.320000 - 0:05:44.640000::And I was like, you know, why not?
0:05:44.640000 - 0:05:47.480000::Let's just shave this fucking shit in right now.
0:05:47.840000 - 0:05:53.080000::Remember when Tim Allen got arrested for doing cocaine in the 70s muggle and cocaine?
0:05:53.640000 - 0:05:54.800000::That's a lot of trash.
0:05:54.800000 - 0:05:55.560000::I'm out of him.
0:05:56.040000 - 0:05:57.880000::You looked like one of his buddies.
0:05:58.720000 - 0:05:59.760000::Oh, really?
0:05:59.920000 - 0:06:02.320000::Yeah, confident something like that.
0:06:02.320000 - 0:06:03.120000::Yeah, confident.
0:06:03.760000 - 0:06:06.160000::So let's get into this thing, man.
0:06:06.160000 - 0:06:07.200000::So outer space.
0:06:07.240000 - 0:06:09.240000::When did it day first discover it?
0:06:09.840000 - 0:06:16.200000::Because the cavemen, they had a feeling that it was up there, but they weren't quite positive.
0:06:16.200000 - 0:06:18.480000::Is that something that you could well hold on?
0:06:18.480000 - 0:06:19.280000::Yeah.
0:06:19.320000 - 0:06:19.920000::Hold on.
0:06:19.920000 - 0:06:21.600000::Which cavemen are we talking about?
0:06:21.640000 - 0:06:23.400000::Because I think there was a cavemen.
0:06:24.280000 - 0:06:31.440000::We're because I think that civilization has restarted many, many, many times.
0:06:31.440000 - 0:06:33.200000::So we have gone back to cavemen.
0:06:33.200000 - 0:06:35.120000::I think a couple of times.
0:06:35.120000 - 0:06:35.640000::Oh, my God.
0:06:35.640000 - 0:06:39.800000::And so before the cavemen that we think of, yeah, I know the dinosaurs.
0:06:39.800000 - 0:06:43.080000::I know we've talked about this before, but I know the dinosaurs were typhoon on laptops.
0:06:43.640000 - 0:06:44.840000::Oh, 100%.
0:06:44.840000 - 0:06:45.080000::Yeah.
0:06:45.080000 - 0:06:46.360000::What do you say for their hooves?
0:06:46.440000 - 0:06:47.840000::What do you think a pyramid is?
0:06:47.840000 - 0:06:52.200000::A pyramid that's a, essentially, it's no coincidence to me that looks like a keyboard.
0:06:52.640000 - 0:06:54.360000::It's an ancient computer.
0:06:54.960000 - 0:06:55.440000::Right.
0:06:55.440000 - 0:06:58.080000::It's so many of these things were ancient computers.
0:06:58.080000 - 0:07:03.160000::It's so, the pyramid that were the smartest, but no, they were, they were smartest.
0:07:03.160000 - 0:07:06.080000::Well, that, that's what makes somebody dumb.
0:07:06.280000 - 0:07:09.720000::When you think you know, that's when you have no idea.
0:07:09.720000 - 0:07:11.640000::Isn't that from the real world?
0:07:11.920000 - 0:07:13.040000::It sounds like it.
0:07:13.040000 - 0:07:13.480000::Wow.
0:07:13.480000 - 0:07:14.520000::The real world.
0:07:14.720000 - 0:07:18.840000::It's, you know, I know we're a war with reality television right now with the striking
0:07:18.840000 - 0:07:23.640000::everything, but the fact that they have the real world, what, didn't they have a thing?
0:07:23.640000 - 0:07:24.600000::What, what will we do?
0:07:24.800000 - 0:07:25.080000::Wait.
0:07:26.960000 - 0:07:27.240000::What?
0:07:27.520000 - 0:07:28.560000::Don't they have a motto?
0:07:29.600000 - 0:07:29.800000::Yeah.
0:07:29.800000 - 0:07:31.960000::I just like, you know, but you have no idea.
0:07:32.160000 - 0:07:32.640000::Isn't that no?
0:07:32.640000 - 0:07:35.960000::That's, that's, that's a, uh, die, uh, true life.
0:07:35.960000 - 0:07:36.720000::I'm, or die.
0:07:36.720000 - 0:07:41.760000::That's what I say to my parents, fucking all the time that when I ask for money and they complain and they fight back.
0:07:42 - 0:07:44.520000::I said, you need to think, you know, but you have no idea what I'm going through.
0:07:44.520000 - 0:07:47.360000::You have such a bad relationship with your parents area.
0:07:47.400000 - 0:07:48.200000::I am.
0:07:48.200000 - 0:07:49.600000::Why do you just move that over?
0:07:50.480000 - 0:07:51.640000::They take advantage of them.
0:07:52.960000 - 0:07:54.560000::I do and I don't feel bad about it.
0:07:56.320000 - 0:08:03.360000::I had leech money from them and I smear their names all across the internet and you will figure out one day or
0:08:03.360000 - 0:08:07.120000::if that family is the most important thing on the planet.
0:08:07.120000 - 0:08:11.600000::And I think that I don't know how many time, how many lessons you need to learn to figure that out,
0:08:11.600000 - 0:08:14.920000::but you will, and, and it will be bad once you do.
0:08:15.040000 - 0:08:18.520000::And you will be, there will be no one left except mommy and daddy.
0:08:18.920000 - 0:08:22.960000::You know, some people have babies and they look into their baby's eyes and they go, oh,
0:08:22.960000 - 0:08:29.160000::it was that moment that I realized that my role in this life was to be protecting this kid and to be whatever.
0:08:29.640000 - 0:08:30.160000::Yeah.
0:08:30.440000 - 0:08:35.400000::That is how I feel every time I look at something I'm about to eat.
0:08:36.920000 - 0:08:37.800000::Oh my God.
0:08:37.800000 - 0:08:39.440000::The reason I put on earth.
0:08:40.120000 - 0:08:43.920000::Well, I just some interested in it and I'm feeling like purpose.
0:08:44.080000 - 0:08:44.600000::Oh.
0:08:45.280000 - 0:08:50.080000::I see when I have a baby and I see that thing, I know I'm going to go like God damn it.
0:08:50.080000 - 0:08:51.120000::Are you serious?
0:08:51.120000 - 0:08:53.280000::I got to be chill with this thing for 18 years.
0:08:53.280000 - 0:08:54.360000::Then it's goodbye forever.
0:08:54.800000 - 0:08:55.360000::You know what I mean?
0:08:55.960000 - 0:08:58.280000::I'm so I take care of myself so hard.
0:09:00 - 0:09:04.560000::I think we need to have a like, uh, we need to adopt a child.
0:09:04.560000 - 0:09:08.720000::I feel like our generation is not built to raise a child full time.
0:09:08.720000 - 0:09:13.240000::And I think we should you and your closest homies and group of friends.
0:09:13.600000 - 0:09:16.080000::I think we should raise a kid tribe style.
0:09:16.080000 - 0:09:19.960000::So one person can either get pregnant and then you just trade off the baby.
0:09:19.960000 - 0:09:24.560000::So you have a you have a kid for like, you know, three days a month.
0:09:24.680000 - 0:09:25.720000::That's so doable.
0:09:25.720000 - 0:09:28.640000::And you would give that kid everything for that fucking three days.
0:09:28.840000 - 0:09:30.720000::Oh, it's every fucking thing.
0:09:30.880000 - 0:09:36::And then you give them to the next homie and then it would just be built upon how awesome is your crew.
0:09:36 - 0:09:37.440000::And that would kind of raise the child.
0:09:37.440000 - 0:09:39.880000::And I think that's how children would be raised up.
0:09:40.080000 - 0:09:43.520000::And all those young monks, they raise those babies.
0:09:44.040000 - 0:09:45.840000::Do they really tribe style?
0:09:45.840000 - 0:09:46.280000::Yeah.
0:09:46.280000 - 0:09:46.640000::Yeah.
0:09:47.360000 - 0:09:47.640000::Trouble style.
0:09:47.640000 - 0:09:48.160000::Trilable.
0:09:48.560000 - 0:09:50.960000::Well, that you guys want to take the adoption packed with me.
0:09:51 - 0:09:51.880000::I've already taken it.
0:09:52.760000 - 0:09:53.640000::What is that?
0:09:53.960000 - 0:09:59.080000::It's I made up vow when I was 13 and someone visited our high school and gave a speech on adoption.
0:09:59.080000 - 0:10:00.040000::I vowed that I

0:10:00 - 0:10:02.480000::would be a father to the fatherless one day.
0:10:03.280000 - 0:10:07.640000::Did you really go home and say like, I'm going to fucking have an adopted kid for sure.
0:10:07.640000 - 0:10:10.240000::Right. When you hit. Hey, what's the age limit for a dog?
0:10:10.240000 - 0:10:11.760000::Can you adopt a kid when you're 18?
0:10:11.760000 - 0:10:15.240000::You can adopt a baby. Oh, when you're 18, can you adopt a baby?
0:10:16.120000 - 0:10:19.160000::Well, probably probably for the right amount of money.
0:10:19.240000 - 0:10:22.960000::I'm sure that if you had to get it, billion dollars.
0:10:23.320000 - 0:10:29.680000::Oh, if you had two billion dollars, you could, you could adopt a country for
0:10:29.680000 - 0:10:31.960000::two billion. Imagine that.
0:10:34.240000 - 0:10:38.800000::When I could see you as a dictator in one of these countries, you, you, you, you,
0:10:38.800000 - 0:10:40.840000::you make a curbing enthusiasm type show.
0:10:41.200000 - 0:10:42.760000::It blows up your beloved.
0:10:43.360000 - 0:10:46.440000::You got like my caratures before the fucking he says the thing.
0:10:46.960000 - 0:10:51.640000::And you take all that money and you go wherever to Slovenia and become
0:10:52.640000 - 0:10:55.600000::a violent. I don't know the most beloved dictator.
0:10:55.600000 - 0:10:59.640000::Oh, dude, I could see you having a 40 lane driveway.
0:10:59.960000 - 0:11:02.440000::The craziest flags all up and down it.
0:11:04.080000 - 0:11:07.720000::Fucking, what are those little lights called LCD lights of view?
0:11:07.720000 - 0:11:08.960000::Fucking like belly dancing.
0:11:08.960000 - 0:11:13.120000::I have a fucking all up and down the whole country.
0:11:13.360000 - 0:11:16.800000::And everybody's got to wake up when you wake up and you know what's
0:11:16.800000 - 0:11:19.040000::fucking pathetic? You know what is so pathetic?
0:11:19.440000 - 0:11:22.360000::What is that sounds so fucking sick to me?
0:11:22.360000 - 0:11:26.800000::I'd live there, man. If there was a Turkmenistan, but Nate's got it.
0:11:27.640000 - 0:11:29.640000::I would be the most Turkmenistan.
0:11:29.840000 - 0:11:32.520000::I would be the most benevolent dictator ever.
0:11:32.520000 - 0:11:34::What is the bottom line?
0:11:34.400000 - 0:11:37.880000::Here's the thing. You can never give me out of power ever.
0:11:38.200000 - 0:11:40.680000::You can do not un-de-throw me.
0:11:40.840000 - 0:11:44.440000::All right. But what if there was just a good dictator?
0:11:44.440000 - 0:11:45.240000::You know what I'm saying?
0:11:45.240000 - 0:11:46.840000::That's gotta be what God is.
0:11:46.840000 - 0:11:50.560000::I mean, that's that's bot a Biden is pretty much like that.
0:11:50.560000 - 0:11:52.560000::Let me start it on good dictators, man.
0:11:52.560000 - 0:11:56.760000::I feel like if Biden could go, they could let Biden cook a couple more years.
0:11:56.800000 - 0:11:58.800000::After that, that's the problem with this thing.
0:11:58.800000 - 0:12:00.880000::We only get four eight years.
0:12:01.040000 - 0:12:01.960000::Are you serious?
0:12:01.960000 - 0:12:05.480000::What could it do with 25 amazing things?
0:12:05.480000 - 0:12:06.920000::Can you give me a chance?
0:12:06.920000 - 0:12:08.680000::You can be president for as long as you want.
0:12:08.960000 - 0:12:10.840000::Didn't Roosevelt do that?
0:12:10.840000 - 0:12:13.200000::Didn't he do like four terms or something?
0:12:13.200000 - 0:12:14.440000::There are two Roosevelt's.
0:12:14.920000 - 0:12:20.120000::Jay Dillon Roosevelt shaved his head and then changed his name to Dwight D.
0:12:20.120000 - 0:12:20.840000::Eisenhower.
0:12:20.840000 - 0:12:21.960000::And then he let's get.
0:12:22.680000 - 0:12:23.680000::Let's get back to space.
0:12:23.680000 - 0:12:24.680000::Let's get back to space.
0:12:24.680000 - 0:12:25.640000::I want to say this really quick.
0:12:25.640000 - 0:12:27.640000::I want to say this really quick about the natives and dictators.
0:12:27.640000 - 0:12:28.640000::Because I don't mind.
0:12:28.640000 - 0:12:34.200000::You know how they have to put Kim Jong or whatever's picture in everybody's house.
0:12:34.200000 - 0:12:39.520000::I want native hope to say like, you know what I mean?
0:12:39.520000 - 0:12:45::Like pulling his pant panties down right above the dick indentation.
0:12:45 - 0:12:52.160000::Like I have the tightest latex fucking pants on.
0:12:52.160000 - 0:12:57.360000::And it's like it's like the photos like taken from like way below me.
0:12:57.360000 - 0:12:59.600000::And it's just everywhere.
0:12:59.600000 - 0:13:04.640000::I want to be the first ever de facto, de facto, whatever from Nate's country.
0:13:04.960000 - 0:13:07.760000::And go and go and talk about all the crazy shit that Nate does.
0:13:07.760000 - 0:13:12::You guys don't think it's all good and all belly dancing and pictures and whatnot.
0:13:12.720000 - 0:13:13.680000::He's a monster.
0:13:13.680000 - 0:13:17.040000::Dude, he figured out a way to swim on solid ground or something.
0:13:17.480000 - 0:13:20.320000::You wouldn't be able to say any of that because I would murder you.
0:13:20.320000 - 0:13:25.360000::I'm good to the people that are loyal to me, but the people that betray my trust.
0:13:25.680000 - 0:13:28.720000::They're not going to see that nice, my leveraged of myself.
0:13:28.720000 - 0:13:32.960000::No, dude, because I'd sneak out because right where you think, oh, you think you
0:13:32.960000 - 0:13:36.160000::think you just have trampolines for fun, but I'd steal one of those things and jump out
0:13:36.160000 - 0:13:37.840000::all over the wall and get out of there.
0:13:38.160000 - 0:13:38.800000::Guess what?
0:13:38.800000 - 0:13:41.560000::I put a dog collar on every person in the fucking country.
0:13:41.560000 - 0:13:45.800000::And there's like a shock thing that for dogs, except for me, I don't have the collar.
0:13:45.800000 - 0:13:47.960000::And you can't even leave the fucking country.
0:13:47.960000 - 0:13:49.640000::Well, I mean, let's, but never.
0:13:49.920000 - 0:13:54.200000::But I'm just saying, but what if that place that you were in was paradise, right?
0:13:54.840000 - 0:13:56.520000::What if it was you wouldn't want to leave?
0:13:56.520000 - 0:13:57.760000::But if you did, you can't.
0:13:58.600000 - 0:14:03.560000::Don't make me get into my real politics right now because the way I feel about dictators
0:14:03.560000 - 0:14:06.040000::is very succinct.
0:14:06.040000 - 0:14:10.680000::And I'll, I'll tell you why they're bad quickly, but I don't want to go there.
0:14:10.680000 - 0:14:11.560000::I don't want to get serious.
0:14:11.560000 - 0:14:13.800000::I don't understand why dictators are bad.
0:14:13.800000 - 0:14:16.200000::I want a dictator that's sexy as fuck.
0:14:16.200000 - 0:14:19.160000::Can you imagine the most hottest person you've ever seen saying like,
0:14:19.160000 - 0:14:20.200000::Hey, yes, all right.
0:14:20.200000 - 0:14:21.880000::There's about way less rationed.
0:14:23.720000 - 0:14:25::And I'd say no worries.
0:14:26.120000 - 0:14:29.320000::A thick ass, a fucking fat ass fucking dictator.
0:14:29.320000 - 0:14:31.640000::Dictator with the pussy tater.
0:14:31.640000 - 0:14:32.600000::The pussy tater.
0:14:32.600000 - 0:14:33.880000::Oh, just came up.
0:14:33.880000 - 0:14:34.840000::Hey, man.
0:14:34.840000 - 0:14:36.440000::Podcast episode title.
0:14:38.120000 - 0:14:39.560000::These guys are crazy, man.
0:14:39.560000 - 0:14:40.360000::Pussy taters.
0:14:40.360000 - 0:14:43.880000::This is when you say the P word and that sounds like a tater.
0:14:43.880000 - 0:14:44.840000::Tater.
0:14:44.840000 - 0:14:47.640000::My dad told me that he was listening to an episode of this.
0:14:47.640000 - 0:14:48.680000::Uh-oh.
0:14:48.680000 - 0:14:49.480000::Of my type things.
0:14:49.480000 - 0:14:53.960000::He's like, yeah, you guys just really like, you know, you go all crazy in the conversations.
0:14:55.960000 - 0:14:56.680000::Interesting.
0:14:56.680000 - 0:14:57.640000::Your dad sounds like you.
0:14:58.440000 - 0:15:00.040000::No, we're very, we're very

0:15:00 - 0:15:06::different but very similar at the same time. So let's talk about what's this episode about space.
0:15:06.800000 - 0:15:09.520000::Yeah right. So okay so it starts out.
0:15:09.520000 - 0:15:10.960000::It's covered space and whatever.
0:15:10.960000 - 0:15:15.440000::Well let's take it back to the way back right. We're all familiar with the big bang.
0:15:15.440000 - 0:15:24.240000::So this is an moment where things got so hot in one area that it caused an expansion which is
0:15:24.240000 - 0:15:31.920000::going on to this moment. It's sent rocks debris elements viable for creating gas stars and super
0:15:31.920000 - 0:15:39.680000::novas etc and which at a point came to form our earth.
0:15:39.680000 - 0:15:43.040000::Right. There were some other ones before that but they're not as important.
0:15:43.920000 - 0:15:47.200000::What they failed to mention in the schoolbooks is it's all energy right.
0:15:47.200000 - 0:15:50.640000::Right. They don't even talk about energy in school.
0:15:50.640000 - 0:15:51.120000::No no.
0:15:51.120000 - 0:15:52.240000::So fucked up.
0:15:52.240000 - 0:15:54.480000::They think people have a hard time understanding what energy is.
0:15:55.440000 - 0:15:57.840000::We are pure energy you know what I'm saying.
0:15:57.840000 - 0:16:00.160000::We are energy so we can understand that.
0:16:00.880000 - 0:16:03.520000::Well there's no such thing as a few things.
0:16:03.520000 - 0:16:08.640000::There's no such this blew my mind. I was in I'm I don't I'm sorry sorry.
0:16:10.400000 - 0:16:13.360000::Have I spoken about the sensory deprivation tank on here before?
0:16:13.360000 - 0:16:14.400000::No no no.
0:16:14.400000 - 0:16:19.840000::So in my studies of human consciousness I was in a sensory deprivation tank.
0:16:20.400000 - 0:16:25.760000::Now what I discovered is a few things which I already I knew about most of these but some of
0:16:25.760000 - 0:16:30.240000::these are my own theories. One there is no such thing as the color black.
0:16:31.280000 - 0:16:33.600000::There you can go down to gray.
0:16:34.800000 - 0:16:41.520000::It's fractal fractal the rainbows and if you close your eyes you'll see different streaks of
0:16:41.520000 - 0:16:45.600000::blue and red and purple. There's no such thing as true black that's not there's no such thing as
0:16:45.600000 - 0:16:49.360000::the true absence of light because every molecule bounces something.
0:16:50.080000 - 0:16:53.120000::The other thing is this goes for sound as well.
0:16:54.240000 - 0:16:58.480000::There's no such thing as no sound even if you get in a sensory deprivation tank what you what
0:16:58.480000 - 0:17:03.120000::you realize is you can't escape your senses which leads you to believe.
0:17:04.880000 - 0:17:08.880000::There is perhaps no such thing as nothing.
0:17:10.480000 - 0:17:13.040000::Jesus there is no nothing.
0:17:16 - 0:17:18.640000::That's pretty wild to think about actually like
0:17:20.560000 - 0:17:24.480000::Do you think if you told if you were on Joe Rogan right now and you told him this his mind would
0:17:24.480000 - 0:17:32.320000::be blown? He would take out the baddest fucking cigar on the planet and be like dude out of pure
0:17:32.320000 - 0:17:38.320000::respect. I only let certain individuals in the government even know about this cigar but I need
0:17:38.320000 - 0:17:44.720000::you to take one puff of it. This is a certain tobacco leaf that keeps you awake and around longer
0:17:44.720000 - 0:17:51.840000::than others because your brain is so valuable. Yeah I think you would have. Damn we need to be
0:17:51.840000 - 0:17:58.160000::token up some fucking cigars on this fucking podcast. What the fuck like I feel like we would be
0:17:58.160000 - 0:18:04.880000::cooking so much. Should we smoke right here? If we had a if we had a some fat fucking cigars going
0:18:06.560000 - 0:18:12.640000::Rogan style and why is it okay? So you're on this piece. Oh my god Ron White with the white
0:18:12.640000 - 0:18:18.400000::Russian dude. Oh get in drunk is fine. You know Ron White's not aliens right. He did. What?
0:18:19.360000 - 0:18:24.640000::Yeah but we won't go into that. Okay but wait Jack you're saying there's there's no thing as
0:18:24.640000 - 0:18:30.640000::absence of sound. There's no such thing as absence of sound of touch. All of your senses
0:18:32.080000 - 0:18:35.600000::even if whatever you think of black. The whole sound like.
0:18:36.400000 - 0:18:41.600000::No. Yeah it's much scarier than that. No.
0:18:45.680000 - 0:18:51.760000::I think this is how a black hole sounds like. I think it sounds like this.
0:18:51.760000 - 0:18:58.760000::I bet you a black hole sounds like this.
0:18:58.760000 - 0:18:59.760000::Help me.
0:18:59.760000 - 0:19:03.760000::I bet a black hole sounds like this.
0:19:03.760000 - 0:19:08.760000::Oh no, I bet a black hole, well Eric, go ahead.
0:19:08.760000 - 0:19:10.760000::I bet a black hole sounds like this.
0:19:10.760000 - 0:19:11.760000::Hi Chris.
0:19:11.760000 - 0:19:18.760000::No I mean, I guarantee you a black hole sounds like this for real.
0:19:18.760000 - 0:19:24.760000::Oh shit.
0:19:24.760000 - 0:19:29.760000::Oh, I'm doing the long sound, the watery monster.
0:19:29.760000 - 0:19:42.760000::Oh, if we could get into one of them black holes, if we could just get into one of them black holes, we would understand so we would end up by the way, then a totally different part of the universe, we all know their portals.
0:19:42.760000 - 0:19:45.760000::Well, let me propose something.
0:19:45.760000 - 0:19:49.760000::You're familiar with the large Hadron Collider?
0:19:49.760000 - 0:19:53.760000::But of course, where do you think I go on vacation fucking every year?
0:19:53.760000 - 0:19:55.760000::We're just getting outside the gates.
0:19:55.760000 - 0:19:56.760000::I agree.
0:19:56.760000 - 0:19:57.760000::Of course, much of us will.

0:20:00 - 0:20:01::of equations.
0:20:01 - 0:20:02::Well,
0:20:02 - 0:20:05.520000::so
0:20:05.520000 - 0:20:07.640000::look full of equations.
0:20:07.640000 - 0:20:10.120000::The his boson particle, right?
0:20:10.120000 - 0:20:11.120000::Yeah.
0:20:11.120000 - 0:20:19::Was discovered and the way that this circle thing he works is that it opens a black hole.
0:20:19 - 0:20:24.680000::Now this black hole was created on Earth in 2016.
0:20:24.680000 - 0:20:26::Right before the
0:20:26 - 0:20:29::present trumps right like this.
0:20:29 - 0:20:34.880000::Oh, is the world where we do live in a black hole and we got sucked into a universe that's
0:20:34.880000 - 0:20:38.720000::worse than death that's been painted with black.
0:20:38.720000 - 0:20:42.840000::The universe has black fingernails right now because of Donald Trump.
0:20:42.840000 - 0:20:47.200000::And there's a world where Hillary Clinton was the president outside.
0:20:47.200000 - 0:20:48.200000::Bubbles is barking him.
0:20:48.200000 - 0:20:49.200000::So sorry.
0:20:49.200000 - 0:20:51.160000::Oh, dog on the loose.
0:20:51.160000 - 0:20:54.640000::Now what's interesting about that, Nate, do you think it's possible?
0:20:54.640000 - 0:21:00.880000::Maybe this is just conspiracy minded of me that they the aliens heard us talking about
0:21:00.880000 - 0:21:05.600000::how the truth and through bubbles they created this distraction.
0:21:05.600000 - 0:21:08.920000::Oh, my goodness gracious.
0:21:08.920000 - 0:21:12.800000::And all animals are assets.
0:21:12.800000 - 0:21:18.040000::They are thinking in ways that we can't even process and we can't we're they're so ahead
0:21:18.040000 - 0:21:19.040000::of us.
0:21:19.040000 - 0:21:20.040000::You know what I'm saying?
0:21:20.040000 - 0:21:21.040000::And mind manipulation.
0:21:21.040000 - 0:21:26.160000::Well, yeah, you can process it, but you need psychedelics.
0:21:26.160000 - 0:21:28.120000::You needed to not eat for three days.
0:21:28.120000 - 0:21:29.760000::Like you just didn't ate.
0:21:29.760000 - 0:21:32.560000::Yeah, that's how you get in the right mindset to see.
0:21:32.560000 - 0:21:34.280000::Well, oh, have you heard this?
0:21:34.280000 - 0:21:38.840000::This was on this is fucking Eddie Bravo, my favorite person on the planet.
0:21:38.840000 - 0:21:41.400000::Oh, the creator of 10th planet, you just who?
0:21:41.400000 - 0:21:42.400000::Yeah.
0:21:42.400000 - 0:21:47.280000::Eddie Bravo, who is, I mean, one of the most knowledgeable people on planet Earth, I think
0:21:47.280000 - 0:21:49.800000::he might have said, wait, no, no, I don't know who fucking said this.
0:21:49.800000 - 0:21:52.160000::This was on some fucking Joe Rogan clip.
0:21:52.160000 - 0:22:00.360000::We're talking Rogan a lot on this podcast, but he said that someone said that the Nazis
0:22:00.360000 - 0:22:04.240000::would do crazy amounts of psychedelics.
0:22:04.240000 - 0:22:05.440000::Oh, this was Alex Jones.
0:22:05.440000 - 0:22:08.480000::Alex Jones said this.
0:22:08.480000 - 0:22:13.920000::Alex Jones said that the Nazis would do crazy amounts of psychedelics like a frightening
0:22:13.920000 - 0:22:18.240000::like double heroic dose style of acid.
0:22:18.240000 - 0:22:23.160000::And then they would interface with with beings with aliens, whatever.
0:22:23.160000 - 0:22:27.680000::They would interface with whatever aliens, different type of multi-dimensional creatures.
0:22:27.680000 - 0:22:31.200000::And they would give the Nazis the technology, okay?
0:22:31.200000 - 0:22:37.600000::And then the scientists would come back and create these crazy technological, technological
0:22:37.600000 - 0:22:38.600000::shits.
0:22:38.600000 - 0:22:39.600000::What?
0:22:39.600000 - 0:22:42.840000::And then they operation paperclip, they're back in the United States.
0:22:42.840000 - 0:22:45.080000::I'm not these working.
0:22:45.080000 - 0:22:46.680000::You have ever heard about this man?
0:22:46.680000 - 0:22:48.320000::The only paperclip I know is Clippy.
0:22:48.320000 - 0:22:49.320000::The little clip.
0:22:49.320000 - 0:22:51.400000::Well, we basically bought off.
0:22:51.400000 - 0:22:53::He lives with me.
0:22:53 - 0:22:56.080000::We bought the voice actor.
0:22:56.080000 - 0:22:57.080000::Huh?
0:22:57.080000 - 0:23:00.120000::No, the crazy Nazi scientists and they worked for NASA.
0:23:00.120000 - 0:23:01.120000::Well, crazy.
0:23:01.120000 - 0:23:02.120000::That's a, that's true.
0:23:02.120000 - 0:23:05.920000::Like the fucking whatever Alex Jones said is just whatever we didn't go to the moon either.
0:23:05.920000 - 0:23:07.120000::Don't, don't make me say it.
0:23:07.120000 - 0:23:08.120000::Right.
0:23:08.120000 - 0:23:09.120000::Of course not.
0:23:09.120000 - 0:23:12.320000::Listen, there's even the humanity stinks.
0:23:12.320000 - 0:23:16.320000::And there are truth people like us.
0:23:16.320000 - 0:23:21.040000::We are basically roll on the odorant for good.
0:23:21.040000 - 0:23:23.560000::We are positive roll on.
0:23:23.560000 - 0:23:24.560000::Yeah.
0:23:24.560000 - 0:23:29.600000::And they need people like us because naturally, if you let it go natural, starts to stink.
0:23:29.600000 - 0:23:31.520000::It starts to stink.
0:23:31.520000 - 0:23:32.520000::So let's see.
0:23:32.520000 - 0:23:33.520000::Big bang happens.
0:23:33.520000 - 0:23:34.520000::We get how that happened.
0:23:34.520000 - 0:23:35.520000::All right.
0:23:35.520000 - 0:23:37.520000::So then earth is formed.
0:23:37.520000 - 0:23:39.520000::These happen almost immediately.
0:23:39.520000 - 0:23:40.520000::Grass.
0:23:40.520000 - 0:23:42.520000::Over the earth.
0:23:42.520000 - 0:23:47.520000::But at which point scientists get invented and then they start detailing.
0:23:47.520000 - 0:23:48.520000::Right.
0:23:48.520000 - 0:23:49.520000::What everything is.
0:23:49.520000 - 0:23:54.720000::Well, let me say this about treasurer because this is a theory that I can't believe that
0:23:54.720000 - 0:23:58.520000::more people don't have where, you know, we think aliens are going to come in a big
0:23:58.520000 - 0:24:00.160000::shiny spaceship.
0:24:00.160000 - 0:24:04.960000::We think aliens are going to come down and be whatever Nate said, stinky little greasy
0:24:04.960000 - 0:24:07.480000::creatures that stink of a hospital.
0:24:07.480000 - 0:24:08.480000::The furry.
0:24:08.480000 - 0:24:12.480000::What is that incident called the Brazil, the Vagina.
0:24:12.480000 - 0:24:13.480000::Vagina.
0:24:13.480000 - 0:24:14.480000::Vagina.
0:24:14.480000 - 0:24:15.480000::Vagina.
0:24:15.480000 - 0:24:17.480000::Vagina, Brazil or something like that.
0:24:17.480000 - 0:24:18.480000::Vagina, Brazil.
0:24:18.480000 - 0:24:19.480000::Yeah.
0:24:19.480000 - 0:24:22.480000::But what if aliens are fucking one single plant?
0:24:22.480000 - 0:24:23.480000::You know what I'm saying?
0:24:23.480000 - 0:24:28.880000::You know, they put, you know, we think, sure, it's going to be a metal drone coming down
0:24:28.880000 - 0:24:30.880000::all starwurst out.
0:24:30.880000 - 0:24:32.960000::And inspecting, inspecting.
0:24:32.960000 - 0:24:37.280000::What if the drone is the fucking tree that you climbed down as a kid?
0:24:37.280000 - 0:24:38.280000::You know what I'm saying?
0:24:38.280000 - 0:24:42.680000::And it has a whole network with the other trees and inspecting us until reporting back
0:24:42.680000 - 0:24:44.960000::to me, me sending signals back to space.
0:24:44.960000 - 0:24:46.960000::Well, that would be great, man.
0:24:46.960000 - 0:24:47.960000::You know what I'm saying?
0:24:47.960000 - 0:24:48.960000::Why?
0:24:48.960000 - 0:24:49.960000::Of course.
0:24:49.960000 - 0:24:54::Well, maybe a tree isn't a tree could be an alien, but it better hope it's not an alien.
0:24:54 - 0:24:56.880000::Do you think that it was planted was seeded by another civilization?
0:24:56.880000 - 0:24:58.200000::It was seeded by somebody.
0:24:58.200000 - 0:24:59.200000::Somebody seeded it.
0:24:59.200000 - 0:25:00.200000::It's obviously a seed.

0:25:00 - 0:25:01::It's the shape of a seed.
0:25:01 - 0:25:02.560000::It's never clearly been more of a seed.
0:25:02.560000 - 0:25:05.520000::And things are sprouting out of it like as a seed does.
0:25:05.520000 - 0:25:06.360000::Yeah, yeah, yeah.
0:25:06.360000 - 0:25:08.360000::And the seeds inside the seeds.
0:25:08.360000 - 0:25:09.640000::It's a multi layer seed.
0:25:09.640000 - 0:25:10.480000::And guess what?
0:25:10.480000 - 0:25:11.880000::Everybody watch out.
0:25:11.880000 - 0:25:13.920000::I just invented a new fucking theory.
0:25:13.920000 - 0:25:15.280000::The earth is a seed.
0:25:15.280000 - 0:25:17.640000::I know I've already invented human seed theory.
0:25:17.640000 - 0:25:18.720000::This is now earth seed.
0:25:18.720000 - 0:25:19.560000::Right.
0:25:19.560000 - 0:25:21.960000::And that molten thing inside of there,
0:25:21.960000 - 0:25:24.680000::we don't have the right X-ray to see in there.
0:25:24.680000 - 0:25:27.840000::But what if there is a giant human fetus?
0:25:27.840000 - 0:25:29.360000::Oh shit.
0:25:29.360000 - 0:25:32.720000::You live on the egg getting ready to come out of the magma.
0:25:32.720000 - 0:25:35.560000::And one day, cabin in the wood style.
0:25:35.560000 - 0:25:36.560000::You can get the losses.
0:25:36.560000 - 0:25:37.960000::Is going to come out of the tree.
0:25:37.960000 - 0:25:38.960000::Oh my.
0:25:38.960000 - 0:25:40.240000::Straight out of Bangladesh.
0:25:40.240000 - 0:25:41.240000::Oh, yeah.
0:25:41.240000 - 0:25:42.240000::Out of the heat.
0:25:42.240000 - 0:25:43.240000::That's the main.
0:25:43.240000 - 0:25:47.280000::Yeah, because that's the direct center of the universe
0:25:47.280000 - 0:25:48.760000::of the antipode.
0:25:48.760000 - 0:25:49.600000::It's the two antipode.
0:25:49.600000 - 0:25:50.400000::Well, Bangladesh will be ready.
0:25:50.400000 - 0:25:51.560000::I know they've been working.
0:25:51.560000 - 0:25:54.080000::Yeah, that was the capital.
0:25:54.080000 - 0:25:56.880000::Baku, no, DACA.
0:25:56.880000 - 0:25:57.680000::It's not important.
0:25:57.680000 - 0:25:58.800000::We need to go.
0:25:58.800000 - 0:26:00.640000::We need to go to Bangladesh.
0:26:00.640000 - 0:26:02.360000::We have, we've looked at the numbers.
0:26:02.360000 - 0:26:04.200000::And I just want to say hello, Bangladesh.
0:26:04.200000 - 0:26:05.440000::We see you.
0:26:05.440000 - 0:26:08.240000::We thank you for rocking with us for this long.
0:26:08.240000 - 0:26:09.440000::We are seeing the numbers.
0:26:09.440000 - 0:26:12.440000::And we're seeing the country's number one is obviously Canada
0:26:12.440000 - 0:26:13.640000::in the United States.
0:26:13.640000 - 0:26:15.960000::Number three, Bangladesh.
0:26:15.960000 - 0:26:17.840000::Thank you guys for rocking with us.
0:26:17.840000 - 0:26:20.240000::And India rocks with us so intensely.
0:26:20.240000 - 0:26:24.520000::India, a lot of the Southeast Asian countries are fucking.

0:26:52.080000 - 0:26:52.920000::No, we don't.
0:26:52.920000 - 0:26:53.920000::Right.
0:26:53.920000 - 0:26:54.920000::I offended me.
0:26:54.920000 - 0:26:55.920000::Yeah.
0:26:55.920000 - 0:26:56.920000::Yeah.
0:26:56.920000 - 0:27:00.880000::And okay, so let's, let's get into gravity.
0:27:00.880000 - 0:27:03.120000::As gravity works, it's so simple.
0:27:03.120000 - 0:27:07.440000::You have something large enough.
0:27:07.440000 - 0:27:13.360000::You have something so large that what it does is that it sucks up on things around it.
0:27:13.360000 - 0:27:15.320000::It's stuck and upon everything in the universe.
0:27:15.320000 - 0:27:23.520000::So imagine that you had a 20 pound weight and you dropped it on.
0:27:23.520000 - 0:27:25.960000::Oh, uh, something.
0:27:25.960000 - 0:27:26.960000::Yeah.
0:27:26.960000 - 0:27:27.960000::Yeah.
0:27:27.960000 - 0:27:29.520000::No, we did you dropped it.
0:27:29.520000 - 0:27:33.880000::You know, well, that's going to fall down because there are that's gravity.
0:27:33.880000 - 0:27:35.680000::And gravity doesn't just exist physically.
0:27:35.680000 - 0:27:38.120000::It also exists spiritually.
0:27:38.120000 - 0:27:42.600000::And you have to be careful because let me tell you this.
0:27:42.600000 - 0:27:44.480000::I have gravity, right?
0:27:44.480000 - 0:27:48.600000::I have gravity that draws people to me because of my charisma.
0:27:48.600000 - 0:27:53::But for every person that is drawn to you and has a crush on you, you also draw
0:27:53 - 0:27:54::enemies.
0:27:54 - 0:27:55::Right.
0:27:55 - 0:28:01.120000::Well, because the more dense your orbit, I mean, the more dense of a structure you have
0:28:01.120000 - 0:28:03.920000::internally, the crazier orbit you have, right?
0:28:03.920000 - 0:28:04.920000::Yeah.
0:28:04.920000 - 0:28:07.840000::So when I first moved to New York, I had no, I had no density.
0:28:07.840000 - 0:28:12.120000::I had nothing to, nothing of offer because I didn't have no followers online.
0:28:12.120000 - 0:28:13.840000::And nobody gave a fuck about me.
0:28:13.840000 - 0:28:14.840000::Right.
0:28:14.840000 - 0:28:15.840000::Uh oh, 10,000 followers.
0:28:15.840000 - 0:28:17.840000::Hey, Eric, good to see you as 20,000.
0:28:17.840000 - 0:28:18.840000::Oh, oh, snap.
0:28:18.840000 - 0:28:20.640000::You like free drinks, right?
0:28:20.640000 - 0:28:21.640000::30,000.
0:28:21.640000 - 0:28:23.440000::My mom offers from my counselor to come in.
0:28:23.440000 - 0:28:28.140000::So you get crazy people in your orbit, the more dense and interesting you become and
0:28:28.140000 - 0:28:32.260000::more gravity you have, the more crazy orbit gets, and you gotta watch out because there are
0:28:32.260000 - 0:28:36.280000::fucking evil aliens that are gonna compris your orbit with you.
0:28:36.280000 - 0:28:38.440000::And you have to be strong for that.
0:28:38.440000 - 0:28:39.440000::You know what I'm saying?
0:28:39.440000 - 0:28:40.440000::Me.
0:28:40.440000 - 0:28:41.240000::Hey, people come out.
0:28:41.240000 - 0:28:44.040000::Well, yeah, maybe not.
0:28:44.040000 - 0:28:48.360000::What's funny is when you call somebody dense, that means that they're stupid, but actually
0:28:48.360000 - 0:28:52.880000::saying that is stupid right this is what I think now well we're changing
0:28:52.880000 - 0:28:58.280000::this person is so smart words and linguistics are changing rapidly and I feel
0:28:58.280000 - 0:29:02.960000::like we are at the frontier of kind of linguistics and what certain words
0:29:02.960000 - 0:29:07.620000::mean and what they're changing to be you know what I'm saying because back in
0:29:07.620000 - 0:29:12.080000::the 20s people said they were gay and not meant like jolly it's
0:29:12.080000 - 0:29:16.040000::stuff and now that word you know means a different thing you know I'm saying
0:29:16.040000 - 0:29:20.440000::something very different so there's there's it's gonna be something entirely
0:29:20.440000 - 0:29:24.880000::different right we were talking about this because we well we don't we don't
0:29:24.880000 - 0:29:29.800000::like to brag about this but we say words so differently all three of us and we
0:29:29.800000 - 0:29:33.520000::are we've noticed have been kind of the inception of a lot of these words
0:29:33.520000 - 0:29:37.240000::that have become very popular right we start saying in our private friend
0:29:37.240000 - 0:29:41.960000::circle and then whoa did I hear something on Bobby Lee's podcast someone mentioned
0:29:41.960000 - 0:29:45.800000::yeah it goes out of our orbit so quick so we want to do an experiment
0:29:45.800000 - 0:29:49.960000::we're what was the word that we were gonna use oh what was it it was
0:29:49.960000 - 0:29:55.480000::toe no toe was no was missed missed oh missed
0:29:55.480000 - 0:30:00.040000::is that right oh shit okay okay so misty what is misty

0:30:00 - 0:30:02.560000::So like any of them, I'm missed it right now.
0:30:02.560000 - 0:30:05.400000::That kind of, okay, flows out into the ether.
0:30:05.400000 - 0:30:07.840000::Misty has to mean many different things,
0:30:07.840000 - 0:30:12.040000::but what it can mean is, bam, down, Jack,
0:30:12.040000 - 0:30:14.160000::you looking misty today.
0:30:14.160000 - 0:30:17.040000::Mist, dog, you looking fresh.
0:30:17.040000 - 0:30:20.520000::I'm having a good day today on Mist.
0:30:20.520000 - 0:30:21.680000::Yes.
0:30:21.680000 - 0:30:22.520000::Yeah, yeah.
0:30:22.520000 - 0:30:24.080000::So you can use it in a lot of different ways,
0:30:24.080000 - 0:30:24.920000::you know what I'm saying?
0:30:24.920000 - 0:30:26.560000::That Misty can mean cool.
0:30:26.560000 - 0:30:29.960000::Misty can mean, you have a lot of things
0:30:29.960000 - 0:30:32.440000::that you're really liking what's going on.
0:30:32.440000 - 0:30:34.080000::You know, that was Misty.
0:30:34.080000 - 0:30:34.920000::That was Misty.
0:30:34.920000 - 0:30:35.920000::Incredibly Misty.
0:30:35.920000 - 0:30:38.560000::Misty can also mean something horrible is happening.
0:30:38.560000 - 0:30:42.560000::You walk into a room and a horrible killing has occurred
0:30:42.560000 - 0:30:45.560000::and you go and you've never seen destruction like that before.
0:30:45.560000 - 0:30:47.240000::You come out, you someone says, what's wrong?
0:30:47.240000 - 0:30:49.560000::You said, it's Misty, dude, don't ask me that.
0:30:49.560000 - 0:30:50.400000::It's Misty.
0:30:50.400000 - 0:30:51.720000::Yeah, it's Misty, man.
0:30:51.720000 - 0:30:53.360000::Misty, yeah, yeah.
0:30:53.360000 - 0:30:55.760000::Misty, ooh, that could be kind of the root.
0:30:55.760000 - 0:30:58.040000::Right, you think it means like the wet rain,
0:30:58.040000 - 0:30:59.160000::but it doesn't, it means Misty.
0:30:59.160000 - 0:31:00::Misty, oh.
0:31:00 - 0:31:00.840000::Misty, oh.
0:31:00.840000 - 0:31:01.680000::Misty, oh.
0:31:01.680000 - 0:31:03::Misty, cow.
0:31:03 - 0:31:03.840000::Misty.
0:31:03.840000 - 0:31:04.680000::Misty, oh.
0:31:04.680000 - 0:31:06.160000::So anyways, back to space.
0:31:07.200000 - 0:31:08.320000::Now what is in space?
0:31:08.320000 - 0:31:10.680000::We know that we're in space.
0:31:10.680000 - 0:31:12.560000::We know that there are other rocks
0:31:12.560000 - 0:31:14.520000::all around the Frickin universe,
0:31:14.520000 - 0:31:16.360000::dot around, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
0:31:16.360000 - 0:31:20.160000::And then those rocks are all floating around
0:31:20.160000 - 0:31:24.840000::what we call hot buckets of energy, Aka stars.
0:31:24.840000 - 0:31:26.440000::Now what is a star?
0:31:26.440000 - 0:31:31.440000::Well, a star is out.
0:31:31.440000 - 0:31:32.440000::A star?
0:31:32.440000 - 0:31:34.040000::No, no, no, no, no.
0:31:34.040000 - 0:31:35.600000::Try, wait, wait, wait.
0:31:35.600000 - 0:31:37.240000::What is your best assumption?
0:31:37.240000 - 0:31:38.480000::You know the star is, man.
0:31:38.480000 - 0:31:39.720000::I don't want to hear that.
0:31:39.720000 - 0:31:43::OK, so Big Bang happens that all the energy has to go somewhere
0:31:43 - 0:31:45.360000::and guess what energy likes to pull up and be friends
0:31:45.360000 - 0:31:46.960000::with each other.
0:31:46.960000 - 0:31:49::So some of the energy goes into rocks,
0:31:49 - 0:31:51.160000::some of the energy goes into blank space,
0:31:51.160000 - 0:31:55.800000::some of the energy gets all coiled up and gets put into a ball.
0:31:55.840000 - 0:31:57.800000::We call those hot stars.
0:31:57.800000 - 0:31:58.760000::And guess what that is?
0:31:58.760000 - 0:32:02.040000::That's gas that just won't stop burning.
0:32:02.040000 - 0:32:06.040000::And there's pretty much the dwarves.
0:32:06.040000 - 0:32:07.240000::There's supernovas.
0:32:07.240000 - 0:32:09.920000::Supernovas, which is that's when they explode
0:32:09.920000 - 0:32:12::because everything has a time limit.
0:32:12 - 0:32:13.680000::It's forever.
0:32:13.680000 - 0:32:16.840000::And then you got our regular suns, which is like what we have.
0:32:16.840000 - 0:32:20.640000::And what they do is they put off light heat,
0:32:20.640000 - 0:32:23.880000::all of which are energy in different forms of waves,
0:32:23.880000 - 0:32:28.520000::everything on the universe is waves.
0:32:28.520000 - 0:32:32::Jack Johnson was a surfer before he was a musician.
0:32:32 - 0:32:33.880000::I don't know why I said that.
0:32:33.880000 - 0:32:39.320000::But yeah.
0:32:39.320000 - 0:32:40.800000::Yeah.
0:32:40.800000 - 0:32:41.800000::I'm sorry.
0:32:41.800000 - 0:32:42.320000::I got mad.
0:32:42.320000 - 0:32:42.800000::Misty.
0:32:42.800000 - 0:32:43.800000::What?
0:32:43.800000 - 0:32:45.120000::I'm getting misty too.
0:32:45.120000 - 0:32:47.040000::Think just thinking about all this shit.
0:32:47.040000 - 0:32:51.440000::But what we're trying to say is space is so large.
0:32:51.440000 - 0:32:53.800000::And it's so very interesting.
0:32:53.800000 - 0:32:59.200000::And it's a constant reminder of our place in life,
0:32:59.200000 - 0:33:02.960000::our place in the universe, because you can get all tripped up
0:33:02.960000 - 0:33:05.920000::about whatever getting laid off from your job, which
0:33:05.920000 - 0:33:06.520000::got from it.
0:33:06.520000 - 0:33:10.240000::I hope it happens to no one else because it's ruining my life.
0:33:10.240000 - 0:33:13.640000::You could get all tripped up about whatever, your mom or dad
0:33:13.640000 - 0:33:15.720000::passing away.
0:33:15.720000 - 0:33:16.960000::Then you look up in a space.
0:33:16.960000 - 0:33:18.280000::You see the stars.
0:33:18.280000 - 0:33:19.560000::You see Mars.
0:33:19.560000 - 0:33:22.080000::You see the moon, which we don't think anybody's actually
0:33:22.080000 - 0:33:22.360000::been to.
0:33:22.360000 - 0:33:23.360000::That was all I.
0:33:23.400000 - 0:33:24.920000::I know no one's been there.
0:33:24.920000 - 0:33:28.560000::And you realize, like, God damn, this, my shit doesn't mean a damn
0:33:28.560000 - 0:33:29.320000::ass thing.
0:33:29.320000 - 0:33:31.440000::And that's actually empowering.
0:33:31.440000 - 0:33:35.720000::It's empowering to know that everything is bigger than you.
0:33:35.720000 - 0:33:37.880000::So everybody just look into the stars at night.
0:33:37.880000 - 0:33:41.200000::If you're not in the light polluted location, just look out
0:33:41.200000 - 0:33:45.360000::focus on one star and think, thank God, whatever.
0:33:45.360000 - 0:33:46.520000::My life is so miniscule.
0:33:46.520000 - 0:33:47.520000::It doesn't mean a damn thing.
0:33:47.520000 - 0:33:49::And I mean,
0:33:49 - 0:33:50.360000::imagine this.
0:33:50.360000 - 0:33:51.360000::Imagine this.
0:33:51.760000 - 0:33:53.680000::What would you do in this scenario?
0:33:53.680000 - 0:33:55.040000::Nate, let me ask you this.
0:33:55.040000 - 0:33:55.880000::Okay.
0:33:55.880000 - 0:34:01::So you're walking down the street and a fucking dog comes and bites you
0:34:01 - 0:34:04.600000::on the fucking leg and you fall over in your ankle snaps and half
0:34:04.600000 - 0:34:06.960000::and this dog's biting on your fucking shit.
0:34:06.960000 - 0:34:08.080000::And you can't hardly walk.
0:34:08.080000 - 0:34:09.320000::And you start nuttin' out of control.
0:34:09.320000 - 0:34:10.160000::You don't know why.
0:34:10.160000 - 0:34:12.400000::You won't know all the vibrate in your ass.
0:34:12.400000 - 0:34:13.400000::Yeah.
0:34:15.160000 - 0:34:16::Okay.
0:34:16 - 0:34:20.240000::So then, I would love to for myself to find like amazing fucking
0:34:20.240000 - 0:34:23.360000::like little fetish that I had no idea even had in the first place
0:34:23.360000 - 0:34:24.360000::like that.
0:34:24.360000 - 0:34:25.200000::That would be so incredible.
0:34:25.200000 - 0:34:26.200000::And by the way, it doesn't have to be an animal.
0:34:26.200000 - 0:34:28.240000::That could be a metal trap that closes on you.
0:34:28.240000 - 0:34:29.080000::What a ride.
0:34:29.080000 - 0:34:30.080000::The point is,
0:34:30.080000 - 0:34:31.680000::the point is,
0:34:31.680000 - 0:34:36.440000::the point is your leg, your foot fucking snaps off.
0:34:36.440000 - 0:34:37.360000::Okay.
0:34:37.360000 - 0:34:38.360000::Okay.
0:34:38.360000 - 0:34:39.200000::And you're sitting there,
0:34:39.200000 - 0:34:40.040000::you're riding in pain,
0:34:40.040000 - 0:34:40.880000::you're about to pass out.
0:34:40.880000 - 0:34:42.200000::You can't believe it.
0:34:42.200000 - 0:34:43::And you think,
0:34:43 - 0:34:45.280000::God damn it, my life can't get any fucking worse.
0:34:45.280000 - 0:34:48.280000::All of a sudden, somebody on fire comes running down the street.
0:34:49.280000 - 0:34:51.040000::They're all burning.
0:34:51.040000 - 0:34:52.560000::It's all to have fucking hell.
0:34:52.560000 - 0:34:54.440000::And they fucking get put out somehow.
0:34:54.440000 - 0:34:56.120000::Some fucking dumpster falls on them.
0:34:56.120000 - 0:34:58.120000::All nasty as liquid puts them out.
0:34:58.120000 - 0:35:00.080000::And they come and they fall down the hill right.

0:35:00 - 0:35:04.560000::next to you and this fucking charred person comes to lies down on the floor and all of a sudden you're
0:35:04.560000 - 0:35:10.240000::looking at your ankle and you're going doesn't really hurt. Oh because I was wondering where you're going
0:35:10.240000 - 0:35:15.920000::with this. Okay, I see now because it could be worse. There could I could okay. I know that person's
0:35:15.920000 - 0:35:21.600000::looking at your busted leg and thinking I wish I had that. Yeah. And then and then they're sitting
0:35:21.600000 - 0:35:27.360000::there all charred up. Oh god damn it. I'm all burnt shit. Not again. And what did they see? They
0:35:27.360000 - 0:35:33.920000::see someone flying down from the sky at two billion miles an hour as fast as can be. And that
0:35:33.920000 - 0:35:40.160000::person is flying into a nest of porky pines. And those porky pines have whatever poit the most
0:35:40.160000 - 0:35:45.920000::painful poison all littered upon the needles. And that poison burns you from within. And so then they
0:35:45.920000 - 0:35:51.360000::see this person that's busted onto the porky pines and whatever. And now they're laying there.
0:35:51.440000 - 0:35:58.240000::And that person's saying thank god I got just burnt. And then and then that person
0:35:59.280000 - 0:36:04::followed all the porky pines from space sees Ted Cruz's ugly. Oh,
0:36:07.840000 - 0:36:12.640000::we can't help but get political. Did we just invite the Republicans to the barbecue right now?
0:36:12.640000 - 0:36:18.480000::Oh, I think we are about to get barbecued. So we can't help but go after their asses.
0:36:18.480000 - 0:36:24.800000::So Republicans, I have some I have a question for you. Uh, why does your brain look more like a
0:36:24.800000 - 0:36:31.200000::Frito? I bet. And I'm pink whatever muscle. Yeah, we all have. Yeah. Look like a.
0:36:31.200000 - 0:36:38.080000::All right. I got a question for Republicans. How come whatever? When I go and look at the ugly ass
0:36:38.080000 - 0:36:44.960000::lizards at the zoo? Why come? I think I see you in there sometimes this lizard around.
0:36:45.680000 - 0:36:52.640000::Yeah, damn, we need to be in we need to go to Congress. I need to go to the risk because I got
0:36:52.640000 - 0:36:58.560000::I'm so kind. I can't think of a good one. I just thought of something based on the the person on fire.
0:37:00.560000 - 0:37:10.080000::Do you think I should self emulate at a picket? Oh, you like a lot. Yeah, like like myself on fire
0:37:10.560000 - 0:37:19.040000::right. Or strike in front of Netflix. If you would be like, whoa, it's not that like, yo, yeah, it's like not that crazy.
0:37:19.040000 - 0:37:24.320000::Like people are trying to like use their picket signs to like put me out and shit. David's love.
0:37:29.920000 - 0:37:36.240000::Smartly showed up. Oh my god. I might have to come down to that. Do you think that would change
0:37:36.320000 - 0:37:38.720000::that would that would change something. Do you think we come to a deal?
0:37:39.200000 - 0:37:45.040000::Married yourself like that. Yeah, something would fucking change. But it would be bad if you got
0:37:45.040000 - 0:37:52.400000::the wrong location and you did it anyways. Yeah. I just did out front of a random building.
0:37:52.400000 - 0:37:59.120000::Like, there's nobody picketing like, I don't know if you should do self emulation in
0:37:59.760000 - 0:38:06::L.A. either because of the wildfires. Like, you might end the entire city.
0:38:06.560000 - 0:38:10.280000::Of L.A. And you know, the sun's so hot that you'd be extrovert. You get a
0:38:10.280000 - 0:38:16.400000::number of times. The self emulate. Am I saying that right? Emulation. Emulation.
0:38:16.400000 - 0:38:20.400000::It's not going to bite like it sounds like an emulator. I don't know. I don't even know if I'm
0:38:21.360000 - 0:38:27.040000::left out, but no, I think it's immolate. Isn't that one of the worst ways to like the most
0:38:27.040000 - 0:38:33.760000::painful death is to say, but we can't do self-unfiring. We should though. You could while they're
0:38:33.760000 - 0:38:37.360000::doing it. No one just has. What? Can we change one? What is that? What is that?
0:38:37.360000 - 0:38:38.960000::One done a quick, quick, quick, quick. How bad is it?
0:38:39.840000 - 0:38:44.320000::Well, whenever we go to the hospital, you get that test that says, which I don't go off
0:38:44.320000 - 0:38:48.400000::from because I'm healthy. It says how, you know, one to ten, how depressed are you? This is that.
0:38:48.400000 - 0:38:52.320000::There should be one to ten. How much pain are you in? And then a little paragraph we could
0:38:52.320000 - 0:38:56.880000::write about it. They because they always give me the form where you can just circle a thing.
0:38:56.880000 - 0:39:02.400000::I always go about like it's far to the left of the page past the little scale. And I draw the
0:39:02.400000 - 0:39:09.840000::most fucked up drawing of a me related smiley face. I remember an ear infection every time it's
0:39:10.480000 - 0:39:14.800000::20 out of fucking ten level of pain. You can't. Yeah.
0:39:16.800000 - 0:39:24.640000::What? You know what? Back to back to space, I did want to float this this theory. So we were talking
0:39:24.640000 - 0:39:33.040000::about, you know, the vastness of space. It expands to infinity, right? Like there's no end to space.
0:39:33.040000 - 0:39:37.920000::There's no, there's no like, you know, orb that when you get to it, you knock on a glass thing.
0:39:37.920000 - 0:39:42.400000::You're like, damn, I reached the end of this shit. There isn't. I don't believe that. I don't.
0:39:42.400000 - 0:39:50::I don't think. I think. Here's what I think, man. I think that space is truly infinite.
0:39:50.560000 - 0:39:57.520000::And I think that there has been an infinite amount of big bangs that have happened.
0:39:57.520000 - 0:39:59.920000::And you know how space is expanding?

0:40:00 - 0:40:14::expanding, expanding, expanding, yeah, over an infinity of time, eventually, it's going to expand so much that there's nothing there and that vacuum that is there if it's big enough, it creates another big bang.
0:40:14 - 0:40:21::And then the same exact instances that occurred, the same is that that's what a parallel reality is.
0:40:22 - 0:40:24::That's my busted layman theory.
0:40:24 - 0:40:31::Well, let me go off this. Do you think that there are beings and creatures that exist so interdimensional? Right?
0:40:31 - 0:40:41::Yeah, we are so tied to our dimension, just like if you drew a stick figure on a piece of paper, he's stuck in his 2D world. All he knows is his 2D world.
0:40:41 - 0:40:48::If he got out of there, he wouldn't even know the fucking think of all this 3D. He couldn't believe it. He doesn't have eyes built for it. Right?
0:40:48 - 0:41:00::But there has been a being that misbehaved badly in the interdimensional reality, the fifth dimension, whatever, and who is sentenced to a horrible life in a third dimension body.
0:41:00 - 0:41:05::You're talking about yourself there. That's us. That is the universe.
0:41:05 - 0:41:07::Let me out! Let me out!
0:41:08 - 0:41:10::Well, here's what's funny is...
0:41:13 - 0:41:24::It's kind of like going out of bounds. When you go out of bounds in a video game and it starts to get all fuzzy, that's because the designers of the game don't want you to see the code.
0:41:24 - 0:41:30::You're not allowed to go outside of the boundary. But when it's similarly, it takes going to that place.
0:41:30 - 0:41:39::When you start to push and take psychedelics and push past that boundary, it starts to get fuzzier and weirder. Why is that? Because that's where the coding lies.
0:41:39 - 0:41:40::Glitch.
0:41:40 - 0:41:41::Yes.
0:41:41 - 0:41:45::Would you do a Horoag Dose on the podcast, please? I know you guys are talking about this.
0:41:45 - 0:41:48::Yes. But would you do a non-racist Horoag Dose?
0:41:48 - 0:41:52::Would you be afraid of the machine elves to better everybody instead of ruling everybody?
0:41:52 - 0:42:04::I would love to because I feel like everyone who does this is trying to gain technology. They're going to these machine elves and the alien creatures too for such selfish reasons.
0:42:04 - 0:42:11::We want you to give us the technology to invent the App Store on Apple or something like that.
0:42:11 - 0:42:19::We have these Silicon Valley execs taking Horoag Doses who are coming back with fiber optic cables and stuff like that.
0:42:19 - 0:42:24::I would just go there and just kick it and who knows what kind of information I get there.
0:42:24 - 0:42:30::You know, you got to know, yeah, you got to go to the different elves because they're getting technology.
0:42:30 - 0:42:31::Right.
0:42:31 - 0:42:35::They keep going to the machine elves. You got to go there and say like, yo, where's the food elves?
0:42:35 - 0:42:40::Where's the good, where's the, yeah, where's the whatever exercise?
0:42:40 - 0:42:41::Right.
0:42:41 - 0:42:42::And get that.
0:42:42 - 0:42:48::What if Nate you went in there with an ask him for an idea for a TV show like he wants to go to God's for an idea.
0:42:48 - 0:42:54::And you come back with the idea for a TV show that's about a bus driver with OCD.
0:42:54 - 0:42:57::It's like a closed the.
0:42:57 - 0:43:00::And that's the main all the corporate enthusiasm.
0:43:00 - 0:43:04::A bus driver with OCD.
0:43:04 - 0:43:05::Yeah.
0:43:05 - 0:43:10::Hey, nobody, uh, nobody hit the stop button at a loremer street.
0:43:10 - 0:43:15::Well, sorry, why are you stopping? Well, I got to you.
0:43:15 - 0:43:16::You don't understand.
0:43:16 - 0:43:23::If I don't stop it every single stop along the way, what's going to happen is 9 11 except instead of hitting the tower.
0:43:23 - 0:43:26::The plane's going to hit the earth and the whole earth is going to blow up.
0:43:26 - 0:43:29::That's what happens to play and hits the ground.
0:43:29 - 0:43:31::That would be not cool.
0:43:31 - 0:43:38::Macklemore would never write a song about something like that happening because he doesn't write about unless it was a song about healing.
0:43:38 - 0:43:43::Can we pay Macklemore to write about some shit that needs fixing or what?
0:43:43 - 0:43:50::Because there's hungry people in the world because there's people who are itchy beyond our possible imagination.
0:43:50 - 0:43:56::Y'all couldn't imagine what it's like to be as itchy as some people in the world are every day.
0:43:56 - 0:43:58::People are itchy.
0:43:58 - 0:44:00::People are itching.
0:44:00 - 0:44:03::People are surrounded by bugs that got something to push every day.
0:44:03 - 0:44:05::You think bugs in America are bad?
0:44:05 - 0:44:07::Funny.
0:44:07 - 0:44:10::You gotta get Macklemore to do whatever.
0:44:10 - 0:44:15::If you were going to do heroic dose, he's got to do like the legendary epic superhero crazy.
0:44:15 - 0:44:17::S tier dose.
0:44:17 - 0:44:24::S tier dose and he's got to do it on an inversion table live on an inversion table.
0:44:24 - 0:44:26::Like stress.
0:44:26 - 0:44:28::I'll tell you what.
0:44:28 - 0:44:32::If I do a heroic dose, you better fucking strap me into something.
0:44:32 - 0:44:38::You better fucking restrain me because I don't want to know what I'm going to be swinging through and hands.
0:44:38 - 0:44:40::We're going to choke you out.
0:44:40 - 0:44:42::We're going to have you.
0:44:42 - 0:44:45::I'm going to choke hold and every time you wake up, I'm going to give you 10 seconds to kind of go.
0:44:45 - 0:44:47::And try and remember what it was.
0:44:47 - 0:44:49::I'm going to be like, just keep going.
0:44:49 - 0:44:50::Keep going.
0:44:50 - 0:44:51::Choke you back out.
0:44:51 - 0:44:53::And I'll be tickling your feet.
0:44:53 - 0:44:55::Yeah.
0:44:55 - 0:44:59::You want to get high as hell and let us kind of tickle your feet and...
0:44:59 - 0:45:00::Oh yeah.

0:45:00 - 0:45:08.400000::I basically sucked on Nate's fingers last week basically where he's sandwiches. Well you crushed up a
0:45:08.400000 - 0:45:15.640000::Cheat oh, that's right Dorito in your hand like all crumbly. Yeah sprinkled your hands all over my sandwich and I ate it
0:45:18.760000 - 0:45:24.760000::This unsolicited dude. I was just like check this out man. I need to do it
0:45:25.400000 - 0:45:31.300000::Because I wanted to go back to space. So we talked about the different astral bodies this less show bodies
0:45:31.300000 - 0:45:33.300000::We know that the sun start to us is
0:45:34.080000 - 0:45:40.440000::Basically called whatever how folks called the Sun Alpha Centauri. Yeah, we know there's life there
0:45:40.440000 - 0:45:42.840000::But nobody wants to admit it on the Sun
0:45:43.320000 - 0:45:45.320000::How's it really stranded on earth?
0:45:45.480000 - 0:45:47.320000::Yeah, we're trying to explore space
0:45:47.320000 - 0:45:54.360000::But it's like with the tools and the technology we have right now exploring spaces like throwing a pebble into the ocean with a human arm
0:45:54.880000 - 0:46:00.300000::It's going not that far, you know, I'm saying yeah, so we got it. I mean, it's not even like that
0:46:01 - 0:46:03.560000::I think you need to do yeah, go ahead
0:46:03.560000 - 0:46:10.120000::Glad you're well. I was just gonna build on Eric's metaphor thing and say it's not like throwing a pebble with a human arm into the ocean
0:46:10.120000 - 0:46:17.120000::It is like spitting out a fucking jujube from the parking lot all the way a mile down the sidewalk from the ocean
0:46:17.520000 - 0:46:20.320000::Yeah, and thinking of exploring space. Yeah
0:46:21.200000 - 0:46:28.800000::Here's what I think oh go ahead. I was gonna say like I feel like we could just end this right now of like
0:46:28.880000 - 0:46:33.740000::figuring out if there's something out there where they are etc. And here's what we need to do
0:46:34.400000 - 0:46:39.960000::We need satellites covering the earth blocking the Sun over a
0:46:40.840000 - 0:46:45.880000::A sort of shield, okay, and on each satellite we I want a
0:46:46.600000 - 0:46:56::Person on there with a turret machine gun and at and they are going to keep on firing in every which way direction out into space bullets
0:46:58.120000 - 0:47:00.120000::Until somebody comes out and it's like yo
0:47:04.280000 - 0:47:08::Whatever yeah, stop. Well, you know what's crazy Nate is
0:47:09.040000 - 0:47:14.440000::That unfortunately space is so big that if every single
0:47:15.440000 - 0:47:21.840000::Spot on the earth was having a bullet come out of it, you know what I'm trying to say every bit of surface area
0:47:22.680000 - 0:47:25.940000::The distance eventually would make those bullets so spaced out
0:47:26.960000 - 0:47:29.720000::That it probably wouldn't even hit 10% of the
0:47:29.720000 - 0:47:32.040000::Homemade rain shit that's out there
0:47:32.480000 - 0:47:41.080000::Bothering me at night. That's what we think is you know we put out that satellite with the capsule in it in the 70s that had like a picture of a man and a woman
0:47:41.080000 - 0:47:47.520000::The Beatles on a record right whatever no we need to be putting out crazy as the most powerful radio signal
0:47:49.640000 - 0:47:51.640000::With us whatever singing on it
0:47:55.760000 - 0:47:57.760000::Should we buy
0:47:58.160000 - 0:48:04.560000::Yeah, and that's that will hit in some language some language out there that understand that's a good people's
0:48:04.920000 - 0:48:07.920000::What is that called the golden records or something like that?
0:48:08.320000 - 0:48:10.320000::the golden
0:48:12.080000 - 0:48:14.080000::The things that you're describing
0:48:14.440000 - 0:48:17.360000::So record what everybody's discovered yet. No, no, no
0:48:17.360000 - 0:48:25.520000::We need the people's version of that because like NASA came up with oh here's the things that like aliens would want to know about us if they discovered like
0:48:25.520000 - 0:48:30.120000::Here's what our anatomy is like here's what the plants are like on here here's some music
0:48:30.120000 - 0:48:32.280000::Feel good. We smell good. We taste like
0:48:34 - 0:48:40.400000::Like a wet metal with some pretty jerky on it, right, but we need like peoples very half a
0:48:41.080000 - 0:48:43.080000::bottle of vitamin water the triple X
0:48:43.480000 - 0:48:45.480000::I said you bury vitamin water
0:48:45.480000 - 0:48:50.960000::You need like a pink a 20 pink pistol 24 hour cycle of MTV 2
0:48:51.720000 - 0:48:57.360000::Yeah, the early 2000s and you need to put Ryan Reynolds all cryogenically frozen
0:49:01.080000 - 0:49:06.240000::And then we want to see that movie by the way when he lands. Yeah, I want to see that movie. I'll go pro style
0:49:07.240000 - 0:49:09.560000::He's fucking annihilated immediately like
0:49:16.440000 - 0:49:22.760000::Damn why are we so crazy for thinking about all this stuff Ryan Reynolds isn't he just made me
0:49:23.960000 - 0:49:27.680000::It just made me so sad to think about Ryan Reynolds getting evaporated like that
0:49:28.520000 - 0:49:33.720000::I know because then what would happen to mint mobile, you know, mint mobile. What's that a gum?
0:49:33.720000 - 0:49:35.720000::He's he's a CEO now, right?
0:49:35.720000 - 0:49:42.320000::What's the whole mobile dude? He's sold an novel to T-Mobile and made millions. Oh, this is what I wanted to say today
0:49:44.680000 - 0:49:47.640000::Well, I guess I'll save it because it's gonna be what gave me joy
0:49:50.080000 - 0:49:55.280000::So I don't know I think just like sometimes when we talk about space I can tell from you guys right now
0:49:55.960000 - 0:50:00::We talk about the grandness of it. We talk about just what could be out?

0:50:00 - 0:50:02.500000::And instead of exciting us it depresses us
0:50:03.240000 - 0:50:08.980000::Right because I think us three want to be in control so bad over what we know and what we can do in this life that
0:50:09.400000 - 0:50:13.200000::Thinking about space makes this lose control, you know what I'm saying so I
0:50:14.760000 - 0:50:21.260000::Don't want control. I don't want it. I don't want control. I don't want information. I don't want responsibility
0:50:21.260000 - 0:50:27.800000::I don't want any of that shit. I want to be the dumbest person on the fucking planet, but guess what I

0:52:08.840000 - 0:52:16.280000::What gave me I need to say this right now because I'm so proud of my damn dog, okay bubbles one of the craziest dogs a lot of people have
0:52:16.280000 - 0:52:21.200000::Met she's very sweet, but today we took her ass to the reservoir
0:52:22 - 0:52:26.620000::And we walked her around and she crushed it no barking
0:52:27.040000 - 0:52:33.640000::Having fun sniffing everything coming back responding well to the recall she's eating chicken like you can't believe
0:52:34.200000 - 0:52:38.340000::So the shout out goes the bubbles today for just body and

0:52:54.600000 - 0:53:00.200000::So I'm gonna watch the finale tonight television history will be made tonight
0:53:00.600000 - 0:53:06.640000::When I don't know what the hell Jesse Armstrong has got cooked up in his fucking brain

0:53:19.080000 - 0:53:24.320000::succeed in that's the I don't even know I haven't you know what my prediction was can I give a prediction?
0:53:24.320000 - 0:53:28.920000::I hope this isn't like it wouldn't be a spoiler because it's a prediction. It wouldn't that's right
0:53:28.920000 - 0:53:30.920000::I think that
0:53:30.920000 - 0:53:32.920000::Kendall Roy's
0:53:32.920000 - 0:53:34.920000::Kid is going to be killed

0:53:49.160000 - 0:53:54.040000::There's a good I think something's gonna happen with it's gonna be like Gotham style
0:53:54.200000 - 0:53:59.240000::You know because they're kind of turning the succession world into like a sort of Gotham like
0:54:00.200000 - 0:54:04.600000::Maybe some kind of crazy villain pops up for something you should have played the villain in success
0:54:05.240000 - 0:54:07.240000::That's some kind of old man
0:54:11.080000 - 0:54:13.800000::Takes like a hard like right turn in the whole series
0:54:14.440000 - 0:54:18.680000::Give it up for turning right anyways that probably won't happen, but I just thought of that
0:54:19.240000 - 0:54:21.240000::But I don't know who's gonna see
0:54:22.200000 - 0:54:27.800000::Yeah, who knows that do with this the tiny neck. I think it's gonna be this the next CEO. Oh, I gotta watch that shit
0:54:27.800000 - 0:54:31.880000::The do with the thin neck. Oh, why is neck so tiny cuz it's probably a medical reason yeah
0:54:32.520000 - 0:54:37.160000::All right, should I make a prediction? I've never I haven't seen even one episode of succession
0:54:37.720000 - 0:54:41.400000::So I can get this right, but I am going to a finale party tonight
0:54:42.200000 - 0:54:45.480000::And if I can get this right I feel like I deserve some money
0:54:46.120000 - 0:54:48.600000::Okay, so I'm gonna say Logan Roy
0:54:49.480000 - 0:54:50.840000::um

0:54:55.400000 - 0:54:57.400000::company which
0:54:57.800000 - 0:54:59.800000::Leaves none of the children

0:55:00 - 0:55:05::to success, success the be his successor.
0:55:05.280000 - 0:55:09.520000::And what's gonna happen is we are setting ourselves up
0:55:09.520000 - 0:55:13.640000::for four years from now, a spin off series
0:55:13.640000 - 0:55:17.340000::with the children and one new character.
0:55:18.600000 - 0:55:19.600000::Elf.
0:55:19.600000 - 0:55:20.600000::Elf played by John.
0:55:20.600000 - 0:55:21.440000::That.
0:55:21.440000 - 0:55:22.440000::That.
0:55:23.440000 - 0:55:27.240000::And if I'm right, everybody has to upgrade their Patreon
0:55:27.240000 - 0:55:29.840000::tier to $6,000 a day.
0:55:29.880000 - 0:55:30.680000::Wow.

0:55:33.240000 - 0:55:35::in the succession callback series.
0:55:37 - 0:55:38.760000::That's the might mean you're redneck.
0:55:38.760000 - 0:55:42.120000::All right, let me say what gave me my the fucking joy.
0:55:42.120000 - 0:55:43.120000::It's here, dude.
0:55:44.040000 - 0:55:48.360000::Well, I was walking around feeling like,
0:55:48.360000 - 0:55:50.160000::why don't I belong?
0:55:50.160000 - 0:55:53.960000::Why do I not belong seemingly anywhere in my entire life?
0:55:53.960000 - 0:55:57.480000::I always feel like I go into a store.
0:55:57.480000 - 0:55:59.720000::I don't belong on these shelves, essentially.
0:55:59.720000 - 0:56:03.080000::I feel like a weird iPhone that nobody carries.
0:56:03.080000 - 0:56:04.600000::And I'm feeling depressed.
0:56:05.480000 - 0:56:09.080000::And I what I realize is what I remember is
0:56:09.080000 - 0:56:13.640000::from my stock trading days when Elon Musk went on SNL
0:56:13.640000 - 0:56:18.640000::and I made negative $200 is that I need to buy the dip.
0:56:20.760000 - 0:56:22.240000::Oh, most definitely.
0:56:22.240000 - 0:56:23.240000::No, no, be careful, be careful.
0:56:23.240000 - 0:56:26.320000::Because I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.
0:56:26.320000 - 0:56:28.320000::No, listen, no, listen, no, listen.
0:56:28.320000 - 0:56:32.360000::Because when your happiness is in a dip,
0:56:32.360000 - 0:56:33.840000::when you're feeling depressed,
0:56:33.840000 - 0:56:38.840000::that's when you need to buy stuff to make yourself happy.
0:56:38.840000 - 0:56:42.920000::The only way what I did is I went on Amazon
0:56:42.920000 - 0:56:47.640000::and I spent all my savings on different shoes
0:56:47.640000 - 0:56:48.640000::that I think I'll be able to,
0:56:48.640000 - 0:56:51.400000::well, I think we'll go out of stock, the Yeasies.
0:56:51.400000 - 0:56:53.240000::And I'm gonna hold onto them.
0:56:53.240000 - 0:56:54.320000::I'm moving out of New York.
0:56:54.320000 - 0:56:55.920000::I'm gonna put them in a storage facility.
0:56:55.920000 - 0:56:57.040000::I'm gonna move in with my parents
0:56:57.040000 - 0:56:59.360000::and try and sell that shit in a couple of years.
0:57:01.480000 - 0:57:02.800000::And this is kind of my last shot
0:57:02.800000 - 0:57:07.800000::because I haven't made that much money lately.
0:57:09.600000 - 0:57:11.080000::You know what you should do is,
0:57:11.080000 - 0:57:13::but you know what, that's a good,
0:57:13 - 0:57:13.920000::that's a good strategy.
0:57:13.920000 - 0:57:14.760000::I like that.
0:57:14.760000 - 0:57:16.320000::You should treat yourself.
0:57:16.320000 - 0:57:17.480000::But you know what you should do?
0:57:17.480000 - 0:57:18.680000::It's a fucking shit.
0:57:18.680000 - 0:57:20.200000::What did you say?
0:57:20.200000 - 0:57:21.040000::Huh?
0:57:21.040000 - 0:57:22.880000::Well, you gotta stop doing this sit on the Zoom.
0:57:22.880000 - 0:57:24.080000::Oh, treat yourself.
0:57:24.080000 - 0:57:24.920000::Yeah, yeah, yeah.
0:57:24.920000 - 0:57:26.040000::What did you think I said?
0:57:26.040000 - 0:57:26.880000::You should treat yourself.
0:57:26.880000 - 0:57:27.720000::I don't know.
0:57:27.720000 - 0:57:28.560000::You should treat yourself.
0:57:28.560000 - 0:57:29.400000::You should treat yourself.
0:57:29.400000 - 0:57:30.840000::But you should treat yourself.
0:57:30.840000 - 0:57:32.440000::Hey, no, no, no.

0:57:47.240000 - 0:57:50.920000::and fucking put a bunch of Yeasies in there and bury it.
0:57:50.920000 - 0:57:53.280000::So, you know, close to the ground
0:57:53.280000 - 0:57:56.120000::where a future generation could, you know, dig it up.
